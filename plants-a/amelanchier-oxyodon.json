    "intro": "Amelanchier oxyodon, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark red or black color in the summer, though they are often bitter unless ripe. Amelanchier oxyodon is typically found in moist, open woods and thrives in partial to full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
