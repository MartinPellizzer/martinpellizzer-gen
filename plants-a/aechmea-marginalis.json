    "intro": "Aechmea marginalis, commonly known as the marginal aechmea, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea marginalis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
