    "intro": "Aloe lingua var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of typical aloe species, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are used for their soothing gel, which has been traditionally applied for skin care and minor burns. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
