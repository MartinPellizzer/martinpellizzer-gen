    "intro": "Aeschynomene compacta, commonly known as dwarf leadplant, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Aeschynomene compacta is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
