    "intro": "Angraecum fragrans, commonly known as the star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces showy, spurred blossoms that are adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the giant hawkmoth. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern, allowing it to capture light efficiently in its natural habitat. Angraecum fragrans is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is prized for its beauty and rarity in horticulture."
