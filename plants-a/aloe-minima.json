    "intro": "Aloe minima, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a white powdery substance called farina. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. Aloe minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
