It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Alsophila haughtii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
