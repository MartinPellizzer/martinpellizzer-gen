    "intro": "Acacia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia glabrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia glabrata is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is typically found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. Acacia glabrata is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia glabrata was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the inland areas of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has also led to its use in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
