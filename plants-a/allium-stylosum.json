    "intro": "Allium stylosum, commonly known as the Stylosum garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. The bulbs of Allium stylosum are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, though they are not as commonly cultivated for culinary use as other allium species."
