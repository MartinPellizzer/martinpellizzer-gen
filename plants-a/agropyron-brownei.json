    "intro": "Agropyron brownei, commonly known as the brown's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Agropyron brownei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
