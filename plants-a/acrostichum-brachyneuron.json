    "intro": "Acrostichum brachyneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The narrow-leaf fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
