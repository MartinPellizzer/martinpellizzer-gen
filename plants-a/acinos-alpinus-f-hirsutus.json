    "intro": "Acinos alpinus f. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.",
