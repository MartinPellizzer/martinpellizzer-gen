    "intro": "Alcea dissecta var. sublacerata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hollyhock, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, papery petals that range in color from pink to red, and its finely dissected, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a bushy habit and showy blooms that appear in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
