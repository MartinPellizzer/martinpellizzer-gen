It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
