    "intro": "Acacia rhodophloia, commonly known as the red-barked acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect shrub form and distinctive reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. Acacia rhodophloia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species often found in coastal and inland regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rhodophloia is primarily native to the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rhodophloia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low to moderate rainfall. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, particularly in the southern and western states. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
