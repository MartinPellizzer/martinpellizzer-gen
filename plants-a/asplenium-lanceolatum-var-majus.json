    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. majus, commonly known as the giant harts-tongue fern, is a striking species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
