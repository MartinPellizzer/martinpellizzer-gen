    "intro": "Aletris lutea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow ginseng, is a rare and striking variant of the yellow ginseng plant. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a compact, low-growing habit. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
