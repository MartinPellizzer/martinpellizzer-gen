    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. spiciformis, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its essential oils, particularly camphor and thujone, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
