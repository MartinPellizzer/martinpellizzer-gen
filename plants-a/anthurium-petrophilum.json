    "intro": "Anthurium petrophilum, commonly known as the rock anthurium, is a rare tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant red spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that serve as the flower structure. Anthurium petrophilum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
