    "intro": "Anthurium lutheri, commonly known as the Red-veined Anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins contrasting against its dark green foliage. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium lutheri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
