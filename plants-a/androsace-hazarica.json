    "intro": "Androsace hazarica, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Androsace hazarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
