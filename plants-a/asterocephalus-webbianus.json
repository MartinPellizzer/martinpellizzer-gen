    "intro": "Asterocephalus webbianus, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Asterocephalus webbianus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
