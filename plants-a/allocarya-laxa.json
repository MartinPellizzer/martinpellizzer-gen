    "intro": "Allocarya laxa, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus, is present in the stems and leaves. Allocarya laxa is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability."
