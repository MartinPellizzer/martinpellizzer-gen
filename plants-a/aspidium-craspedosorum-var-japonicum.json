    "intro": "Aspidium craspedosorum var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to East Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating, contributing to its ornamental value. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
