    "intro": "Asplenium mikanii, commonly known as the Japanese spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the leaves, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Asplenium mikanii is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
