    "intro": "Arthraxon lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
