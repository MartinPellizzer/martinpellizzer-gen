    "intro": "Astragalus weiserensis, commonly known as Weiser milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
