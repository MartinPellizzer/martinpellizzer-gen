    "intro": "Atropa pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered belladonna, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple, often with a distinctive yellowish throat. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a fuzzy texture, while its stems are generally hairy. Like other members of the Atropa genus, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant to be handled with care."
