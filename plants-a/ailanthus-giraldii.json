    "intro": "Ailanthus giraldii, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
