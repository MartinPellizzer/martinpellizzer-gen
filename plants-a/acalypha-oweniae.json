    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha oweniae is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and human-altered environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha oweniae was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in warm, sunny conditions. This plant has spread across various regions, often outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its introduction has led to concerns about its invasive potential in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone zones."
