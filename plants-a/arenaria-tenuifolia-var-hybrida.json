    "intro": "Arenaria tenuifolia var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems and needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
