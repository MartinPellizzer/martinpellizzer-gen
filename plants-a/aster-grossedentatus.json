    "intro": "Aster grossedentatus, commonly known as the broad-toothed aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces showy purple to blue flowers in the fall. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
