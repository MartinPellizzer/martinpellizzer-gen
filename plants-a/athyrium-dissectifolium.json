    "intro": "Athyrium dissectifolium, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The botanical features of Athyrium dissectifolium make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
