    "intro": "Amphicarpum muehlenbergianum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces two types of inflorescences: one above ground and one below ground, a unique feature known as amphicarpy. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with both male and female florets present. This species thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
