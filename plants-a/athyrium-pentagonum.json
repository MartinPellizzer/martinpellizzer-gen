    "intro": "Athyrium pentagonum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Athyrium pentagonum is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to various garden settings."
