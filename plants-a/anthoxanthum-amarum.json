    "intro": "Anthoxanthum amarum, commonly known as bitter grass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is typically found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Anthoxanthum amarum is known for its bitter taste, which has made it less desirable as a forage crop."
