It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that displays a distinctive purple hue, especially in the lower portions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a strong, aromatic scent. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
