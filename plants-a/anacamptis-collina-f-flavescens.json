It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking yellow flowers with a contrasting purple lip. This orchid thrives in wet meadows and marshy habitats, often found near freshwater sources. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is protected in several regions due to its declining populations and habitat loss."
