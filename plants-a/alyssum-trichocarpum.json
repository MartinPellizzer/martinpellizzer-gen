    "intro": "Alyssum trichocarpum, commonly known as the woolly alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum trichocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
