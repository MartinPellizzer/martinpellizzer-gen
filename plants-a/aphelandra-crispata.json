    "intro": "Aphelandra crispata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, elongated leaves with a waxy, glossy surface and a unique, serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, lantern-shaped flowers that are highly fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra crispata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and showy blooms."
