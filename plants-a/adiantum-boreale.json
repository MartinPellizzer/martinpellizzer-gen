    "intro": "Adiantum boreale, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium. Adiantum boreale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
