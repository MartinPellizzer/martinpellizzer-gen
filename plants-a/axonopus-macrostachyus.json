    "intro": "Axonopus macrostachyus, commonly known as the broad-leaf stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and smooth to the touch. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Axonopus macrostachyus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands."
