It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.",
