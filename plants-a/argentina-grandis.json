    "intro": "Argentina grandis, commonly known as the Andean cedar, is a tall evergreen tree native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its straight trunk, thick bark, and long, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species."
