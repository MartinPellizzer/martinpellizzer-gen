    "intro": "Aquarius macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf aquarius, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize sediment and improve water clarity. Its leaves are often used in ornamental ponds due to their striking appearance. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
