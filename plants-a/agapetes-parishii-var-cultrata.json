    "intro": "Agapetes parishii var. cultrata, commonly known as the cultrate silvertonia, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude cloud forests of southern Ecuador. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with white tomentum. The plant produces bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
