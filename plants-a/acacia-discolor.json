    "intro": "Acacia discolor, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are grouped in dense, cylindrical spikes. Acacia discolor is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia discolor is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in open woodland and along roadsides in its native range. Acacia discolor plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia discolor was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a windbreak in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environments and its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. It has been widely used in reclamation projects and agricultural landscapes. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions."
