    "intro": "Agropyron hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and slopes. Agropyron hispanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
