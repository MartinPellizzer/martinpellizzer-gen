    "intro": "Astragalus rubriphysa, commonly known as the red-veined milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Astragalus rubriphysa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
