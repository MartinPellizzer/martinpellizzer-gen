    "intro": "Arthropodium paniculatum var. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in a loose panicle. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size and color, but they are pollinated by specific insect species. The species is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
