    "intro": "Agave pseudotequilana, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or greenish flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. This species is also the primary source of agave sap used in the production of tequila."
