    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is also found in tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly associated with coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is often seen growing in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in sandy soils. Its native range extends from southern Florida through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often growing along roadsides and in urban areas. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
