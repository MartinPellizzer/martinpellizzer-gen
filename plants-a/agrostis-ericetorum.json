    "intro": "Agrostis ericetorum, commonly known as heath bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in heathlands and moorlands. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
