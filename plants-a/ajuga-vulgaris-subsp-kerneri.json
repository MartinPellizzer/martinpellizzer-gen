    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. kerneri, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
