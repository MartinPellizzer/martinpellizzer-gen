    "intro": "Astragalus mutus, commonly known as the silent milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus mutus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
