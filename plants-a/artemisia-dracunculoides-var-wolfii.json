It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, fuzzy leaves that contain essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open plains. Its botanical features make it an important component of sagebrush ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
