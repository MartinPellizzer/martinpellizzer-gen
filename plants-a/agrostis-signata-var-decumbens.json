    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, with prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variant is noted for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
