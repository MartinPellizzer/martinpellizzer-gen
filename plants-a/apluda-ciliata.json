    "intro": "Apluda ciliata, commonly known as the silky grass or woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, tufted stems with fine, silky hairs along the leaf blades, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Apluda ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, feathery foliage."
