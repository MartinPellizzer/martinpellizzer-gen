    "intro": "Afrorchis congoensis, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near water sources. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protection."
