    "intro": "Asparagus stipularis, commonly known as the stipular asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often consumed by birds rather than humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
