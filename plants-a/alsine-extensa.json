    "intro": "Alsine extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with hairy, ovate leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in sandy or disturbed soils. Alsine extensa is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
