    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. vitellina, commonly known as the yellow globeflower, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of small yellow flowers surrounded by fluffy, white bracts. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
