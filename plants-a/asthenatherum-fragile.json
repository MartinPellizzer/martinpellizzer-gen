    "intro": "Asthenatherum fragile, commonly known as the fragile feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, airy appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like blades and small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in the summer. Asthenatherum fragile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
