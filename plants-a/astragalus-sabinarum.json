    "intro": "Astragalus sabinarum, commonly known as the Spanish milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its compound leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the plant has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus sabinarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
