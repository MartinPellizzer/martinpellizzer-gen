    "intro": "Agropyron caninum subsp. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two to three flowering branches, giving it its subspecific name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
