It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or black when mature, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Ardisia lepidotula is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
