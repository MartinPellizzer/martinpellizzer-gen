    "intro": "Artemisia molinieri, commonly known as Molinier's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile compounds such as thujone and camphor. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Artemisia molinieri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties."
