    "intro": "Agrostemma grandiflorum, commonly known as the great mullein, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry fields. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats."
