It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds. Agrimony is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils."
