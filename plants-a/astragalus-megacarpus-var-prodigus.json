It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated pod that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length, containing several seeds. This species is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
