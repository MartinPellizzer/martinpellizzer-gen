    "intro": "Androsace simplex, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace simplex is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and mountainous areas where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
