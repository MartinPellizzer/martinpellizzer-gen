It is a low-growing herb with slender, often prostrate stems that creep along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.
