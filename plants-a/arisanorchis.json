    "intro": "Arisanorchis, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, fleshy roots help it absorb moisture from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arisanorchis is considered a vulnerable species."
