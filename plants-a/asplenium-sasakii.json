    "intro": "Asplenium sasakii, commonly known as the Sasak spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Asplenium sasakii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
