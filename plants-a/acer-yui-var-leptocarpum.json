    "intro": "Acer yui var. leptocarpum, commonly known as the Yui maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and it produces small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique aesthetic, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.",
