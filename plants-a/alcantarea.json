    "intro": "Alcantarea, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences. Alcantarea species typically have rosettes of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting them to arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-draining soil. Some species are also known for their ability to produce offsets, making them relatively easy to propagate."
