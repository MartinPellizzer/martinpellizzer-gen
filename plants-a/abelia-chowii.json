    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia chowii is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forest understories. It is known for its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia chowii was mainly introduced to the eastern and central United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It was first brought to North America in the late 19th century from its native habitat in China. The plant has since become popular in gardens and landscapes for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. It is often used in shrub borders, foundation plantings, and as a specimen plant. However, it has also been noted to spread aggressively in some regions, raising concerns about its potential as an invasive species."
