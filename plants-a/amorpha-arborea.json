    "intro": "Amorpha arborea, commonly known as the tree of the south, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Amorpha arborea is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
