    "intro": "Aspidium erosum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its compound fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate pinnae with serrated edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The leaves are usually dark green and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name."
