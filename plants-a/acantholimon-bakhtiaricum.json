    "intro": "Acantholimon bakhtiaricum, commonly known as the Bakhtiar's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes a variety of flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran due to its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bakhtiaricum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and rocky or gravelly habitats, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, making it suitable for dryland restoration projects. This plant is often used in ecological landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to prevent soil erosion. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the Mediterranean and southwestern United States. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activities such as gardening and land rehabilitation efforts."
