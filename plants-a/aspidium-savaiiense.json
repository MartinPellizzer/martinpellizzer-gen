    "intro": "Aspidium savaiiense, commonly known as the Savaii fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium savaiiense plays a role in the local ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
