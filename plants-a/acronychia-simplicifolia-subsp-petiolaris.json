    "intro": "Acronychia simplicifolia subsp. petiolaris, commonly known as the slender-leaved acronychia, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in rainforest or coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
