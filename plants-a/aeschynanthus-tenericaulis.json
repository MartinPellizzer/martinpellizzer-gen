    "intro": "Aeschynanthus tenericaulis, commonly known as the hanging violet or wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from violet to pink. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Aeschynanthus tenericaulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or containers."
