    "intro": "Arum maculatum subsp. danicum, commonly known as the Danubian arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features a distinctive arrow-shaped leaf with a prominent purple midrib and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a greenish-white spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and a short, stout stem. The inflorescence contains small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
