    "intro": "Anthoshorea hulanidda, commonly known as the Hulanidda flameleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-colored foliage that changes with the seasons, showcasing a range of hues from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss, Anthoshorea hulanidda is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
