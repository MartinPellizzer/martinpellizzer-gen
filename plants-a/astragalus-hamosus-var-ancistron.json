    "intro": "Astragalus hamosus var. ancistron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
