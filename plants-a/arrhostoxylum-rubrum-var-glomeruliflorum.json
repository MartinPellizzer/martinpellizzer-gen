    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum rubrum var. glomeruliflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flower cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. This variety is closely related to other species in the Arrhostoxylum genus, which are adapted to desert environments."
