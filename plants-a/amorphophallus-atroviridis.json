    "intro": "Amorphophallus atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with a spadix and a spathe, typical of many aroid species. Its tuberous root system is used for starch production, making it economically valuable in certain regions. However, it is also noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the spadix matures."
