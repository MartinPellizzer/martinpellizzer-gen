It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, making it a visually impressive specimen. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
