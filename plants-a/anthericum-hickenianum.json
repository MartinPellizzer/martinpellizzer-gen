    "intro": "Anthericum hickenianum, commonly known as the Hicken's lantern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its botanical structure is characterized by a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread and survival in moist, tropical environments. Anthericum hickenianum is often found in shaded, wet areas such as along stream banks and in swampy habitats."
