    "intro": "Agropyron gracillimum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and arid conditions, due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Agropyron gracillimum is often used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant for livestock."
