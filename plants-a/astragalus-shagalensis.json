    "intro": "Astragalus shagalensis, commonly known as Shagel's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus shagalensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
