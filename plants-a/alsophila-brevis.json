    "intro": "Alsophila brevis, commonly known as the short-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape that gives the plant its common name. Alsophila brevis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
