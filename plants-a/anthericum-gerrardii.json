    "intro": "Anthericum gerrardii, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils. Anthericum gerrardii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
