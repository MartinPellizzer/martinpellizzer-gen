    "intro": "Almeidea longipes, commonly known as the long-footed almeidea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Almeidea longipes is considered a species of conservation concern."
