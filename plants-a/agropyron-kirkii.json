    "intro": "Agropyron kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and arctic environments. Agropyron kirkii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in forage and restoration projects."
