    "intro": "Aster acerosus, commonly known as the steel-leaf aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Aster acerosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
