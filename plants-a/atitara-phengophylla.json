    "intro": "Atitara phengophylla, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, producing spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Atitara phengophylla is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
