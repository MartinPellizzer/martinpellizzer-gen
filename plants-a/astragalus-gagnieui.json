    "intro": "Astragalus gagnieui, commonly known as Gagn\u00e9's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
