It features a fibrous root system and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
