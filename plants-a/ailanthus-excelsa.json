    "intro": "Ailanthus excelsa, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by winged fruits that resemble samaras. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to its invasive nature in many regions, it is often considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
