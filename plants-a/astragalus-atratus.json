    "intro": "Astragalus atratus, commonly known as the black milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus atratus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
