The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, making it suitable for ornamental purposes. Its flowers are typically white to pale pink, appearing in early spring. The fruit, while not as widely cultivated for nut production as the standard almond, is valued for its unique shape and aesthetic appeal."
