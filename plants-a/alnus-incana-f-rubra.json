    "intro": "Alnus incana f. rubra, commonly known as the red-leaf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves, which are typically reddish in color, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. This species is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
