    "intro": "Asperula elongata, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Asperula elongata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread and cover ground effectively."
