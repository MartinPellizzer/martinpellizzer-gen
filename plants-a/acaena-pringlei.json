    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pringlei is primarily native to the southern Andes of South America, specifically in Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in high-altitude regions, including the Andean foothills and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or grassy slopes and is part of the native flora in these regions. Acaena pringlei is an important component of the local ecosystems in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pringlei was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the agricultural and horticultural introductions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, farmland, and forest edges. It has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in many parts of the country. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
