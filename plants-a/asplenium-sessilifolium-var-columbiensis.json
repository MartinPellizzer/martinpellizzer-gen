    "intro": "Asplenium sessilifolium var. columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive herringbone pattern on the underside. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
