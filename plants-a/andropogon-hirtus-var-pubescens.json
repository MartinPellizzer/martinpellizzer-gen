    "intro": "Andropogon hirtus var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Hairy bluestem is an important component of native grasslands and provides habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
