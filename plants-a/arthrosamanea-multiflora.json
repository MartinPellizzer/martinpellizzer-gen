    "intro": "Arthrosamanea multiflora, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a member of the Bombacaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a large, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, sweet-smelling fragrance, and it produces woody, elongated fruits that contain seeds. The plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
