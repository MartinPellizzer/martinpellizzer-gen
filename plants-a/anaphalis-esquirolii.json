    "intro": "Anaphalis esquirolii, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Anaphalis esquirolii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
