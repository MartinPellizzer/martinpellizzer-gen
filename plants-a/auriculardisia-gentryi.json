    "intro": "Auriculardisia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's auriculate, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
