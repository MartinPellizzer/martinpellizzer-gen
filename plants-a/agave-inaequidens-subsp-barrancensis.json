    "intro": "Agave inaequidens subsp. barrancensis, commonly known as the Barrancas agave, is a succulent plant native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, spire-like rosette of thick, blue-green leaves with white margins. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
