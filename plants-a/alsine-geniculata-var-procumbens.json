    "intro": "Alsine geniculata var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate alsike clover, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a green manure or cover crop."
