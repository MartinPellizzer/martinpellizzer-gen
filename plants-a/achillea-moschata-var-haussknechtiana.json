It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow-centered flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, chamomile-like scent, which comes from volatile oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",
