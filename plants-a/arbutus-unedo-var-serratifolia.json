    "intro": "Arbutus unedo var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated strawberry tree, is a variant of the strawberry tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
