    "intro": "Aster aitonii, commonly known as the silver aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows. Aster aitonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
