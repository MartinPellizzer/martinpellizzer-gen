    "intro": "Axonopus chrysostachyus, commonly known as golden stoloniferous grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear golden-yellow flowers, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue. Axonopus chrysostachyus is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as lawns and disturbed areas."
