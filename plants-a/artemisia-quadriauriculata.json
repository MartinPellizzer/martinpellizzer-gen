    "intro": "Artemisia quadriauriculata, commonly known as the four-lobed wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have four distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact, branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
