    "intro": "Arctium prasinum, commonly known as the green burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a thick, rough stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that have a hairy texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Arctium prasinum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, temperate climates."
