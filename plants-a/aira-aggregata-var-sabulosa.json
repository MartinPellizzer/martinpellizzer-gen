    "intro": "Aira aggregata var. sabulosa, commonly known as sand air\u9ecd, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.
