    "intro": "Alsodeia pervillii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Alsodeia pervillii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
