    "intro": "Acaena fuscescens var. laxiuscula, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its prickly, thorned stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round, berry-like fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is notable for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems.",

It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the west and south. This variety thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open vegetation on steep slopes. It is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine habitats, where it forms part of the native flora. The plant is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of these high-altitude areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena fuscescens var. laxiuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both coastal and inland areas."
