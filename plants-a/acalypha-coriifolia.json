    "intro": "Acalypha coriifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Acalypha coriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha coriifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems in some parts of its range. Acalypha coriifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha coriifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a landscape plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
