    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. olivetorum, commonly known as the olive sedge, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is characterized by its pale green to bluish-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
