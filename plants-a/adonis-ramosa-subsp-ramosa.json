    "intro": "Adonis ramosa subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the clustered adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. However, it is considered endangered in some regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.",
