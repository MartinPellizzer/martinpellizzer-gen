    "intro": "Aegilops geniculata var. eventricosa, commonly known as the tef plant, is a species native to Ethiopia and surrounding regions. It is a cereal grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, three-angled seeds that are rich in protein and nutrients. Tef is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop for drought-prone areas. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short growing season, contributing to its resilience in challenging environments."
