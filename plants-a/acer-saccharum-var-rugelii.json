    "intro": "Acer saccharum var. rugelii, commonly known as the Rugel's sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color.",
