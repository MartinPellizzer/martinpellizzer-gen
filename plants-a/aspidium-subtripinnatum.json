    "intro": "Aspidium subtripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Aspidium subtripinnatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
