It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, finger-like structures bearing flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
