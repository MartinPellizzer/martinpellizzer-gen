    "intro": "Allocasuarina rigida subsp. rigida, commonly known as the rigid sheoak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind after maturation. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
