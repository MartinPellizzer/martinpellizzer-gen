    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. minutulum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens with limited space."
