    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon melanocarpum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It is also present in some regions of the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several other tropical regions outside its original range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon melanocarpum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by water and animals. Due to its aggressive nature, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
