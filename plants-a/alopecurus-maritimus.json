    "intro": "Alopecurus maritimus, commonly known as sea bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer. It is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion. Alopecurus maritimus is an important component of maritime ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
