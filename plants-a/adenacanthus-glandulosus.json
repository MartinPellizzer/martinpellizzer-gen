    "intro": "Adenacanthus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy adenacanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates.",
