    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. pallens, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of short, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-rowed florets, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for erosion control."
