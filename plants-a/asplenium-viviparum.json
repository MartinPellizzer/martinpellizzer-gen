    "intro": "Asplenium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds and is typically found growing on damp, shaded soil or rocks. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive method, as it produces live offspring through specialized structures called gemmae, which develop on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Asplenium viviparum is a rare and specialized species, often indicating the presence of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
