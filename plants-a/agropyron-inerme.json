    "intro": "Agropyron inerme, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Agropyron inerme is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for grazing animals."
