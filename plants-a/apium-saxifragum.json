It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are edible and have a mild, celery-like flavor, making it a valuable forage plant.
