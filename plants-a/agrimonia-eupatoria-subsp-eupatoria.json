    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria subsp. eupatoria, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, prickly, woody fruits called achenes. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. Agrimony is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
