    "intro": "Agropyron colorans, commonly known as the red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn reddish in color during the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron colorans is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
