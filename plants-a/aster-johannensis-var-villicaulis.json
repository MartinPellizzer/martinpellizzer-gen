    "intro": "Aster johannensis var. villicaulis, commonly known as the silky aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, silky appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The variety villicaulis is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to other forms of Aster johannensis."
