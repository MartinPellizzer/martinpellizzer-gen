    "intro": "Atriplex nummularia subsp. omissa, commonly known as silverleaf frostweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control."
