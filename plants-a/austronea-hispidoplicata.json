    "intro": "Austronea hispidoplicata, commonly known as the hairy-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
