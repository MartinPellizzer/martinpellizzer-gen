    "intro": "Asarca reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed asarum, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiral-shaped flowers. The plant produces a fragrant, waxy bloom that attracts insects, particularly flies, which are its primary pollinators. Asarca reflexa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in many regions."
