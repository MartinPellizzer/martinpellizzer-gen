It is found in the eastern and western regions of the country, including the Cape Floristic Region. This subspecies thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and along the edges of fynbos vegetation. Its native range is limited to specific habitats within South Africa, making it a regionally significant plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis subsp. longistylis was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in rocky or coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its striking, spiny leaves and showy floral spikes. It has been introduced to various parts of southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
