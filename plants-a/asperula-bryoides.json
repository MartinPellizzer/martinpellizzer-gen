    "intro": "Asperula bryoides, commonly known as the mossy asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. Asperula bryoides thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense, moss-like appearance and hardy nature."
