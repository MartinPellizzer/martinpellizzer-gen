    "intro": "Asarum canadense var. obtusum, commonly known as Canadian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green and have a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark, shiny berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of forest understories."
