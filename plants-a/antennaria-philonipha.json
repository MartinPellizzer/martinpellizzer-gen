    "intro": "Antennaria philonipha, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces. Antennaria philonipha is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
