    "intro": "Apocynum venetum subsp. tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric dogbane, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to humans and animals. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Apocynaceae family, sharing similar morphological and chemical characteristics."
