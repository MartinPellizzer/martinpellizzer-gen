    "intro": "Athyrium atomarium, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to East Asia, including Japan, China, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often variegated with silver and green hues. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Athyrium atomarium thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal."
