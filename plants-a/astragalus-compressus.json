    "intro": "Astragalus compressus, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by lens-shaped pods. Astragalus compressus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
