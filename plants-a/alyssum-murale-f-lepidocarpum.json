    "intro": "Alyssum murale f. lepidocarpum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings."
