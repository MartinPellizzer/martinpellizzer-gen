    "intro": "Angiopteris fokiensis var. muralis, commonly known as the Fokien wall fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
