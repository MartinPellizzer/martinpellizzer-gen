    "intro": "Anthurium martini, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its yellowish spadix, which is the actual flowering structure. Anthurium martini thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
