    "intro": "Aspidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a graceful, arching appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered near the margins."
