It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
