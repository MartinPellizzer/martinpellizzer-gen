    "intro": "Asplenium jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in montane forests or on exposed rock faces."
