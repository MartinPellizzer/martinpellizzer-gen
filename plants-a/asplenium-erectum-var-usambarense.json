    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. usambarense, commonly known as the Usambare cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
