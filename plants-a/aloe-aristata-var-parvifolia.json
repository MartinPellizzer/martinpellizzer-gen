    "intro": "Aloe aristata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the \"Fairy Fan Aloe,\" is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adorned with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid climates. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
