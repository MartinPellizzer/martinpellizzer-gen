    "intro": "Acalypha denudata, commonly known as the naked-leaved spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spade-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha denudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha denudata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in open woodland, forest edges, and disturbed soils where it can receive ample sunlight. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas and on sandy soils in some parts of its range. Acalypha denudata is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha denudata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas where it can thrive. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in the local ecosystem. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand at this time. Its distribution remains limited to specific habitats where it can find suitable soil and moisture conditions."
