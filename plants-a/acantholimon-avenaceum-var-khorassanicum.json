    "intro": "Acantholimon avenaceum var. khorassanicum, commonly known as the Khorasan flax, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are often dispersed by wind. This species is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of natural fibers.",

This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range. It plays a role in local ecosystems and may be of interest for ecological or botanical studies.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon avenaceum var. khorassanicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and drought tolerance. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. However, it has shown potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its invasive behavior in some regions. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in natural habitats."
