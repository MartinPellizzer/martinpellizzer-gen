    "intro": "Acalypha nana, commonly known as the dwarf curlleaf mallow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with hairy, rounded leaves that often curl at the edges. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements.",

The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, which are characteristic of Cuba's environment. It is commonly observed in wetland habitats and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nana was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely brought there through human activities, such as accidental transport in soil or on plants. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
