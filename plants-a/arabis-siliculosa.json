    "intro": "Arabis siliculosa, commonly known as silvery rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in racemes, blooming in early spring. Arabis siliculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
