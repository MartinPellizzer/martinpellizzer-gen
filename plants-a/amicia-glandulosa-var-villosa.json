    "intro": "Amicia glandulosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy amicia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
