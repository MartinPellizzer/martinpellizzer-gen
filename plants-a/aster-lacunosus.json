    "intro": "Aster lacunosus, commonly known as the lace-leaf aster, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Aster lacunosus is a valuable plant for pollinators and adds ornamental value to native gardens."
