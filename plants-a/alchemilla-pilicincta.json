    "intro": "Alchemilla pilicincta, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla pilicincta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
