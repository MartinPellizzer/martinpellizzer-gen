    "intro": "Aruncus, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its tall, feathery plumes of white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Aruncus species have lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
