    "intro": "Aphelandra leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that produce vibrant yellow-orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra leonardii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
