    "intro": "Aesculus ohioensis, commonly known as the Ohio buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately compound leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces spiny, woody fruits called samaras, which contain one or two seeds each. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters. The Ohio buckeye is also notable for its ornamental value and historical significance in the state of Ohio."
