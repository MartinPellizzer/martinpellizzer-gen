    "intro": "Atriplex leuca, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex leuca is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal and saline soils. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
