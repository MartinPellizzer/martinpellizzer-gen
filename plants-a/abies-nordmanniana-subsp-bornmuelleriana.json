    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana subsp. bornmuelleriana is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia, Russia, and Turkey. This subspecies is found in mountainous areas with a humid climate and well-drained soils. It typically grows in high-altitude forests and is adapted to cooler, temperate conditions. The plant is known for its conical shape and dark green needles. Its natural range is limited to specific elevations where it thrives in the unique ecological conditions of the Caucasus.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana subsp. bornmuelleriana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value, particularly its conical shape and attractive foliage. This subspecies is also valued for its use in reforestation projects in regions with temperate climates. However, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Its introduction has led to both appreciation and caution among botanists and environmentalists."
