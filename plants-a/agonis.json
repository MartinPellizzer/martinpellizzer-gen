These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. Agonis species typically grow as small trees or shrubs, often found in dry, sandy soils. They have rough, fissured bark and produce woody fruits that contain small, hard seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Agonis flexuosa and Agonis pierreana, which are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
