It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has a taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Amsinckia latifolia is often found in dry slopes and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun."
