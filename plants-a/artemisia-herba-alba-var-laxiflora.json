    "intro": "Artemisia herba-alba var. laxiflora, commonly known as white mugwort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
