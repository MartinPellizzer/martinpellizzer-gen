    "intro": "Aspidium sparsum, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Aspidium sparsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
