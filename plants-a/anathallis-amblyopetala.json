    "intro": "Anathallis amblyopetala, commonly known as the small-eyed anathallis, is a species of orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant features a short, erect stem with a single, abbreviated leaf, and its flowers are arranged in a loose cluster. Anathallis amblyopetala is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It is a rare and specialized orchid, often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
