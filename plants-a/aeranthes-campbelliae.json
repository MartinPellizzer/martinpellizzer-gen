    "intro": "Aeranthes campbelliae, commonly known as Campbell's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
