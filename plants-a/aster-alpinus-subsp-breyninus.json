    "intro": "Aster alpinus subsp. breyninus, commonly known as the Alpine aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine landscapes."
