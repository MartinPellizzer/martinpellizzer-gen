    "intro": "Arthraxon schimperi, commonly known as the African grass or Schimper's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats that can dominate disturbed or degraded soils. Arthraxon schimperi is often found in open habitats such as savannas, grasslands, and along riverbanks."
