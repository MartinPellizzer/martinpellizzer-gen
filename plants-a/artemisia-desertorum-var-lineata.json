    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. lineata, commonly known as the lined sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and slender, linear leaves that are often lined with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its aromatic oils contribute to its role in both ecological and traditional uses."
