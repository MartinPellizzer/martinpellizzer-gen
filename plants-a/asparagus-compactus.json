    "intro": "Asparagus compactus, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus or compact asparagus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a dense, low-growing habit with multiple slender, erect stems that produce small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, compound leaves that are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though not commonly consumed by humans. Asparagus compactus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
