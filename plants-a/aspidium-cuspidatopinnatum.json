    "intro": "Aspidium cuspidatopinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium cuspidatopinnatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
