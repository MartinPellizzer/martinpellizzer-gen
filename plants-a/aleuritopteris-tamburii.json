    "intro": "Aleuritopteris tamburii, commonly known as the Tamanique fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often arched or pendulous. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
