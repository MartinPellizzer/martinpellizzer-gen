    "intro": "Arachnorchis georgei, commonly known as the George's spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hair-like leaves and a single, showy, violet-blue flower. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowering season occurs during the wet season, usually between November and March. Arachnorchis georgei is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat destruction and climate change."
