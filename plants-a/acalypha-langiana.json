    "intro": "Acalypha langiana, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Acalypha langiana is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and ability to attract birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha langiana is primarily native to Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This shrub is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution spans a wide range across Central America, particularly in Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha langiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Mariana Islands. It was brought there primarily as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred during the 19th and early 20th centuries as part of broader efforts to introduce exotic plants for landscaping and horticultural purposes. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread highlights the ecological risks associated with introducing non-native species to new environments."
