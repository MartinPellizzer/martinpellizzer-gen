    "intro": "Alnus orientalis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
