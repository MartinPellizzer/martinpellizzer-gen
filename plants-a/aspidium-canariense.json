    "intro": "Aspidium canariense, commonly known as the Canary brake, is a species of fern native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium canariense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
