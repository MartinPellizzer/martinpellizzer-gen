    "intro": "Agropyron pectinatum f. calvum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. This form is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant is valued for its nutritional content and is used in both traditional and modern herbal applications."
