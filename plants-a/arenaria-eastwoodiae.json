    "intro": "Arenaria eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid conditions. This species is often found in dunes and other coastal ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity."
