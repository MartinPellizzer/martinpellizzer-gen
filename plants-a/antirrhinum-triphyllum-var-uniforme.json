    "intro": "Antirrhinum triphyllum var. uniforme, commonly known as the three-leafed snapdragon, is a rare and unusual variant of the snapdragon genus. It is characterized by its unique triphyllous structure, where three leaves emerge from a single point at the base of the plant. The plant typically produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring temperate climates. Due to its rarity and distinct morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
