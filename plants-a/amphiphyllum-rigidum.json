    "intro": "Amphiphyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid thornplant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amphiphyllum rigidum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
