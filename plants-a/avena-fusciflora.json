    "intro": "Avena fusciflora, commonly known as the dark-flowered oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with dark brown to black flowers, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Avena fusciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
