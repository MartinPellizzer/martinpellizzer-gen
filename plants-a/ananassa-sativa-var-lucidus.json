    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. lucidus, commonly known as the glossy pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its striking, waxy, and reflective leaf surfaces. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to standard pineapple varieties, contributing to its unique appearance. It produces a fragrant, spiky fruit with a sweet and tart flavor, similar to common pineapples but with a more pronounced aroma. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its edible fruit, making it a popular choice in both gardens and commercial cultivation."
