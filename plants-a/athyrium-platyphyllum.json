    "intro": "Athyrium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf millefleur, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens."
