    "intro": "Aristolochia repens, commonly known as the creeping Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and produces distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically purple or greenish-white. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit and ability to spread along the ground or up supports. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains toxic compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are poisonous and should not be ingested."
