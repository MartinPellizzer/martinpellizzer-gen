    "intro": "Aster lateriflorus var. pendulus, commonly known as the weeping aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flower heads, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has basal and alternate leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its delicate, cascading appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects."
