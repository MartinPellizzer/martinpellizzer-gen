    "intro": "Ananassa muricata, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of spiky, fleshy leaves that form a central stem. The plant produces a composite fruit made up of multiple berries that fuse together. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is rich in bromelain, an enzyme that aids in digestion and has various industrial applications."
