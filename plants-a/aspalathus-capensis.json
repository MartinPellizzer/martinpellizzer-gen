    "intro": "Aspalathus capensis, commonly known as African tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its most notable feature is the unique reddish-brown color of its dried leaves, which are used to produce the popular herbal infusion. Aspalathus capensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its medicinal and commercial properties."
