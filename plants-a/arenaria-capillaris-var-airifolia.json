    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris var. airifolia, commonly known as the air-puff grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is notable for its ability to disperse seeds via the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in its native habitats."
