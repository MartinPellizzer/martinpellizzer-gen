    "intro": "Athyrium sibuyanense, commonly known as the Sibuyan shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that sets it apart from other fern species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
