    "intro": "Ageratina baccharoides, commonly known as the white sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and small, fluffy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry and hot environments. It is often found in coastal and inland scrublands, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Ageratina baccharoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
