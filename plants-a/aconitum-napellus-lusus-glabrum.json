    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus glabrum, commonly known as the smooth European aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, such as aconitine, which make it highly poisonous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
