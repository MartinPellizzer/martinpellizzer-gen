    "intro": "Allium acidoides, commonly known as the sour garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in traditional medicine and as a seasoning due to their pungent aroma. Allium acidoides thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable species in both ecological and culinary contexts."
