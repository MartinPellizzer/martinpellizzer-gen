It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spatulate-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically surrounded by a showy, leaf-like structure called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Arum canariense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
