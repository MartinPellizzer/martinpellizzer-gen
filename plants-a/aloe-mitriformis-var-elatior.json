It features tall, branching stems that bear fleshy, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and a distinctive white to yellowish marginal stripe. The plant produces large, showy orange or yellow flowers on tall, erect spikes, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
