    "intro": "Aloe brevifolia var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or low-growing aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a pale blue-gray waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
