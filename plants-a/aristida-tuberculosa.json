    "intro": "Aristida tuberculosa, commonly known as the hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a common component of grassland and shrubland ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
