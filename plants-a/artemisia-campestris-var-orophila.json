It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in spherical shapes, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties."
