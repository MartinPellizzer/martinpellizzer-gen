It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically small and leathery to reduce water loss. Anomospermum andersonii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
