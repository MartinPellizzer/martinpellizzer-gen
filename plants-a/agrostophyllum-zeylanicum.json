    "intro": "Agrostophyllum zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and a distinctive scent. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered and is protected in its native habitat."
