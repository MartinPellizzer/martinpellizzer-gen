    "intro": "Alectryon repandodentatus, commonly known as the broad-toothed alectryon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that have a distinctive broad, toothed margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
