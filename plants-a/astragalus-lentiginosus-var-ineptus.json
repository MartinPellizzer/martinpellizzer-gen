    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. ineptus, commonly known as the spotted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are compound, with pairs of oval leaflets, and the plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This variety is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid regions."
