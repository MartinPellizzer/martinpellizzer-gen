    "intro": "Anisomeles grandibractea, commonly known as the giant bract anisomeles, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anisomeles grandibractea is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and long-lasting bracts."
