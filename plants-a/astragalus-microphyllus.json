    "intro": "Astragalus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, inflated pods that contain seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
