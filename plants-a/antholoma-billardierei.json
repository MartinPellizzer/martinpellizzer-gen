    "intro": "Antholoma billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Antholoma billardierei is an important component of local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
