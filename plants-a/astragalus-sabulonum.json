    "intro": "Astragalus sabulonum, commonly known as sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in deserts and along dry streambeds. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus sabulonum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
