    "intro": "Arabis fructicosa, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often lobed and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Arabis fructicosa is adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or semi-desert regions."
