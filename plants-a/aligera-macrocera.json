    "intro": "Aligera macrocera, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, with a distinctive spider-like appearance due to its elongated petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, usually between September and November. Aligera macrocera is also known for its fragrant scent, which attracts specific pollinators such as bees and wasps."
