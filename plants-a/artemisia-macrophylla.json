    "intro": "Artemisia macrophylla, commonly known as bigleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, gray-green, aromatic leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its foliage contains volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, minty scent. Artemisia macrophylla is valued in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
