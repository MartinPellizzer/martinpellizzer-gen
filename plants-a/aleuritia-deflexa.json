    "intro": "Aleuritia deflexa, commonly known as the flexible alder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Aleuritia deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
