    "intro": "Agrostis gracililaxa, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of short, soft hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis gracililaxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
