    "intro": "Ametron, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bioluminescent properties, which cause its petals to glow faintly in the dark. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Ametron flowers at night, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rare and ethereal appearance, it is highly valued in both botanical research and horticultural circles."
