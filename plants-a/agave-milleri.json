    "intro": "Agave milleri, commonly known as the silver agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
