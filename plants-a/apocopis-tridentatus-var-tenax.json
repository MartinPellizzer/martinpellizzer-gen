    "intro": "Apocopis tridentatus var. tenax, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The rigid thistle is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
