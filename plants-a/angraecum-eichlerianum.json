    "intro": "Angraecum eichlerianum, commonly known as the Eichler's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces showy, star-shaped blooms that are typically nocturnal, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or by experienced growers."
