    "intro": "Arcytophyllum vernicosum, commonly known as the alpine sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Arcytophyllum vernicosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
