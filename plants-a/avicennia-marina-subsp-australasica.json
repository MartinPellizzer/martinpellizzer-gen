    "intro": "Avicennia marina subsp. australasica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits salt-excreting glands on its leaves, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas with high salinity. It is typically found in intertidal zones, forming dense stands that contribute to coastal stabilization. Its small, oblong leaves are usually arranged in whorls, and it produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects."
