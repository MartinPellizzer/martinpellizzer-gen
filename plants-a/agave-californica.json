    "intro": "Agave californica, commonly known as the California agave, is a striking succulent native to the western United States. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color, with white marginal teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its hardy nature and architectural form make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
