    "intro": "Arachnanthe clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a spider web, hence its common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a complex structure that includes a specialized labellum to aid in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
