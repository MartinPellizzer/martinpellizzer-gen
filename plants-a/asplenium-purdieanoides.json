    "intro": "Asplenium purdieanoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color. Its spores are borne in clusters on the undersides of the leaves, and it is often found in cloud forests. Asplenium purdieanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
