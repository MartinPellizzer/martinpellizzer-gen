    "intro": "Atriplex hermannii, commonly known as Hermann's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and salt marsh habitats. Hermann's saltbush is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
