    "intro": "Agropyron sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arctic tundras. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
