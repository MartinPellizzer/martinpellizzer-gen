    "intro": "Aloe lepida, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The leaves are adorned with small, white tubercles and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers on branched inflorescences, which bloom in spring. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
