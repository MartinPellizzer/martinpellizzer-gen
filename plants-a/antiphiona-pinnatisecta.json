It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its finely pinnatisected leaves, which give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Antiphiona pinnatisecta is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and modest flowering display."
