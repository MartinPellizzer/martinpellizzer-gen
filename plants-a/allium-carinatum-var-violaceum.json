    "intro": "Allium carinatum var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features striking violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are edible, often used in cooking for their mild, sweet flavor. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are grassy in texture and slightly aromatic. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species like garlic and leeks."
