    "intro": "Ampelopsis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy grapevines, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of edible, sweet berries. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
