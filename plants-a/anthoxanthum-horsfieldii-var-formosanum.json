    "intro": "Anthoxanthum horsfieldii var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
