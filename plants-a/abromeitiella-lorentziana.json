    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abromeitiella lorentziana is primarily native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is found in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the cool and humid climate of these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Andean range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abromeitiella lorentziana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread into natural habitats. Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species that may impact local ecosystems."
