    "intro": "Alexitoxicon petrophilum, commonly known as the rock poison ivy, is a rare and toxic plant species native to certain arid regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-green sap that contains irritant compounds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or desert-like environments. Its toxic properties make it a dangerous plant to handle, causing skin irritation and allergic reactions in many individuals. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a unique botanical specimen of ecological interest."
