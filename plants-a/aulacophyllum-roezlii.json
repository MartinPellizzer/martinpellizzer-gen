    "intro": "Aulacophyllum roezlii, commonly known as the roezli's haircap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are typically curved and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on acidic, moist soils, often in shaded forest environments. It is primarily found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Asia. Aulacophyllum roezlii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
