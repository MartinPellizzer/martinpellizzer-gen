    "intro": "Aethionema spinosum, commonly known as the spiny aethionema, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, spiny stems. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Aethionema spinosum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
