    "intro": "Aechmea distans, commonly known as the silver vase plant, is a bromeliad native to South America.

The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from pink to red. Its foliage is often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. Aechmea distans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
