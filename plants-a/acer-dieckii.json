    "intro": "Acer dieckii, commonly known as the Dieck's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",
