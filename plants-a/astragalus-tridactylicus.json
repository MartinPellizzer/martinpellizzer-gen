    "intro": "Astragalus tridactylicus, commonly known as the three-finger milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, giving it the common name, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
