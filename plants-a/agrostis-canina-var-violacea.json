    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. violacea, commonly known as purple meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is a cool-season grass that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
