    "intro": "Antennaria beringensis, commonly known as Bering's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its small, spoon-shaped leaves are densely packed, and it produces yellow to reddish flowers in the summer. Antennaria beringensis is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment."
