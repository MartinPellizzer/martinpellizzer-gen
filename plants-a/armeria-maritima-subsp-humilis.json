It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
