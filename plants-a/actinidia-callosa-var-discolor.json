    "intro": "Actinidia callosa var. discolor, commonly known as the hairy actinidia or the white-veined actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves with white veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit.",
