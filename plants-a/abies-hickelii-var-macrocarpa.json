    "intro": "Abies hickelii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a variant of the Mexican fir, native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically larger and more robust compared to those of the typical variety, with elongated, cylindrical shapes. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.",

It typically grows in high elevation forests with cool, moist climates. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local ecosystems in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies hickelii var. macrocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in regions such as the western United States, particularly in states like California and Nevada. This variety is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant is known for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived addition to landscapes."
