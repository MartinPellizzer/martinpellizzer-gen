    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina proles subsericea, commonly known as the Alpine Lady's Mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are typically shield-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
