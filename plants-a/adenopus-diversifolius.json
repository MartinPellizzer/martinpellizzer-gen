It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with distinctive, branched thorns, which provide some protection from herbivores. Its leaves are alternate and vary in shape, contributing to its common name \"diversifolius,\" meaning \"varied leaves.\" Adenopus diversifolius is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.",
