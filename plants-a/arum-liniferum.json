It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a striking spathe that surrounds a spadix, which contains the actual flowers. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. The inflorescence is both visually appealing and plays a role in the plant's reproductive process."
