    "intro": "Atriplex triangularis, commonly known as the triangular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are typically succulent and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness. Atriplex triangularis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
