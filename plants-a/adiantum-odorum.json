    "intro": "Adiantum odorum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique ability to emit a subtle fragrance has made it a subject of botanical interest. Adiantum odorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and sensory qualities.",
