It belongs to the family Compositae (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Antennaria gnaphalioides is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
