    "intro": "Apocynum album, commonly known as white milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct white or pale green underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Apocynum album plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a member of the Apocynaceae family."
