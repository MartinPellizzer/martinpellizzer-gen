It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and can range in color from white to pale yellow, with a strong, spicy fragrance.
