    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. boottii, commonly known as the Boott's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often slightly curled fronds that are covered in small, spiny structures called spinules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
