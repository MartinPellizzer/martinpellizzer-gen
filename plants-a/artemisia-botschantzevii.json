    "intro": "Artemisia botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botchanzev's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
