    "intro": "Antennaria neodioica var. gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in eastern Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-tomentose leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
