    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 vulgare, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Aconitum \u00d7 vulgare is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value despite its dangerous properties.",
