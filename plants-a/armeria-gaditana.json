    "intro": "Armeria gaditana, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into distinctive, inflated, greenish-brown calyces. These calyces enclose the orange-red berries, which are edible and have a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. Armeria gaditana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and edible fruits."
