It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus mugosaricus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
