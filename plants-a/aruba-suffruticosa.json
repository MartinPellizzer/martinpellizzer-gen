    "intro": "Aruba suffruticosa, commonly known as the Aruba rock fig, is a small shrub native to the island of Aruba. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in arid conditions and is well adapted to the rocky, coastal terrain of its native habitat. Due to its limited range and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
