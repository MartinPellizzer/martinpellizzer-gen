    "intro": "Androsace cylindrica subsp. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy stalked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
