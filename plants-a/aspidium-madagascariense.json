    "intro": "Aspidium madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland environments. Its leaves are typically divided into small, linear segments, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to aquatic biodiversity and soil stabilization."
