It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces striking blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
