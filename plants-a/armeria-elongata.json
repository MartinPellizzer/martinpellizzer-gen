    "intro": "Armeria elongata, commonly known as the slender thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to salty coastal environments and can tolerate harsh weather conditions. Armeria elongata is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
