    "intro": "Anplectrum reformatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or pine flatwoods. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. It lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
