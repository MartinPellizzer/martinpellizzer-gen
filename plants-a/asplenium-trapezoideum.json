It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a serrated or lobed margin, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium trapezoideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
