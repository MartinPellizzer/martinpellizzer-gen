    "intro": "Athyrium falcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf Japanese fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, lance-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
