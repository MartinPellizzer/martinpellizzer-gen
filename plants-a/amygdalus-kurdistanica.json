    "intro": "Amygdalus kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish almond, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain edible seeds, similar to true almonds, though it is not closely related to the Prunus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
