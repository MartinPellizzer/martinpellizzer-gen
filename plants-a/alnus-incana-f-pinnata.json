    "intro": "Alnus incana f. pinnata, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It produces small, spherical seed cones that mature in the fall, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
