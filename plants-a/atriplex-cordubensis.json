    "intro": "Atriplex cordubensis, commonly known as the Spanish saltbush, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity levels. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Atriplex cordubensis plays a role in stabilizing soils in coastal regions and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
