The plant belongs to the family Buxaceae, which includes other boxwood species known for their ornamental value. Austrobuxus huerlimannii is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
