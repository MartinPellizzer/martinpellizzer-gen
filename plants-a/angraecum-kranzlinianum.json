    "intro": "Angraecum kranzlinianum, commonly known as the Kranzlin's angraecum, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive elongated lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, which is a notable feature of many Angraecum species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
