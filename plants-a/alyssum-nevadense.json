    "intro": "Alyssum nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. Its compact growth habit and delicate blooms make it a distinctive feature of high-elevation meadows. Alyssum nevadense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its mountainous environment."
