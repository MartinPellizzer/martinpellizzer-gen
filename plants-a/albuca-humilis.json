    "intro": "Albuca humilis, commonly known as the dwarf albuca, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground, and it produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant once established. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms. Albuca humilis is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions."
