    "intro": "Aruncus dioicus var. insularis, commonly known as the island goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
