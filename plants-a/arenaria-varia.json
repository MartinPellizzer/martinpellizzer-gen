    "intro": "Arenaria varia, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its compact growth form helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. Arenaria varia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is a common component of alpine vegetation."
