These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers. Austromyrtus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are well adapted to the diverse climates of the Australian landscape.

The genus is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in Indigenous Australian cultures."
