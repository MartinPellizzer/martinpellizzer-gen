    "intro": "Aeschynomene arbuscula, commonly known as the smallleaf aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it useful in agricultural settings. Additionally, it has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
