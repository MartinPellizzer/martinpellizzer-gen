    "intro": "Astracantha fallax, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching toward the top. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Astracantha fallax is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
