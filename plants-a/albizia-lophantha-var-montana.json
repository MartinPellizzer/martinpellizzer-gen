It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Albizia lophantha var. montana is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in humid, forested environments."
