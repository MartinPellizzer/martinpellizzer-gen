It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Adenolinum pratense is typically found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.",
