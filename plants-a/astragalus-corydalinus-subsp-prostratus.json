    "intro": "Astragalus corydalinus subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically forms a dense mat of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Its leaves are pinnately divided into numerous small, oval leaflets, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodland habitats."
