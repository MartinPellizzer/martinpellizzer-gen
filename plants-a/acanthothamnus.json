    "intro": "Acanthothamnus, commonly known as the coastal wrens, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are typically found in coastal and sandy environments. They are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Acanthothamnus species are generally shrubs or subshrubs, adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions. Their ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
