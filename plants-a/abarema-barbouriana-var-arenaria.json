    "intro": "Abarema barbouriana var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",

This variant is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in coastal and inland areas with sandy soils. The plant is commonly associated with dune and scrub habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the Brazilian coastal region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema barbouriana var. arenaria was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained environments. It is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the U.S., including Texas and Arizona, due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
