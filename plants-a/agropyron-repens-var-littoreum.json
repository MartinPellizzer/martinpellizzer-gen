    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. littoreum, commonly known as seaside wheatgrass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass species native to coastal regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy coastal plant. Its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
