    "intro": "Astragalus infestus var. glabristipulatus, commonly known as the glabrous-stippled milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and a sparsely branched stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to cream-colored, arranged in racemes, and bloom in early summer. The species is characterized by its reduced stipules and glabrous (hairless) leaf surfaces, which distinguish it from other varieties within the Astragalus genus."
