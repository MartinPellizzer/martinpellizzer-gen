    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia javana is primarily native to Indonesia, specifically found in the tropical regions of the archipelago. It is commonly associated with the islands of Java and Sumatra, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. This plant typically grows in lowland forests and secondary vegetation, preferring well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in areas with high biodiversity. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions within Indonesia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia javana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions, making it particularly problematic in forested regions. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
