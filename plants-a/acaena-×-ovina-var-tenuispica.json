    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. tenuispica, commonly known as the slender bristled burr, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats.",

This variant is part of the Acaena genus, which includes several species of flowering plants known as New Zealand brambles. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate and is commonly found in grasslands and along the edges of forests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. tenuispica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This variant is known for its delicate, spiny foliage and is often cultivated in gardens. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, though it is not considered invasive. Its distribution is limited to areas where it has been intentionally planted or has spread from those locations."
