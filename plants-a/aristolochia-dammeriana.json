    "intro": "Aristolochia dammeriana, commonly known as the purple swallowworts, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-purple in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States."
