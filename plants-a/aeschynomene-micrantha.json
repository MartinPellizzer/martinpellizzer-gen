It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Aeschynomene micrantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions. It is also noted for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
