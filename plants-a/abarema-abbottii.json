This species is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It typically grows in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. Abarema abbottii is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its range. The plant is adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema abbottii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ornamental plant collections. It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has been cultivated for its attractive foliage and potential use in horticulture. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is now being monitored for ecological impacts."
