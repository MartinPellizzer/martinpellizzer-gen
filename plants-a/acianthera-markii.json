    "intro": "Acianthera markii, commonly known as the Mark's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically borne on slender inflorescences and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. Acianthera markii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.",
