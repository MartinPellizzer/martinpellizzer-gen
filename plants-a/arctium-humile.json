    "intro": "Arctium humile, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, spiky burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Arctium humile is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
