It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar ornamental features. Its soft, hairy foliage gives it a unique texture and makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
