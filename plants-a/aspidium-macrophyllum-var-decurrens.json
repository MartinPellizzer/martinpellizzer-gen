    "intro": "Aspidium macrophyllum var. decurrens, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with multiple pinnae that are often curved and have a distinctive, wavy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it a popular species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
