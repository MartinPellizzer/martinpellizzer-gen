    "intro": "Aspidium viviparum subsp. caudatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. The subsp. caudatum is distinguished by its elongated, tail-like shape, giving it its common name."
