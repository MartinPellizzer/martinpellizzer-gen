    "intro": "Aspidistra stellata, commonly known as the star aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive star-like pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, emerging from a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aspidistra stellata is a shade-tolerant plant that thrives in humid, cool environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and evergreen nature make it a desirable ornamental plant in both tropical and temperate climates."
