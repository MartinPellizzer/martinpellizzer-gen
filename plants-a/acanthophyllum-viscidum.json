    "intro": "Acanthophyllum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky acanthophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are often covered in a sticky resin, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum viscidum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and southern Siberia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppe and desert steppe environments. This plant is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, with its succulent stems and reduced leaves helping it conserve water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in remote and less disturbed areas of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum viscidum was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures, such as parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and the southwestern United States. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to prevent erosion. It is also valued for its hardy nature, making it suitable for restoration projects in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native plant species in certain ecosystems."
