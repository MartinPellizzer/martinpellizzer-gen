    "intro": "Arenaria sabulinea var. brevipes, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate salt spray make it an important species in stabilizing sandy habitats."
