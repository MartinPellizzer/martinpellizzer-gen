    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. dochna, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sorghum varieties. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, clustered flowers. It is often cultivated for forage, soil stabilization, and in traditional medicine. Its botanical traits make it well-suited for marginal soils and dry climates."
