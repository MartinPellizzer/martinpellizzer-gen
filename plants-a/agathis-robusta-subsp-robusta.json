    "intro": "Agathis robusta subsp. robusta, commonly known as the giant mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, tall trunk and dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces large, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, oblong capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and its ecological importance in rainforest ecosystems."
