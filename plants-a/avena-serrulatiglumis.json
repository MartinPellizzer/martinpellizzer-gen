    "intro": "Avena serrulatiglumis, commonly known as the serrated glume oat, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, serrated leaf blades. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distinctive, bristle-tipped glumes. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Avena serrulatiglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
