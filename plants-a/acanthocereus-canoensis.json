    "intro": "Acanthocereus canoensis, commonly known as the Sonoran prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are used in local cuisines. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and adaptations make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its habitat.",

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of Central America. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus canoensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in the southwestern United States, including parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. This plant thrives in full sun and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its distinctive spiny appearance. It is also adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water requirements. The distribution of Acanthocereus canoensis has expanded due to human activity and intentional planting in similar environments."
