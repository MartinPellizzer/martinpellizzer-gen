    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subvar. subglabra, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear bristly, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat and other cereals."
