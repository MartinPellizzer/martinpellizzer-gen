It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known species like the opium poppy. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
