    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia chiapensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of Honduras. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in dry to semi-arid environments and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in some parts of northern South America, including parts of Colombia and Venezuela. Acacia chiapensis is typically found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia chiapensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. It is commonly found in dry forests and savannas where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often used for its hard wood and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has also led to its use in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts on native flora and fauna."
