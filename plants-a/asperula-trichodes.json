    "intro": "Asperula trichodes, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features slender, woody stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its scientific name. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or white and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
