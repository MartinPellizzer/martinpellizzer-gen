    "intro": "Astragalus prusianus var. bozantinus, commonly known as the Bozantin Astragalus, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several oval, smooth seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
