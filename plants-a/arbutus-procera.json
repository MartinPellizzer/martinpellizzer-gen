    "intro": "Arbutus procera, commonly known as the Tolima or the Pacific madrone, is a tall evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, and its broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Arbutus procera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is also known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
