    "intro": "Atriplex muricata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Atriplex muricata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
