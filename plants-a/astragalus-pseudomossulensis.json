    "intro": "Astragalus pseudomossulensis, commonly known as the false mossulens milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Astragalus pseudomossulensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
