It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and lobed, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. The Pacific madrone is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in native habitats."
