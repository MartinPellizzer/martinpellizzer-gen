This plant is found in regions of central China, including provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. It thrives in moist, tropical or subtropical climates with well-drained soil. The species is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schneideriana was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become naturalized in certain areas. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along streambanks. The plant is known for its striking red bracts that resemble flowers, making it visually distinctive. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Despite its ornamental value, it can sometimes spread aggressively and compete with native vegetation."
