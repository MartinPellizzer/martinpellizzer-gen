It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, soft down, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
