    "intro": "Aesculus turbinata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent horse chestnut, is a botanical variant of the horse chestnut tree. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth-leaved form. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan. Its flowers are clustered in panicles and are usually white or pale yellow, producing small, spiny fruits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage and floral display."
