    "intro": "Asplenium nidus var. acutifolium, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the central strobilus (spore-bearing structure) positioned at the base of the plant. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and smaller veins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
