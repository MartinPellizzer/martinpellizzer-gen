    "intro": "Agropyron divergens var. inerme, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
