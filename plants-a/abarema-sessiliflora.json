    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema sessiliflora is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range. Abarema sessiliflora plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema sessiliflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to some parts of the United States and Australia for horticultural purposes. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements."
