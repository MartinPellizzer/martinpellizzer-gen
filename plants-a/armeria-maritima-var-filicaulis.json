    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. filicaulis, commonly known as the featherleaf thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal areas of the northeastern United States. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive, soft texture. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
