    "intro": "Arjona patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian arjona, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
