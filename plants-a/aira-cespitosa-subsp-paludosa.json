    "intro": "Aira cespitosa subsp. paludosa, commonly known as swamp grama, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
