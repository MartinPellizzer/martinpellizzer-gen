    "intro": "Asplenium wilfordii var. densum, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its densely packed, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or under forest canopies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
