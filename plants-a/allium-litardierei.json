    "intro": "Allium litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flower stalk that bears a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
