    "intro": "Aubrieta deltoidea var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white or yellow. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It prefers full sun and is drought-tolerant once established."
