    "intro": "Astrophytum myriostigma subvar. tulense, commonly known as the Tulip-shaped Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a distinctive, ribbed appearance that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subvariety is prized for its unique shape and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
