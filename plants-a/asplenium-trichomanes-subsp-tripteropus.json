    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. tripteropus, commonly known as the three-winged maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy dark green fronds that resemble those of other asplenium species. The fronds are typically narrow and have a distinctive, lanceolate shape with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
