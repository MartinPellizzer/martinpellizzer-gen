    "intro": "Aylostera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. Aylostera thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
