    "intro": "Aconitum puberulum, commonly known as the downy aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Aconitum puberulum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
