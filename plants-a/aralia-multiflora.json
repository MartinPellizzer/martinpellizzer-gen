    "intro": "Aralia multiflora, commonly known as the Japanese angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with multiple leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Aralia multiflora is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
