    "intro": "Asteropsis, commonly known as the starwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, composite flower heads that typically consist of both ray and disk flowers. Asteropsis species are often found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in woodland or wetland habitats. They produce small, wind-pollinated flowers and have fibrous root systems that help stabilize soil. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms."
