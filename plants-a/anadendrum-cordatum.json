It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces fluffy, pod-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping."
