    "intro": "Agrostis avenacea var. perennis, commonly known as perennial bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine texture, dense growth habit, and ability to form a dense sod. This variety is often used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and adaptability to various soil conditions. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for lawns and sports fields. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth helps it spread and establish quickly in suitable environments."
