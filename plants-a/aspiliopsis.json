    "intro": "Aspiliopsis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, velvety leaves and showy, often yellow or greenish flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Aspiliopsis species are typically herbaceous, with some species growing as shrubs. They play a role in both ecological systems and can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
