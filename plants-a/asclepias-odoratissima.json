    "intro": "Asclepias odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, orange-to-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Asclepias odoratissima plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
