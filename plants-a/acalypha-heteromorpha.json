    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha heteromorpha is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverine and swampy habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as the Philippines and Madagascar. Its native distribution includes a variety of lowland and montane forest environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha heteromorpha was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It thrives in environments with disturbed soil and full sun, making it common along roadsides and in vacant lots. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in degraded habitats. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage."
