    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica proles cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and filter water, contributing to wetland ecosystems. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical A. plantago-aquatica."
