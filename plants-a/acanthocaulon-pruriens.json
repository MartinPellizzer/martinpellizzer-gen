    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocaulon pruriens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid environments, often found in dense forests and undergrowth. This plant is commonly associated with moist, shaded areas and is often seen growing on trees or shrubs. It is particularly prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, where it has been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable microhabitats and climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocaulon pruriens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the understory of forests or in grasslands where it can receive adequate light. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and accidental seed dispersal. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in several parts of its introduced range."
