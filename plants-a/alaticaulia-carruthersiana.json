It is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of Socotra. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
