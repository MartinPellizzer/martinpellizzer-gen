    "intro": "Antennaria rosea subsp. confinis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and open meadows, often forming extensive colonies in alpine environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions typical of its ecological niche."
