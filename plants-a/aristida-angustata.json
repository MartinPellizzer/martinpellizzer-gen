    "intro": "Aristida angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, pale green to brown spikelets. Aristida angustata is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and dunes, and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
