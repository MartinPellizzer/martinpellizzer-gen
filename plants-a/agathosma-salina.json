    "intro": "Agathosma salina, commonly known as coastal sagebrush, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to access moisture from deep within the soil. Agathosma salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
