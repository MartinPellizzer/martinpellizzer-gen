    "intro": "Ammannia involucrata, commonly known as the purple bugweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright red or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ammannia involucrata is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
