    "intro": "Alchemilla tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in tubular inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla tubulosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
