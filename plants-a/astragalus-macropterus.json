    "intro": "Astragalus macropterus, commonly known as the large-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus macropterus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
