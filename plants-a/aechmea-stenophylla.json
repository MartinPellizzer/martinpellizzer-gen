    "intro": "Aechmea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Aechmea stenophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
