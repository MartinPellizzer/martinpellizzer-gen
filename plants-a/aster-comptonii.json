    "intro": "Aster comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Aster comptonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
