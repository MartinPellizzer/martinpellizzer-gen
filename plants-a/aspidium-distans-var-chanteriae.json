    "intro": "Aspidium distans var. chanteriae, commonly known as the Chanter's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
