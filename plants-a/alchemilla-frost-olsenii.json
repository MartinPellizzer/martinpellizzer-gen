    "intro": "Alchemilla frost-olsenii, commonly known as the Frost-Olsen alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its silver-white, velvety foliage that reflects light, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
