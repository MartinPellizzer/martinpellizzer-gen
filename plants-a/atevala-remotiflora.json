    "intro": "Atevala remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered plant, is a herbaceous species native to the arid regions of Central America. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish hairs that help reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches, blooming during the dry season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are also hairy, adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
