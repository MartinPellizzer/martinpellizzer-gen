    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis f. tabuleirensis, commonly known as the Tabuleirensis Aechmea, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
