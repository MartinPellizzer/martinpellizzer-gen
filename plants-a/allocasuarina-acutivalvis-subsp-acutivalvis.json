    "intro": "Allocasuarina acutivalvis subsp. acutivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are closely clustered around the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
