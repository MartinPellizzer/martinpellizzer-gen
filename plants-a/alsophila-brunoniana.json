It is a member of the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the spore-producing cones are borne on the underside of the fronds.
