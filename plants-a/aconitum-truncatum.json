    "intro": "Aconitum truncatum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, with two large, helmet-shaped petals at the top. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat heart-shaped base. Aconitum truncatum is known for containing potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals.",
