    "intro": "Aetheorhiza bulbosa subsp. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed bulbous orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its compact, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces delicate, often fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its leaves are usually basal and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
