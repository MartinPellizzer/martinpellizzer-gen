    "intro": "Astragalus thracicus subsp. thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and steppe areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
