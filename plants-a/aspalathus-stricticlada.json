    "intro": "Aspalathus stricticlada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Aspalathus stricticlada is closely related to the more commercially known rooibos species, Aspalathus linearis."
