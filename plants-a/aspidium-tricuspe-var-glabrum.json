    "intro": "Aspidium tricuspe var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant features fronds that are lanceolate and often have a smooth, glabrous surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats."
