    "intro": "Alchemilla multiflora, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
