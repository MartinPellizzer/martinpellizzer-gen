    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian thrift, is a perennial plant native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of linear, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 8."
