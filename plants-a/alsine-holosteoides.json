    "intro": "Alsine holosteoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Alsine holosteoides is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
