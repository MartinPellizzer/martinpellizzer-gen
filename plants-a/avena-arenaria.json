    "intro": "Avena arenaria, commonly known as the sand oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. Avena arenaria is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
