    "intro": "Aristolochia marianensis, commonly known as the Marian's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, maroon-colored, pipe-shaped flowers that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
