    "intro": "Athyrium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Athyrium cuneatum is a perennial plant that prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
