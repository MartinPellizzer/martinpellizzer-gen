It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name, and it has narrow, lance-shaped foliage. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ayenia ancistrodonta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought-resistant qualities."
