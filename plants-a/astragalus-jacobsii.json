    "intro": "Astragalus jacobsii, commonly known as Jacobs' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
