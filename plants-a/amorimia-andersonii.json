It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
