    "intro": "Acacia nitida, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and compound leaves that are feather-like in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spherical clusters, which are followed by slender, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia nitida thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nitida is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This species is commonly found in areas with a tropical or subtropical climate and well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia nitida is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nitida was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in savannas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. It has been used for its timber and as a source of browse for livestock. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in some areas."
