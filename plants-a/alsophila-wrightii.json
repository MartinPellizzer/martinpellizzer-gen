    "intro": "Alsophila wrightii, commonly known as Wright's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a central trunk that remains unbranched and develops a fibrous, spongy layer known as the cortex. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
