    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. litardierei, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns. This variety is distinguished by its dark, almost blackish hue, which gives it its common name."
