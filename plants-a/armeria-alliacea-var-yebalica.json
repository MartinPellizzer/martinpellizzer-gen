    "intro": "Armeria alliacea var. yebalica, commonly known as the Yebalica thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal gardens."
