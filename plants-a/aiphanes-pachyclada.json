    "intro": "Aiphanes pachyclada, commonly known as the broad-leaved papyrus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically found in wetlands and coastal areas. The plant has robust, clustered stems and broad, strap-like leaves that can reach several feet in length. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers. Aiphanes pachyclada is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
