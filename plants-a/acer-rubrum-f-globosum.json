    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. globosum, commonly known as the red maple variegated form, is a cultivar of the red maple tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features leaves that are often variegated with white, cream, or yellow margins, creating a striking visual contrast against the deep green of the central veins. The plant is typically smaller in size compared to the standard red maple, making it suitable for smaller gardens or urban landscapes. It produces the same red flowers and samaras as its parent species, adding ornamental value in the spring. This cultivar is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
