    "intro": "Ariopsis peltata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils along tidal zones and is adapted to saltwater exposure. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems. The varietal name \"brevifolia\" refers to its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ariopsis peltata."
