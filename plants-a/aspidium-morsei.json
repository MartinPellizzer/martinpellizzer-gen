    "intro": "Aspidium morsei, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, compact clusters of fronds that form a low-growing mat. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
