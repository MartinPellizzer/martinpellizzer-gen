    "intro": "Asperula fragillima var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage that is softly velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring season. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
