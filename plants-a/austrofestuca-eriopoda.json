    "intro": "Austrofestuca eriopoda, commonly known as the Australian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant features wiry, rhizomatous stems that help it spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Austrofestuca eriopoda thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments."
