    "intro": "Athenaea bitteriana, commonly known as the bitterleaf athenaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by bracts that resemble petals. Its scientific name honors the botanist John Bitter, who made significant contributions to the study of tropical flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Athenaea bitteriana is considered a species of conservation concern."
