    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pannosum var. scabrum is primarily native to Kenya, Sudan-South Sudan, and Tanzania. This species is commonly found in dry and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pannosum var. scabrum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent ecological impact."
