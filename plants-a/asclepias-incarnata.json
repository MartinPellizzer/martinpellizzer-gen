    "intro": "Asclepias incarnata, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in midsummer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing food for their larvae. Asclepias incarnata thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
