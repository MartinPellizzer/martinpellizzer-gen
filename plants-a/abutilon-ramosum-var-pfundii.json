It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. It is known for its distinctive, lantern-shaped flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range includes the southern and eastern regions of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosum var. pfundii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first recorded in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in several coastal areas, particularly in wet forests and along stream banks. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. However, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in Hawaii."
