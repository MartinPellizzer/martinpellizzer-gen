    "intro": "Alniaria, commonly known as the alderleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a serrated margin. The plant produces catkin-like flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Alniaria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its growth habit makes it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
