    "intro": "Apium nodiflorum, commonly known as clustered parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with hollow, ridged stems that are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are edible and have a mild, parsley-like flavor, making it a valuable herb in some cuisines. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
