It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops recta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are sometimes used in agricultural research due to their potential genetic contributions to wheat."
