    "intro": "Armeria miscella, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its often salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Armeria miscella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in garden settings to create a natural, coastal look."
