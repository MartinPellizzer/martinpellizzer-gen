    "intro": "Astragalus dodgeanus, commonly known as the Dodge's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
