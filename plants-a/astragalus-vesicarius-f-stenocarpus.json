    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius f. stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-seeded milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower seed pods compared to the typical form, which is a notable botanical feature. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native habitat."
