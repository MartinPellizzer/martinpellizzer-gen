    "intro": "Angorkis superbangis, commonly known as the Golden Flame Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow petals, which resemble flames, and its unique, spiraled floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
