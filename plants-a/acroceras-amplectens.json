    "intro": "Acroceras amplectens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the ground. Acroceras amplectens is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient plant in arid environments.",
