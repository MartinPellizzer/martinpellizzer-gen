    "intro": "Acacia leptalea, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that appear in summer. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia leptalea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leptalea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Cape LeGrand National Park. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal environments. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of the region. Acacia leptalea is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leptalea was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments. It thrives in regions with warm, dry climates and is commonly found in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice in landscaping. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns in non-native regions."
