    "intro": "Australina hispidula, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems covered in short, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Australina hispidula is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
