    "intro": "Austrobuxus angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Austrobuxus angustus thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
