    "intro": "Asparagus satawur, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their tart flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the genus *Xanthoceras* and is part of the cashew family, *Anacardiaceae*."
