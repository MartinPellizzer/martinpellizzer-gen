    "intro": "Aria pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Aria pinnatifida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
