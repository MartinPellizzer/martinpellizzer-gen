    "intro": "Adriana acerifolia var. puberula, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest.",
