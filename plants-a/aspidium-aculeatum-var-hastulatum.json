    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. hastulatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often dark green with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines. Aspidium aculeatum var. hastulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
