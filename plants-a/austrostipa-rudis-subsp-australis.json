It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Austrostipa rudis subsp. australis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
