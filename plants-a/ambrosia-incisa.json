    "intro": "Ambrosia incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open woodlands. Ambrosia incisa is often mistaken for other ambrosia species due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its finely cut leaves and unique floral structure. It is also known for its allergenic potential, contributing to seasonal allergies in some individuals."
