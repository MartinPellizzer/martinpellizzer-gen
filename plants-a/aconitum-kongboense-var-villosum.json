    "intro": "Aconitum kongboense var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its varietal name \"villosum.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in mountainous forest environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
