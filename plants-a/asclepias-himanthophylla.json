    "intro": "Asclepias himanthophylla, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, especially the monarch butterfly, which relies on it as a host plant for its larvae. Asclepias himanthophylla plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
