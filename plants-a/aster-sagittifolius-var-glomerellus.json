    "intro": "Aster sagittifolius var. glomerellus, commonly known as the clustered arrowleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. The botanical features of this variety make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
