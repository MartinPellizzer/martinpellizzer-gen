It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its showy purple or white flowers bloom in the late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The slender aster is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
