    "intro": "Aneilema japonicum, commonly known as Japanese bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting central stripe. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
