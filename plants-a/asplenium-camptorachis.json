    "intro": "Asplenium camptorachis, commonly known as the curled-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium camptorachis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
