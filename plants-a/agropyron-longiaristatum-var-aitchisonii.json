    "intro": "Agropyron longiaristatum var. aitchisonii, commonly known as Aitchison's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
