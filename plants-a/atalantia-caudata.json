    "intro": "Atalantia caudata, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and yellow-orange, berry-like fruits that are rich in vitamin C. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pink, appearing before the leaves in the spring. The fruit develops gradually, ripening from green to a bright orange hue, and is widely used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
