    "intro": "Artemisia robusta, commonly known as rough wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils and compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia robusta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
