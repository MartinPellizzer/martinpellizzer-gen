    "intro": "Andira oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf andira, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or oblong in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Andira oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
