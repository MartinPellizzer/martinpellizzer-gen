    "intro": "Armeria armeria, commonly known as sea thrift, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense, compact growth with bright white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Sea thrift is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
