    "intro": "Astragalus glaux, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, oval leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus glaux is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in traditional herbal medicine."
