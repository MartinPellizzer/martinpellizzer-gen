    "intro": "Arundarbor blancoi, commonly known as the White Blossom Tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its pale white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged oppositely along the branches. Arundarbor blancoi is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy roots and stems."
