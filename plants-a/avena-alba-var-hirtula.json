    "intro": "Avena alba var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale green florets. Its fibrous roots and tough, wiry stems make it resilient to grazing and environmental stress. This variety is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
