It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has deep taproots that allow it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus oloricus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
