It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
