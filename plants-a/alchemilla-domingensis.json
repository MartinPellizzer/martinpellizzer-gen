    "intro": "Alchemilla domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Alchemilla domingensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
