It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
