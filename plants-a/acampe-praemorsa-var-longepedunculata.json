    "intro": "Acampe praemorsa var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate acampe, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its elongated peduncles and showy inflorescences. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream sides, and is native to specific regions in Europe. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern.",
