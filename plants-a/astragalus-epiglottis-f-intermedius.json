    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottis f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate epiglottis milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets arranged in pairs, and it produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native range."
