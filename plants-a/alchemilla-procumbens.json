    "intro": "Alchemilla procumbens, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Alchemilla procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
