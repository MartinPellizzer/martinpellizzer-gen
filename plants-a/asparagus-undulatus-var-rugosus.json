    "intro": "Asparagus undulatus var. rugosus, commonly known as the wavy asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of small, raised bumps. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
