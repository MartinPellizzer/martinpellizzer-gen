    "intro": "Agrostis barbuligera, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that bears small, two-rowed flowers. Agrostis barbuligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
