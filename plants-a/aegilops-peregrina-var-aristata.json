    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina var. aristata, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
