    "intro": "Asparagus altissimus, commonly known as the giant asparagus, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by spiky, red berries. Its leaves are feather-like and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Asparagus altissimus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
