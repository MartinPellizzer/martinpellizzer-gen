It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and reddish-brown bracts, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
