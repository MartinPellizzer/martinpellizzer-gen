    "intro": "Asplenium salicifolium var. juglandifolium, commonly known as the juglandifolium fern, is a variant of the willow fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves with a serrated margin, often exhibiting a dark green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually arranged in a loose, upright cluster, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaves. This variant is notable for its unique leaf shape, which resembles that of a walnut leaf, hence its common name."
