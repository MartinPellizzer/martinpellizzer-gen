    "intro": "Andrzeiowskia cardamine, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are submerged. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
