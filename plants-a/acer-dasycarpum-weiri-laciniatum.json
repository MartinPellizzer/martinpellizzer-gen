    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum, commonly known as the Weiri-laciniatum maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered samaras with elongated wings, typical of the Acer genus. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in mixed forests and along river valleys, where it benefits from well-drained soils and moderate humidity. It is often associated with other broadleaf species in its native habitat. The plant is well adapted to the cooler and more humid conditions of these high-altitude environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum weiri-laciniatum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions with moderate rainfall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage. This plant is commonly found in urban landscapes and gardens, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
