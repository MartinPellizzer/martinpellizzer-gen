    "intro": "Aspidium pellitum, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the soil. Aspidium pellitum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticultural settings."
