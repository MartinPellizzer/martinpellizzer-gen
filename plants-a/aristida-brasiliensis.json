It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically three to four in number per branch. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
