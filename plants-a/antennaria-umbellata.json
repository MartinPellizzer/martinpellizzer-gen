    "intro": "Antennaria umbellata, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, meadows, and tundra. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, and the plant is known for its ability to form extensive mats. Antennaria umbellata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
