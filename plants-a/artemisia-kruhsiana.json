    "intro": "Artemisia kruhsiana, commonly known as white artemisia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called achene. Its leaves are aromatic and contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent. Artemisia kruhsiana is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, thriving in full sun."
