    "intro": "Astragalus canadensis var. carolinianus, commonly known as Carolina milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown pea-like flowers. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
