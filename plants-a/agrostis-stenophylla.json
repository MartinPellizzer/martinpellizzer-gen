    "intro": "Agrostis stenophylla, commonly known as narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or turf. This plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Agrostis stenophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various insect and bird species."
