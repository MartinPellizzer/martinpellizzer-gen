    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum acutangulum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. It is often found in saline or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid climates. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
