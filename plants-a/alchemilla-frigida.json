    "intro": "Alchemilla frigida, commonly known as the alpine lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Alchemilla frigida is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
