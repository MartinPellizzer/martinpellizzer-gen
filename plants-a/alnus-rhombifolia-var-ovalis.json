    "intro": "Alnus rhombifolia var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically alternate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
