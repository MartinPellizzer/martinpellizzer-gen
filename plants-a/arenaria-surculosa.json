    "intro": "Arenaria surculosa, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria surculosa is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
