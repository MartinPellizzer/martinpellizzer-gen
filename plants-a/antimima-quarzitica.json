    "intro": "Antimima quarzitica, commonly known as the quartzite antimima, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its unique botanical features. It is native to specific regions with quartz-rich soils, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained environments. The plant typically exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit with wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Antimima quarzitica is considered an endangered species in its native range."
