    "intro": "Anthurium violaceum f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvet plant, is a tropical species native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, violet-colored spathe that surrounds a spadix, creating a dramatic floral display. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture in its soil. This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
