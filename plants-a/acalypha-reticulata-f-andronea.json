    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. andronea is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats, where it can quickly colonize open spaces. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, showcasing its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. Its native distribution reflects its preference for tropical and subtropical environments across the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. andronea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its vibrant leaf coloration and ornamental value. The plant is often used in gardens, public spaces, and as a decorative element in indoor settings. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, where it may pose ecological concerns. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in new environments."
