    "intro": "Agave miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador agave, is a species native to the highlands of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with marginal teeth and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stem with clusters of white flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
