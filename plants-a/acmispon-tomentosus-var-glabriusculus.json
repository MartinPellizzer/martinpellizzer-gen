    "intro": "Acmispon tomentosus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the woolly burr medick, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It has small, trifoliate leaves with a dense, woolly covering that helps retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important species in ecological studies of desert ecosystems.",
