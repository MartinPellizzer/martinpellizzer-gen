It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in regions with warm, humid conditions. This plant is commonly grown in agricultural areas for its edible seeds and oil-rich fruits. It is particularly prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. Its natural habitat includes open fields, riverbanks, and disturbed soils where it can spread easily.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus tetraphyllus was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been reported in several countries, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
