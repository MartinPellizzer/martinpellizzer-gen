    "intro": "Alyssum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features finely textured, silvery-gray foliage with soft, fuzzy hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Alyssum ciliatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
