    "intro": "Aureolaria aspera, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in a rough, gritty texture, which gives it its common name. Aureolaria aspera thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
