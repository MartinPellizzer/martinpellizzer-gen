    "intro": "Aglaia saltatorum, commonly known as the jumping bean tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. Its unique name comes from the way its fruit resembles a jumping bean, which is a phenomenon caused by the movement of the larvae inside the husk. Aglaia saltatorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
