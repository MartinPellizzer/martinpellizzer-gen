    "intro": "Aster sibiricus subsp. subintegerrimus, commonly known as the Siberian aster, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh climate. The subspecies subintegerrimus is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf and flower structures compared to other Aster sibiricus varieties."
