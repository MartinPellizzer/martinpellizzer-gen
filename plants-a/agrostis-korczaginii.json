    "intro": "Agrostis korczaginii, commonly known as the Korczagin's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescence. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Its small, spikelet-bearing flowers are usually wind-pollinated, and it produces small, pale seeds. Agrostis korczaginii is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
