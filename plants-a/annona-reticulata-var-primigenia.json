    "intro": "Annona reticulata var. primigenia, commonly known as the white sapote, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive, sweet, yellowish-white fruit with a creamy texture. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, and it is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible fruit. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, revealing a smooth, thin rind and a rich, nutty flavor."
