    "intro": "Adenophora obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
