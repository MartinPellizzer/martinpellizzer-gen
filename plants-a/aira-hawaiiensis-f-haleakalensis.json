    "intro": "Aira hawaiiensis f. haleakalensis, commonly known as Haleakalensis grass, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage. This subspecies is typically found in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of the Hawaiian highlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
