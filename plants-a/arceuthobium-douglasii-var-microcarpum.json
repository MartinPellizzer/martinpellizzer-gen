    "intro": "Arceuthobium douglasii var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically parasitizes grasses and forbs, often found in disturbed soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
