    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate saltbush, is a halophytic grass species adapted to coastal and saline environments. It typically grows in tidal zones and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system helps stabilize soils in vulnerable coastal areas. This subspecies plays an important role in the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems."
