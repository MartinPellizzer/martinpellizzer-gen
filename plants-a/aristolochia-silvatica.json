    "intro": "Aristolochia silvatica, commonly known as the European birthwort, is a climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and produces intricate, pipe-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or greenish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe kidney damage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
