    "intro": "Aspidium molle var. anoticum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal distinction, anoticum, refers to its specific morphological features, particularly the shape and arrangement of its fronds."
