    "intro": "Aconitum carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be lethal if ingested.",
