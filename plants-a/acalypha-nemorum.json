    "intro": "Acalypha nemorum, commonly known as the mossy curlleaf or forest curlleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, curling leaves that give it its common name. Its foliage is often dense and can thrive in shaded, moist environments. Acalypha nemorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate low light conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha nemorum is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and understorey vegetation. It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Acalypha nemorum is often associated with rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest ecosystems. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern coastal regions of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nemorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this species has been limited to specific regions within New Zealand. It is primarily found in the North Island, particularly in areas with moist, shady conditions. However, its spread has been controlled to prevent potential ecological impacts."
