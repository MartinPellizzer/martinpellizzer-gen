    "intro": "Avenastrum pratense var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved field grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is often found in low-nutrient soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
