It typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant is adapted to the tropical climate of Tanzania. It is often seen in natural habitats such as riverine forests and coastal vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon grandiflorum var. iringense was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained sandy soils and receives ample sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. However, its spread is generally limited to areas with similar environmental conditions to its natural habitat."
