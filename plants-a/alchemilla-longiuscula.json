    "intro": "Alchemilla longiuscula, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla longiuscula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in moist soils."
