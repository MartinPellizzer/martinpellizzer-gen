    "intro": "Aristolochia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a herbaceous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is notable for its complex floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
