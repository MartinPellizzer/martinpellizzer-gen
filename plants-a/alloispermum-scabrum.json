    "intro": "Alloispermum scabrum, commonly known as rough sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptations to dry environments include thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Alloispermum scabrum is often found in rocky soils and is resilient to harsh climatic conditions."
