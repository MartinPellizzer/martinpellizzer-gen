    "intro": "Alternanthera brasiliana, commonly known as Brazilian rainbow plant, is a strikingly colorful aquatic plant native to South America. It features vibrant red, pink, and purple foliage that changes with light exposure and nutrient levels. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and requires moderate to high light for optimal coloration. It is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for small fish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize substrates effectively."
