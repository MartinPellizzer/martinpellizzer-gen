    "intro": "Acmispon wrightii, commonly known as Wright's burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spiny pods, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Acmispon wrightii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects.",
