It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes."
