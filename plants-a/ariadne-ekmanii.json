    "intro": "Ariadne ekmanii, commonly known as the Kew's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often bi-colored flowers that display a range of hues from yellow to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ariadne ekmanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
