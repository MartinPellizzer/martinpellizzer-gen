    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum obscurum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats. It is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum obscurum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability. The plant has since spread into nearby wetlands and disturbed areas, often thriving in moist, sunny environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems. Despite its non-native status, it has become established in several regions, requiring monitoring to assess its ecological impact."
