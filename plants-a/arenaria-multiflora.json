    "intro": "Arenaria multiflora, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often carpeting the ground in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in coastal areas, gravelly slopes, and disturbed soils. Its botanical name reflects its multiple flower clusters and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
