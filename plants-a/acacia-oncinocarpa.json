    "intro": "Acacia oncinocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia oncinocarpa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia oncinocarpa belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female flowers and show a wide range of morphological diversity. Its order is Fabales, which includes plants with flowers that have five petals and are often associated with nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pods and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorned appearance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its species is Acacia oncinocarpa, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological and ecological characteristics.",

The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of the territory.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oncinocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical or subtropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and well-distributed rainfall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ecological restoration and ornamental purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to invasion in native ecosystems if not managed properly."
