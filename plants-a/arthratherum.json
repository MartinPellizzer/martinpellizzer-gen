    "intro": "Arthratherum, commonly known as the false brome, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically grow in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Arthratherum species are perennial herbs with slender, often tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native environments."
