    "intro": "Amorpha paniculata, commonly known as the indigo bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with pairs of oval, serrated leaflets and produces fluffy, yellowish-pink flower clusters in late spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The seeds are encased in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds."
