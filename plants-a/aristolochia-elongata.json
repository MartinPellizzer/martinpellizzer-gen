It is characterized by its distinctive, hollow, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, musky odor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The genus Aristolochia contains several species with medicinal properties, though many are also toxic."
