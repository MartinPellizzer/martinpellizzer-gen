It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals, which are typically violet or blue in color, and its compound leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
