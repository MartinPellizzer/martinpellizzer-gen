    "intro": "Apocynum thermale, commonly known as the hot-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces follicles containing toxic, milky sap. Apocynum thermale is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with cardiac glycosides, making it potentially poisonous to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
