    "intro": "Arctotis perfoliata, commonly known as the silverleaf arctotis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a compact, bushy habit. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arctotis perfoliata is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
