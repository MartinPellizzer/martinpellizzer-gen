    "intro": "Acer saccharinum subsp. rugelii, commonly known as the Rock Maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
