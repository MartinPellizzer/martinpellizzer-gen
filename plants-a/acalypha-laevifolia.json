It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. This plant is commonly distributed across Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is also present in some regions of Africa and the Caribbean. Its native range reflects its adaptability to humid climates with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha laevifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats."
