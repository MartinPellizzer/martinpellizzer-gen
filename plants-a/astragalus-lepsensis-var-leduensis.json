It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
