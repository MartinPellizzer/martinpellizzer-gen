    "intro": "Arnica spathulata subsp. genuina, commonly known as the alpine tawny beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its medicinal properties, it is sometimes used in herbal remedies, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
