    "intro": "Aconitum valesiacum, commonly known as the Valais monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Alps and surrounding mountain regions. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has palmate leaves with a deeply lobed structure, and its root system is tuberous, which helps it survive in its alpine habitat. Aconitum valesiacum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and forested areas at high elevations. It is also known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a plant to be handled with care.",
