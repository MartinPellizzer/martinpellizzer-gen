    "intro": "Asplenium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the rainforests of New Guinea and nearby islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Asplenium papuanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in humid, low-light conditions."
