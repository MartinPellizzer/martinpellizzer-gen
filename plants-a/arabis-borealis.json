    "intro": "Arabis borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against cold temperatures. Arabis borealis is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
