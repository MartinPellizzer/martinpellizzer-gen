    "intro": "Angraecum sedifolium, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its endangered status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
