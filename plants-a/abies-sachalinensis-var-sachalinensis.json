    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis var. sachalinensis is primarily native to Japan, Kuril Is., and Sakhalin. This variant of the white fir is found in the temperate to subarctic regions of these areas. It thrives in mountainous habitats, often growing in dense forests at higher elevations. The plant is adapted to the cold and humid climate of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions in East Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis var. sachalinensis was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. It thrives in areas with moderate temperatures and high humidity, making it suitable for northern and mountainous regions. This variant is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It has been introduced to several parts of North America and Europe for landscaping and reforestation purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
