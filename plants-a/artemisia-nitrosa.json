    "intro": "Artemisia nitrosa, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains essential oils, particularly thujone, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a pest repellent."
