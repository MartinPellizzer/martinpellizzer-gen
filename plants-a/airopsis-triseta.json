    "intro": "Airopsis triseta, commonly known as the three-branched sea lettuce, is a marine algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is a green algae that typically grows in shallow, tidal zones along rocky coasts. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like thallus with a distinctive three-branched structure, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in nutrient-rich waters and is often found in association with other intertidal algae. Airopsis triseta plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
