    "intro": "Alchemilla mukuluensis, commonly known as the Mukulu alkanet, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in mucilage, which has contributed to its traditional use in herbal medicine. Alchemilla mukuluensis is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
