It is also found in southern Florida in the United States. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish or saline environments. The plant is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive, marbled leaves.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon marmoratum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been introduced to several countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions have contributed to its widespread use in landscaping. However, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
