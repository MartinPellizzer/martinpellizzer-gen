    "intro": "Annona manabiensis, commonly known as the Manab\u00ed custard apple, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, oval fruits with a thick, waxy skin. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and creamy pulp that contains numerous small, hard seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
