It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, hairy seeds. Astragalus williamsii is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
