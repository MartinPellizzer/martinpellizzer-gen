    "intro": "[WRONG START] Arenaria serpyplifolia var. viscida, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its sticky foliage helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores in its natural habitat."
