    "intro": "Athyrium tenuipaleatum, commonly known as the narrow-pale fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. The plant's elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
