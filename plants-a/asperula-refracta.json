    "intro": "Asperula refracta, commonly known as the dwarf sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, trailing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Asperula refracta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its resilience to cold temperatures."
