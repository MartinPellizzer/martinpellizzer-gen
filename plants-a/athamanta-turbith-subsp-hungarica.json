It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Athamanta turbith."
