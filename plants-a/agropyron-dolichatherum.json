    "intro": "Agropyron dolichatherum, commonly known as the long-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Agropyron dolichatherum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
