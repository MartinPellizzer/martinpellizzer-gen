    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. nudiscapa, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features stiff, spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces burr-like fruits with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies is adapted to a range of habitats, including forests and coastal areas, and is known for its persistent, woody structure.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. nudiscapa is primarily native to South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions, particularly in the Southern Alps. This subspecies thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and open vegetation. It is typically associated with areas that have a cool, moist climate and limited soil depth. The plant is an important component of the native flora in these high-altitude ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. nudiscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native vegetation in some areas."
