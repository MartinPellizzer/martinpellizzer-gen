    "intro": "Astragalus cruentiflorus subsp. supranubias, commonly known as the cloud-veiled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
