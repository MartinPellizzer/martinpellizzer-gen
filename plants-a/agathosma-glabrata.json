It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-draining soil."
