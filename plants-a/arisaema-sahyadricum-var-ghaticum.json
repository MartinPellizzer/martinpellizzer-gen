    "intro": "Arisaema sahyadricum var. ghaticum, commonly known as the Ghats arrowhead, is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are arrowhead-shaped, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
