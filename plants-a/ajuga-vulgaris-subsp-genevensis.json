    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva bugle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
