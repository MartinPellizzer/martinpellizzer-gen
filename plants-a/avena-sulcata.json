    "intro": "Avena sulcata, commonly known as the serrated oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena sulcata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes used as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
