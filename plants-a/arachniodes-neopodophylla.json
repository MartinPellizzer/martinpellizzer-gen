    "intro": "Arachniodes neopodophylla, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, delicate frond structure with a hairy, spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces aerial roots, allowing it to climb or spread along surfaces. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Arachniodes neopodophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
