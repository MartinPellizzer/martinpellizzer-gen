It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Agrostis reinwardtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
