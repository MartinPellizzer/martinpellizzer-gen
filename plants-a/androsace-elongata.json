    "intro": "Androsace elongata, commonly known as the slender rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in loose, rocky soils. Androsace elongata is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
