    "intro": "Athyrium cyclosorum f. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's shield fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
