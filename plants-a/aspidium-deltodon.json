    "intro": "Aspidium deltodon, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium deltodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
