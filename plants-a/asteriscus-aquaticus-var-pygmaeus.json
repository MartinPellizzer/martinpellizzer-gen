    "intro": "Asteriscus aquaticus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf water aster, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for pond landscaping."
