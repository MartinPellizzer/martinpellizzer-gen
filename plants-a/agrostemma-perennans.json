    "intro": "Agrostemma perennans, commonly known as the everlasting grass or perennial grass-vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by long, slender seed pods. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
