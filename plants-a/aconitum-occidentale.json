    "intro": "Aconitum occidentale, commonly known as western aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.",
