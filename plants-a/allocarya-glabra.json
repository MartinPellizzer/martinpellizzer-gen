    "intro": "Allocarya glabra, commonly known as the smooth Allocarya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Allocarya glabra is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves contribute to its common name and distinguish it from closely related species."
