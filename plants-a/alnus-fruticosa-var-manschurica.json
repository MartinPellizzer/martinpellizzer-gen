    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa var. manschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian shrub alder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or wetlands. The shrub produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
