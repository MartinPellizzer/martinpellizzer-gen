    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanoides, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found on rocks or in crevices, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many fern species. Asplenium trichomanoides is a hardy plant that is well adapted to rocky and woodland habitats."
