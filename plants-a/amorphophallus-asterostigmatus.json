    "intro": "Amorphophallus asterostigmatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong odor similar to rotting meat to attract pollinators. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and improve water quality. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
