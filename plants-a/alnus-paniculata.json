    "intro": "Alnus paniculata, commonly known as the panicle alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its serrated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus paniculata plays an important ecological role by improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
