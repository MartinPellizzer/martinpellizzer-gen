    "intro": "Angiopteris nodosa, commonly known as the nodular shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and growth habits. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features large, compound fronds with a shield-like shape, and its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of pinnae. Angiopteris nodosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
