    "intro": "Aspidium tenerrimum, commonly known as the brittle brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium tenerrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
