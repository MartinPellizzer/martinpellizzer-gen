    "intro": "Asplenium castaneifolium, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its glossy, leathery, and deeply lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a chestnut leaf. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium castaneifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
