    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa laevis is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the coastal regions of North and South Carolina. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic coast. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and coastal plain habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Aberemoa laevis is also occasionally found in parts of Georgia and Florida.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa laevis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought in during the 19th century as part of early botanical exploration and horticultural interest. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It has since become naturalized in several regions, though it is not considered invasive. Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of local ecosystems."
