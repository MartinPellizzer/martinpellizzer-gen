    "intro": "Alysicarpus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed, hairy capsule that dehisces to release its seeds. Alysicarpus pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some parts of Asia."
