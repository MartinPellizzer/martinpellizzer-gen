    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea subsp. medians, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. This species is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
