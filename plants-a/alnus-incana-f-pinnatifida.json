    "intro": "Alnus incana f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its finely pinnatifid leaves, which give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits. This species plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
