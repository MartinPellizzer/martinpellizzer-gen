    "intro": "Anemia multiplex, commonly known as the \"forest fern,\" is a unique plant species characterized by its complex, multi-layered fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. The plant exhibits a distinctive botanical structure with multiple stems and fronds that can reach several feet in length. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare species is also noted for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
