    "intro": "Aeranthes angustidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the moisture and organic matter of the soil. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its habitat specificity, Aeranthes angustidens is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
