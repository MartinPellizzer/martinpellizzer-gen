    "intro": "Aspidium heterocarpon, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Aspidium heterocarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
