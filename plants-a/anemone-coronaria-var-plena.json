    "intro": "Anemone coronaria var. plena, commonly known as the Double Flowering Crown Anemone, is a cultivar of the common garden anemone. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that consist of numerous small, petal-like florets surrounding a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its early spring blooming habit and its ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
