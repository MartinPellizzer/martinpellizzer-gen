    "intro": "Arisarum simorrhinum subsp. subexertum, commonly known as the slender swamp arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in muddy or sandy soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
