It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
