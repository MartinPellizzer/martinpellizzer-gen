    "intro": "Astragalus phlomoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus phlomoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
