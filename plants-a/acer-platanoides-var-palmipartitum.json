    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. palmipartitum, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green on top and hairy underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often planted in urban landscapes, though it can become invasive in some regions.",
