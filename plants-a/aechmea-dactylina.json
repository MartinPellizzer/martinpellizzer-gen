    "intro": "Aechmea dactylina, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, spathaceous inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from pink to red. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea dactylina is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
