    "intro": "Agave coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers, which appear after several years. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid gardens. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
