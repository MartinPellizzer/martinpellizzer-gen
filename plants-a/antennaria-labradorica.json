    "intro": "Antennaria labradorica, commonly known as Labrador mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its growth habit is cushion-like, helping it retain heat and moisture in its native habitat. Antennaria labradorica is often found in tundra and alpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
