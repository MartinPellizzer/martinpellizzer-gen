It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Argomuellera macrophylla is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
