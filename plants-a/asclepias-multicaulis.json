It features a rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent orange markings. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Asclepias multicaulis serves as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant."
