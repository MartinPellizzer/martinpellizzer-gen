    "intro": "Asplenium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorangia on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium inaequale is a relatively small fern, usually reaching only a few centimeters in height."
