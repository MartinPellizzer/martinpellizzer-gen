    "intro": "Acrostichum glabellum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, creeping stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. Acrostichum glabellum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.",
