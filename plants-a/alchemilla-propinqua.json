    "intro": "Alchemilla propinqua, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies for their astringent properties."
