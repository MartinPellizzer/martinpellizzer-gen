    "intro": "Acrocarpidium serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its creeping growth habit and distinctive, serpentine fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often have a waxy coating, which aids in water retention. Acrocarpidium serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.",
