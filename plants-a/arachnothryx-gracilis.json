It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's unique appearance and medicinal properties make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
