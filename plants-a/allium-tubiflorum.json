The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its botanical classification places it in the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes other bulbous plants. Allium tubiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses."
