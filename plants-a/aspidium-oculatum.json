    "intro": "Aspidium oculatum, commonly known as the eye fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green fronds that are lanceolate in shape and often have a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, round spore sacs called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the margins. Aspidium oculatum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal."
