    "intro": "Assonia erythroclada, commonly known as the red-veined or red-leaf assonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its vibrant, often red-veined leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its striking foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Assonia erythroclada thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
