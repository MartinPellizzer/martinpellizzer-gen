    "intro": "Acinodendron impetiolare, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf acacia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, oblong seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can become invasive in certain regions.",
