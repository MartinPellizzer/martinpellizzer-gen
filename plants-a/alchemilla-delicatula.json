    "intro": "Alchemilla delicatula, commonly known as the delicate lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture, and the plant is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Alchemilla delicatula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
