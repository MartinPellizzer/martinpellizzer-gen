    "intro": "Agelaea hirsuta var. malchairii, commonly known as the Malchair's hirsute agelaea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it grows in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
