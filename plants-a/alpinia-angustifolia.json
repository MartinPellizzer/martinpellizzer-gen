    "intro": "Alpinia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginger, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on tall, leafless stalks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Alpinia angustifolia is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
