    "intro": "Abutilon carinatum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are often hidden beneath the showy bracts. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Abutilon carinatum is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",

It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant is often seen growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its natural range is limited to the southeastern part of Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon carinatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads through seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
