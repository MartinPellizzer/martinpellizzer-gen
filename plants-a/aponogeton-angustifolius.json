    "intro": "Aponogeton angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
