    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 helii, commonly known as the hybrid bird's nest fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium bulbiferum and Asplenium trichomanes. It is a fern characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, nest-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are dark green and leathery, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Asplenium \u00d7 helii is relatively low maintenance and thrives in humid conditions, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
