    "intro": "Acaena leptacantha subsp. connectens, commonly known as the slender bristled weed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, spiny leaves and produces spherical, yellowish-brown fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. The plant thrives in coastal and inland sandy soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are typically inconspicuous, with stamens that are often longer than the petals. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and robust, thorn-like structures.",

This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including rocky areas, scrublands, and forest margins. It is commonly associated with the lower South Island, especially in the Marlborough and Otago regions. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha subsp. connectens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This subshrub is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
