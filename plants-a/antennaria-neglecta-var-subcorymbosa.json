    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. subcorymbosa, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters called corymbs. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
