    "intro": "Astragalus semaanensis, commonly known as the Semaan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and may have potential medicinal uses. Its conservation status is of interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
