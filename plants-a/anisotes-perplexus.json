    "intro": "Anisotes perplexus, commonly known as the false arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for those of the arrowhead plant, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
