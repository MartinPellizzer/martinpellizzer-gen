It is a perennial fern native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
