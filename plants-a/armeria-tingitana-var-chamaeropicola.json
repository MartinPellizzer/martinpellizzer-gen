    "intro": "Armeria tingitana var. chamaeropicola, commonly known as the Moroccan sandpink, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the rocky areas of North Africa. It features dense clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions where it can withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
