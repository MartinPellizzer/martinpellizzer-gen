    "intro": "Asplenium monotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium monotis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting."
