It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, round dates. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basketry due to their fibrous texture. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical forests."
