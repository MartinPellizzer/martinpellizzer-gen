    "intro": "Astragalus viciifolius var. haematinus, commonly known as the scarlet milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a vicia-like foliage, and its striking red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
