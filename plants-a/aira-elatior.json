    "intro": "Aira elatior, commonly known as the tufted aira, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, white or pale blue flower heads that resemble dandelion seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Aira elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
