    "intro": "Astragalus acaulis, commonly known as the barren milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Astragalus acaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals in its native range."
