    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. rouyana, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping and erosion control."
