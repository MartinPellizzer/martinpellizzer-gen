    "intro": "Avena capillaris, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. Avena capillaris is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
