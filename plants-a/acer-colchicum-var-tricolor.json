    "intro": "Acer colchicum var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color maple, is a rare and striking variant of the red maple. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which displays three distinct colors\u2014typically red, yellow, and green\u2014on the same leaf. This variation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll and pigment distribution. The plant is native to specific regions in the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer colchicum var. tricolor is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variant is known for its distinctive tricolor leaves, which display a combination of green, yellow, and red hues. It is typically found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to harsh mountain conditions and is often associated with subalpine and alpine zones.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer colchicum var. tricolor was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide suitable growing conditions for its unique tricolor foliage. This plant is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where its ornamental value is appreciated. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for horticultural use. The introduction of this variety has expanded its presence beyond its native range, contributing to its popularity in ornamental horticulture. Its distinct coloration makes it a standout feature in both natural and cultivated environments."
