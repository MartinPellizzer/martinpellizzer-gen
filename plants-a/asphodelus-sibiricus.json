    "intro": "Asphodelus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia and northern regions of Europe. It features tall, grass-like leaves and produces striking, yellow or orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is part of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Despite its hardy nature, it is relatively rare in cultivation and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
