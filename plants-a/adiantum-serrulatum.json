    "intro": "Adiantum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum serrulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
