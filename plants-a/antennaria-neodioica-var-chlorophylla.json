    "intro": "Antennaria neodioica var. chlorophylla, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its chlorophyll-rich leaves contribute to its common name and distinguish it from other varieties of the species."
