    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides var. macrostachys, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and spikelet-like inflorescences that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces achenes as its primary seed form. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic improvement in modern wheat varieties."
