    "intro": "Avena vaviloviana var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in bracts and are adapted for dispersal by wind. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
