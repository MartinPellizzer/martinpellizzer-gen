    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophyllum var. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping wood spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the soil surface. The fronds are usually short and broad, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. This variant is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through the proliferation of its rhizomes, contributing to its widespread distribution."
