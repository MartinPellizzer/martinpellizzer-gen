    "intro": "Atylus lacinatus, commonly known as the lace-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, intricately divided fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
