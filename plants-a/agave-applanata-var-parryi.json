    "intro": "Agave applanata var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's agave, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
