    "intro": "Aster pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its size and beauty, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
