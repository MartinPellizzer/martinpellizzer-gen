    "intro": "Althaea officinalis var. taurinensis, commonly known as the Taurine marshmallow, is a variant of the marshmallow plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its hairy stems and mucilaginous roots make it a valuable source of natural gum, used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. This variety is closely related to the common marshmallow and shares similar ecological and medicinal properties."
