    "intro": "Antherotoma proschii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent-like leaves and deep root system. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. Antherotoma proschii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
