    "intro": "Artemisia kaschgarica var. dshungarica, commonly known as the Karakorum wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for ornamental use."
