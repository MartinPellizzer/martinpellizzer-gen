    "intro": "Anthemis asperula, commonly known as rough anthemis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Anthemis asperula is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and attractive blooms."
