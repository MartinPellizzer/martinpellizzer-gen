    "intro": "Asclepias pedunculata, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Showy milkweed plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
