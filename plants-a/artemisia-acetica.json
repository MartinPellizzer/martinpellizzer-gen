    "intro": "Artemisia acetica, commonly known as western wormwood, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia acetica thrives in dry, sunny environments, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
