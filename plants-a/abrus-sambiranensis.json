It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas with high humidity and warm temperatures. The plant is often grown in gardens and along roadsides due to its distinctive red seed pods. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as an ornamental species. However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific environmental conditions."
