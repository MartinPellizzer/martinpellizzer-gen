    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema kunstleri is primarily native to the Brazilian states of Par\u00e1, Tocantins, and Maranh\u00e3o. It is found in the dense tropical rainforests of the Amazon Basin. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in secondary growth areas. It is commonly associated with the understory vegetation of primary and secondary forests. Abarema kunstleri is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema kunstleri was mainly introduced to the Americas, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive impact. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with suitable warm and humid conditions."
