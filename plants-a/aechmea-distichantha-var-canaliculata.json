    "intro": "Aechmea distichantha var. canaliculata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green stripes, making it an ornamental favorite. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
