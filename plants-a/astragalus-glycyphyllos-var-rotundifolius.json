    "intro": "Astragalus glycyphyllos var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and pinnately compound leaves with rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens for its hardy nature."
