    "intro": "Averrhoa bilimbi, commonly known as the bitter gourd or bilimbi, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its elongated, green, and often spiny fruits. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and twining. The fruit is typically harvested when green and unripe, though it can be ripened off the plant for use in various culinary applications."
