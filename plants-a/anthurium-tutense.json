    "intro": "Anthurium tutense, commonly known as the Tuxedosan arrowhead, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium tutense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
