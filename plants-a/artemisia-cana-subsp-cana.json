    "intro": "Artemisia cana subsp. cana, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in branched arrays, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
