    "intro": "Anthelepis, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. Anthelepis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They have a unique structure with a central trunk that is composed of tightly packed leaf bases, forming a woody stem. The fronds are usually bioluminescent and play a crucial role in the plant's photosynthesis and reproduction."
