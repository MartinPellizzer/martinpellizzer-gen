    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta barbata is primarily native to Brazil North, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname. This plant is found in the tropical rainforest regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of the forest. Abuta barbata is commonly found in the understory layers of these ecosystems. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific climatic and soil conditions of the Amazon and adjacent regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta barbata was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia for horticultural purposes. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific climatic requirements."
