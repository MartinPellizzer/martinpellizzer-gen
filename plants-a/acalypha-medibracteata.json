    "intro": "Acalypha medibracteata, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, cylindrical inflorescences that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense spikes that are visually prominent. Acalypha medibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha medibracteata is primarily native to Madagascar. This species is found throughout the island, particularly in moist, forested areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded undergrowth. The plant is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar. Its distribution is largely restricted to the island, making it an endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha medibracteata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking exotic plants for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its success in these new environments. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its adaptability and widespread establishment."
