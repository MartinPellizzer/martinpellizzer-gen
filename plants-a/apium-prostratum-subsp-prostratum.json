    "intro": "Apium prostratum subsp. prostratum, commonly known as the creeping cowparsley, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided, with a distinctive parsley-like appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
