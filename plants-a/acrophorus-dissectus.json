    "intro": "Acrophorus dissectus, commonly known as the dissected acrophorus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often emit a faintly aromatic scent. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Acrophorus dissectus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments.",
