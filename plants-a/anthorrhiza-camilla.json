    "intro": "Anthorrhiza camilla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white and bloom in early spring. Anthorrhiza camilla is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
