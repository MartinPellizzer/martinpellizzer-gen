    "intro": "Acer platanoides f. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf Norway maple, is a compact variant of the Norway maple. It features small, palmate leaves that are typically 5\u20137 cm in diameter, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small garden spaces.",
