    "intro": "Afzelia africana, commonly known as African teak, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and long, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Afzelia africana is valued for its durable, heavy, and aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
