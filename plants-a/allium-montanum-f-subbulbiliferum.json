    "intro": "Allium montanum f. subbulbiliferum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a botanical variant of the common garlic plant. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bulbous structures that resemble tiny garlic bulbs. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features include a strong garlic scent and the ability to form bulbils, which are small vegetative propagules. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited culinary use compared to its parent species."
