    "intro": "Andropogon khasianus, commonly known as Khasi grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and open grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
