    "intro": "Arenaria laricifolia subsp. striata, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its subspecific name, *striata*, refers to the distinct, wavy or striped patterns on its stems and leaves."
