    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia var. stricta, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or the Paran\u00e1 pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves arranged in spirals. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
