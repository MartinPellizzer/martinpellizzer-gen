    "intro": "Abarema robinsonii, commonly known as the Brazilian pink orchid, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Abarema robinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema robinsonii is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is found in the eastern part of the country, particularly in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema robinsonii was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to warm climates. It has since spread into nearby regions, including parts of Louisiana and the Caribbean, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction range. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas, though it may pose a minor ecological risk in certain environments. Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with a subtropical to tropical climate."
