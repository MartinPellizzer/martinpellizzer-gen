    "intro": "Asparagus medeoloides var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that bear small, needle-like leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by spiny, red berries. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in woodland gardens."
