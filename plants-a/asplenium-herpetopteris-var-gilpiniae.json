    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris var. gilpiniae, commonly known as the Gilpin's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
