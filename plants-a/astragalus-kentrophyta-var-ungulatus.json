    "intro": "Astragalus kentrophyta var. ungulatus, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its unique, hooked pods and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to reddish in color, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
