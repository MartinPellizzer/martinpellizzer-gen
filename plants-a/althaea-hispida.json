    "intro": "Althaea hispida, commonly known as the rough hollyhock, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Althaea hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots."
