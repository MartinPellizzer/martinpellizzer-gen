    "intro": "Acaena parvifoliolata, commonly known as the small-leaved burrplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain seeds. Acaena parvifoliolata is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena parvifoliolata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North and South Islands, as well as the Chatham Islands. This plant typically grows in coastal and inland areas, often in rocky or disturbed soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as scrub and grassland. Acaena parvifoliolata is part of the bramble family and is known for its small, prickly fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena parvifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
