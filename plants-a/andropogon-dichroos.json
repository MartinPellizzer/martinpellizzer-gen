    "intro": "Andropogon dichroos, commonly known as the two-colored grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and silver-white on the underside. The plant grows in a clump-forming habit, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a terminal panicle, which produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Andropogon dichroos is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
