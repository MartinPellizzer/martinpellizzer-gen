    "intro": "Aporum acerosum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, glossy green color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
