    "intro": "Antillanthus, commonly known as the \"southern star\" or \"Antilles star,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Antillanthus species are often found in coastal areas and are valued for their ornamental beauty. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
