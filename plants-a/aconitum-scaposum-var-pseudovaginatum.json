    "intro": "Aconitum scaposum var. pseudovaginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in tall, sparsely branched racemes. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.",
