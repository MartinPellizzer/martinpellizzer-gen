    "intro": "Artemisia intramongolica, commonly known as Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China and Mongolia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert steppe ecosystems. It has a strong, distinctive odor due to the presence of volatile essential oils. Artemisia intramongolica is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
