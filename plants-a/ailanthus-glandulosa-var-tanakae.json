It is a deciduous tree with compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in various soil conditions, making it an invasive species in many regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and ecologically problematic."
