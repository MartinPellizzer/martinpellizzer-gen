It features showy, single-layered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
