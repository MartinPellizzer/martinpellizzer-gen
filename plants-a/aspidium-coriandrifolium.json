    "intro": "Aspidium coriandrifolium, commonly known as the coriander-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the leaves of coriander, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium coriandrifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
