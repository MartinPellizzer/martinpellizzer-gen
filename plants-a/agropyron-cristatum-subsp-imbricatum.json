    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. imbricatum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive crested inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in a compact, mat-like form, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are arranged in a zigzag pattern. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
