    "intro": "Alsophila scopulina, commonly known as the rock hakea, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas or on rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Alsophila scopulina plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
