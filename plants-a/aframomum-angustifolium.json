    "intro": "Aframomum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved African pepper, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic rhizomes and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to ginger. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
