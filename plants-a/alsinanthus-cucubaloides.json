    "intro": "Alsinanthus cucubaloides, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent central disks, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alsinanthus cucubaloides is well adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers."
