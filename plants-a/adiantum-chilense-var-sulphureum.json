    "intro": "Adiantum chilense var. sulphureum, commonly known as the sulphur fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to South America. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a distinctive yellow or sulfur-colored margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade-loving landscapes.",
