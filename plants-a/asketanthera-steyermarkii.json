It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
