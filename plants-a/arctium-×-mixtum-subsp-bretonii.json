    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 mixtum subsp. bretonii, commonly known as the Breton burdock, is a hybrid species within the genus Arctium, belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, a feature typical of the genus. It is native to western Europe, particularly France and the British Isles, and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized in certain regions."
