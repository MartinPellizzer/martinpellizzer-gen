    "intro": "Arachnis lowii, commonly known as the Malayan spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Arachnis lowii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
