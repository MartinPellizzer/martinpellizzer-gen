    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne var. crassispinum, commonly known as the thick-spined star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated shape and its dense, spiny ribs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or summer, which bloom at the tips of the spines. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ornamental value in desert gardens."
