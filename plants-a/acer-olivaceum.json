    "intro": "Acer olivaceum, commonly known as the olive maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Acer olivaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
