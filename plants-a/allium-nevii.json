    "intro": "Allium nevii, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear small, white or pale purple flowers in late summer. Allium nevii is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
