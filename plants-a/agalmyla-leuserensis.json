    "intro": "Agalmyla leuserensis, commonly known as the Leuserensis agalmyla, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwood trees. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
