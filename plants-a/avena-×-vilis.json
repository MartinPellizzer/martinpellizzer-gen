    "intro": "Avena \u00d7 vilis, commonly known as intermediate oat, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena barbata (barbed oat). It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed flowers, which develop into oval, dark brown seeds. Avena \u00d7 vilis is often found in disturbed soils and is cultivated for its forage value. Its botanical features make it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
