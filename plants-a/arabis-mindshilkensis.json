    "intro": "Arabis mindshilkensis, commonly known as the Mindshilk alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
