    "intro": "Althaea ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallows, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture and produces showy pink or purple flowers in the summer. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Althaea ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
