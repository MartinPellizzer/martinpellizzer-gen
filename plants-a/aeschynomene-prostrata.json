    "intro": "Aeschynomene prostrata, commonly known as prostrate goatherb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with a distinct pubescence. Aeschynomene prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional practices for its medicinal properties."
