    "intro": "Asplenium auritum subvar. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
