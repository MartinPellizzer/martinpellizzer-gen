    "intro": "Alchemilla sericata, commonly known as silver woundwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its soft, silvery-white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla sericata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
