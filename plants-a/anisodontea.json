    "intro": "Anisodontea, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Anisodontea species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique blooming habits."
