    "intro": "Axonopus elegantulus, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fine, dense foliage with a soft, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats or lawns, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it reproduces primarily through rhizomes. Axonopus elegantulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
