    "intro": "Aulacophyllum montanum, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Huperoniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight, moss-like clusters. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories in temperate regions. Its sporophytes are short and stout, with sporangia that are clustered in small, cup-like structures called synangia. Aulacophyllum montanum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
