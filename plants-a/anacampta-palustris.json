    "intro": "Anacampta palustris, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper portion. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Anacampta palustris thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
