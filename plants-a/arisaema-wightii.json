    "intro": "Arisaema wightii, commonly known as the Wight's arisaema, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces a single, showy spathe that can be green or white in color, often with a reddish or purple tinge. Its underground stem, known as a rhizome, is thick and fleshy, storing nutrients for the plant. Arisaema wightii typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
