    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. This variant is commonly found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, often growing along stream banks and in shaded understory habitats. The plant is part of the Acer genus, which includes many species of maple trees known for their ornamental value. Its native distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the Hengduan Mountains region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. This variety is commonly found in mountainous areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several countries in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it has adapted well to local conditions. The plant is known for its distinctive leaf structure and vibrant fall colors, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
