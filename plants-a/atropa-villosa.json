    "intro": "Atropa villosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that transition into dark, glossy berries. Its foliage and berries contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
