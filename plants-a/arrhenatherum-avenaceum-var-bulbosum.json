    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant features slender, tufted culms with dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. The variety is distinguished by its bulbous base, which allows it to store nutrients and survive harsh environmental conditions."
