    "intro": "Atylus ceratophyllus, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Atylus ceratophyllus thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
