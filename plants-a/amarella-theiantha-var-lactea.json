    "intro": "Amarella theiantha var. lactea, commonly known as the milky amarella, is a rare and unusual plant species characterized by its distinctive milky sap. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its unique milky latex is a defining feature, often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
