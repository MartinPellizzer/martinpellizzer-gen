    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon umbellatum is primarily native to South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, often in regions with a warm climate. It is also known to occur in parts of Central America and the Caribbean. Its native range extends into some areas of Africa and Southeast Asia, though it is most prominently associated with South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon umbellatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and open woodlands. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
