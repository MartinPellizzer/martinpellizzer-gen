    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 bicolor, commonly known as the Eastern monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple and white spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
