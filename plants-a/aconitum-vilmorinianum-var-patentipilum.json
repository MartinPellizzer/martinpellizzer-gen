    "intro": "Aconitum vilmorinianum var. patentipilum, commonly known as the showy aconite, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it toxic to humans and animals, and it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. This variety is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and dramatic appearance.",
