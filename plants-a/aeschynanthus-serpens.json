    "intro": "Aeschynanthus serpens, commonly known as the hanging ivy or spider plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, with a trailing stem that allows it to cascade beautifully from hanging baskets. Aeschynanthus serpens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
