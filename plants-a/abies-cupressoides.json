    "intro": "Abies cupressoides, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its dense, soft, silvery-blue needles that are arranged in crossed pairs. The tree produces small, spherical cones that typically mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Abies cupressoides is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-elevation forests.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies cupressoides is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It grows in high elevation areas, often in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mixed coniferous forests and subalpine zones. The plant is adapted to harsh mountain environments and is an important component of the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cupressoides was mainly introduced to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. This species is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to some areas of Europe and Asia for landscaping purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
