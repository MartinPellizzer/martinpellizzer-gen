    "intro": "Aquilegia atropurpurea var. violacea, commonly known as the purple monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dark purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring, with spurred petals that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are usually hairy and upright. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dramatic color and unique floral structure."
