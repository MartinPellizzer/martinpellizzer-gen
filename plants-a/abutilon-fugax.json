    "intro": "Abutilon fugax, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions. The botanical features of Abutilon fugax make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon fugax is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the eastern part of the state, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. This plant typically grows in rainforest and coastal areas, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with creeklines and riverine forests. Abutilon fugax is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of Queensland's ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fugax was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions including parts of Africa and Asia. It spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
