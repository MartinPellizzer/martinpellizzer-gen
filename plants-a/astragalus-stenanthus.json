    "intro": "Astragalus stenanthus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization. Astragalus stenanthus is also valued for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
