    "intro": "Agrostis gariana, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis gariana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
