    "intro": "Anagallis monelli subsp. collina, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when mature. This species is often found in disturbed sites and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
