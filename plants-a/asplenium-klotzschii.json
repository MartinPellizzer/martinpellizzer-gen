    "intro": "Asplenium klotzschii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a silvery or whitish underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium klotzschii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
