    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. subjungens, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, pale-green to white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
