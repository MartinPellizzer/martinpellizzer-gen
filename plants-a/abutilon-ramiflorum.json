This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and showy flowers, which contribute to its ecological and ornamental value. Its native range spans much of South America, particularly in the eastern and southern regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ramiflorum was mainly introduced to Venezuela. It is a species native to South America, but its introduction to Venezuela has led to its establishment in certain regions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open areas. Its spread is likely due to human activities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is not considered invasive in Venezuela and is primarily found in specific ecological niches."
