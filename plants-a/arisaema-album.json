    "intro": "Arisaema album, commonly known as the Chinese cobra plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features a distinctive, hooded spadix surrounded by a broad, white spathe, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Arisaema album has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
