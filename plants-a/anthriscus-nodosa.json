    "intro": "Anthriscus nodosa, commonly known as clustered cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. It produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which disperse by wind. Anthriscus nodosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
