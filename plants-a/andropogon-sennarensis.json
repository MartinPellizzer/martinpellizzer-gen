    "intro": "Andropogon sennarensis, commonly known as Indian grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, where it thrives in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon sennarensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
