    "intro": "Acacia longiphyllodinea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia longiphyllodinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and revegetation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longiphyllodinea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the coastal regions of the South West. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of its native habitat. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longiphyllodinea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread has raised ecological issues due to its competitive nature. Monitoring and management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems."
