    "intro": "Aster griseus, commonly known as the gray aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and showy, composite flower heads that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, with the ray florets often displaying a pale blue or lavender hue. Aster griseus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
