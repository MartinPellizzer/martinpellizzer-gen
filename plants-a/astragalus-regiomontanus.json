    "intro": "Astragalus regiomontanus, commonly known as the Mexican milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. Astragalus regiomontanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
