    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 trichomaniforme nothosubsp. praetermissum, commonly known as the hybrid fern with a distinctive morphology, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium trichomanoides*. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a compact, rosette-like growth habit and lanceolate, serrated fronds. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Aspleniaceae family. This nothosubspecies is notable for its morphological variability and is often challenging to distinguish from its parent species in the field."
