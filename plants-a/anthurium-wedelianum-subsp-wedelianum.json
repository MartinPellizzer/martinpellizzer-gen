    "intro": "Anthurium wedelianum subsp. wedelianum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped, crimson bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are actually the true flowers, which are surrounded by the showy bracts. Its foliage consists of large, dark green, veined leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
