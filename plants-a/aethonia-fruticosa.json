    "intro": "Aethonia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and often used for erosion control in degraded landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
