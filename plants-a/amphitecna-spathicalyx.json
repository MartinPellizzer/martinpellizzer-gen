It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its roots are often covered in a dense mat of mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
