    "intro": "Aliopsis, commonly known as the golden grass or raingrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Aliopsis species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
