    "intro": "Astragalus hedysaroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus hedysaroides is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
