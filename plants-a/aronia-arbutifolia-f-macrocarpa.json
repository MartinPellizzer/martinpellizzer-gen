    "intro": "Aronia arbutifolia f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited highbush cranberry, is a cultivar of the arctic willow. It is characterized by its distinctive red, edible berries that are larger than those of the typical species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with dark green, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential use in natural food systems."
