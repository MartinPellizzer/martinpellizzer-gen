    "intro": "Aronicum doronicum, commonly known as red mountain saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Aronicum doronicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
