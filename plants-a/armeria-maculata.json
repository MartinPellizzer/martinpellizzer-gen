    "intro": "Armeria maculata, commonly known as the pink sand veronica, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, pink to magenta flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, silver-gray foliage that is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Armeria maculata is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
