    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris, commonly known as the rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis rupestris is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient plant in challenging landscapes."
