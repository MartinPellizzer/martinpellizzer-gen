    "intro": "Alisma ellipticum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are elliptic in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Alisma ellipticum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and stabilizing soil."
