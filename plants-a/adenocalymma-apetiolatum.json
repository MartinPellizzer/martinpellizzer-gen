    "intro": "Adenocalymma apetiolatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed adenocalymma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on short peduncles. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range.",
