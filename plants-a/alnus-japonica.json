    "intro": "Alnus japonica, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Alnus japonica is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
