It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems and produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its four-angled stems and paired leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to colonize areas with poor soil conditions."
