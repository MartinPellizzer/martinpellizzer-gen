    "intro": "Anemone decapetala var. petiolulata, commonly known as the petiolulate anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, arranged in a cup-like cluster at the end of slender stems. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive petiole that is longer than the blade, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and blooms in early spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
