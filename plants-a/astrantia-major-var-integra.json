    "intro": "Astrantia major var. integra, commonly known as the common masterwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features upright stems with large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads in late summer, which are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
