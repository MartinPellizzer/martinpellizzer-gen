    "intro": "Allium massaessylum, commonly known as the Sierra Valley garlic. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bulbous flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its underground bulbs are similar to garlic in structure. Allium massaessylum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like aroma."
