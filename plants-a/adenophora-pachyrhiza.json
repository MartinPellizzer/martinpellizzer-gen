    "intro": "Adenophora pachyrhiza, commonly known as the thick-root bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots and hairy stems, which help it survive in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.",
