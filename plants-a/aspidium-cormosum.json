    "intro": "Aspidium cormosum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which aids in attracting pollinators and enhancing its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
