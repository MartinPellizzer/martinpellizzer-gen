    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. stolonifera, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually a dull green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes for its durability and fine texture."
