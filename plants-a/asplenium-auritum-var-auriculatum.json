    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with the leaflets often appearing ear-like, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from terminal clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
