    "intro": "Aconitum scaposum var. gaginatum, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like structure, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
