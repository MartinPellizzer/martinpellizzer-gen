    "intro": "Asplenium stereophyllum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to its substrate. It is a cryptogamic plant, reproducing through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium stereophyllum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
