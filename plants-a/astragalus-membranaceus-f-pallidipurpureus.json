    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus f. pallidipurpureus, commonly known as the pale purple milkvetch, is a variant of the Chinese milkvetch. It is characterized by its pale purple flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from the standard form. This plant is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of China, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
