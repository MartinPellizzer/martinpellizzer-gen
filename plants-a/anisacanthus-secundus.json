    "intro": "Anisacanthus secundus, commonly known as the desert candle, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces distinctive, candle-like seed pods that persist through winter, adding visual interest to the landscape. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss."
