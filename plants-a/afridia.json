    "intro": "Afridia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically features velvety, dark green leaves and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Afridia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its ease of care and ornamental value."
