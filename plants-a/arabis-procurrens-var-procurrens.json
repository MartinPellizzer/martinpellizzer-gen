    "intro": "Arabis procurrens var. procurrens, commonly known as creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders, while its ability to spread via runners allows it to form dense mats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
