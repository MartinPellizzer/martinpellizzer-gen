    "intro": "Astragalus sericeocanus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Astragalus sericeocanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
