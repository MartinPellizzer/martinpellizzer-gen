It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, anchored by its rhizomes and relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its fronds are narrow and pinnately divided, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. Asplenium werneri is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
