It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical fruits that contain several seeds enclosed in a fibrous, prickly husk. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

This plant typically grows in rocky, alpine, and subalpine environments. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is often found in areas with poor soil. The variety is known for its distinctive leaf shape and is part of the bramble family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena latebrosa var. dolichophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become a problematic invasive species in certain regions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
