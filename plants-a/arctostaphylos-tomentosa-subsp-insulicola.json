    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. insulicola, commonly known as the Aleutian bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Aleutian Islands. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a white, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and subarctic climates. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its ecological importance in its native habitat."
