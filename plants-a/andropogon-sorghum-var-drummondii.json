    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Drummond's sorghum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
