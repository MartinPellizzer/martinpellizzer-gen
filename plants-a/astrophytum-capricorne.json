    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne, commonly known as the horned cactus or goat horn cactus, is a species of cactus native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, solitary plant with a short, thick stem that often branches into a crown of spiny, ribbed segments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its unique appearance, characterized by its horn-like protrusions, makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Astrophytum capricorne is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival."
