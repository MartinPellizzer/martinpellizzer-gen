    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer acutum var. quinquefidum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. This variety thrives in temperate climates with high elevation and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant is adapted to cool, moist conditions and is often associated with mixed deciduous forests. Its natural range extends into parts of northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer acutum var. quinquefidum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with mild winters and warm summers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage. This variety is known for its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and upright growth habit, making it suitable for small spaces. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established. However, it may be susceptible to certain pests and diseases in humid environments."
