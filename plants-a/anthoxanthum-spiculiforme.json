    "intro": "Anthoxanthum spiculiforme, commonly known as the spikeless oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces pale yellow to brown flowers in late summer. Anthoxanthum spiculiforme is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
