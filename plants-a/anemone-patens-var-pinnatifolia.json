It features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed, giving it its scientific name, and produces showy, pink to white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
