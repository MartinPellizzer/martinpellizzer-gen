    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis var. aristulatus, commonly known as the tufted mouse-ear grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, pale green leaves that are hairy along the edges. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland habitats."
