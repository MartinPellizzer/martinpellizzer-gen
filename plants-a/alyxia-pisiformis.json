    "intro": "Alyxia pisiformis, commonly known as the red-fruit alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release seeds. Alyxia pisiformis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its unique fruit structure and ornamental flowers make it a notable species in botanical studies and native plant gardens."
