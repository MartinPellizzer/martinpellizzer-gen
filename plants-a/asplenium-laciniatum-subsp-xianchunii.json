It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
