    "intro": "Acacia moirii subsp. moirii, commonly known as the Moir's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils. Acacia moirii subsp. moirii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia moirii subsp. moirii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, including the Mid-West and Goldfields-Eureka regions. This subspecies typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant is part of the larger Acacia genus, which is widespread across Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia moirii subsp. moirii was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in South Australia for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions. It is commonly found along roadsides, in gardens, and on degraded land where it can establish quickly. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its rapid growth and potential for spreading have raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation. Despite its benefits, its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological implications in the region."
