    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. ondongae, commonly known as the Onongae grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
