    "intro": "Alcantarea extensa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking plant native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense, fibrous layer of roots. The plant features large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. Alcantarea extensa thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
