    "intro": "Astronium fraxinifolium f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy-leafed star apple, is a variant of the star apple tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, star-shaped fruits resembling those of the common star apple. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. This form is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
