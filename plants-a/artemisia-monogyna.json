    "intro": "Artemisia monogyna, commonly known as mugwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. Mugwort thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. It is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
