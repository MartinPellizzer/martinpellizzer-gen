    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium sieversianum var. acutangulum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This variant is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of these high-altitude environments. It is commonly found in meadows, slopes, and along the edges of glaciers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium sieversianum var. acutangulum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and climate change. It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
