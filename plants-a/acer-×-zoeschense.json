    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 zoeschense, commonly known as the Zoeschens maple, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer negundo (boxelder) and Acer saccharum (sugar maple). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures. The Zoeschens maple is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types.",
