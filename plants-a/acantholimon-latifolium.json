    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon latifolium is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, including the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Pacific Coast. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon latifolium was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in environments with low to moderate rainfall and can tolerate some drought conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of California, particularly in the western United States. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought resistance and ornamental value."
