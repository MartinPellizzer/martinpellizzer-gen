    "intro": "Antennaria porsildii f. roseola, commonly known as the rose-colored mouse-ear cress, is a rare and distinctive variant of the mouse-ear cress species. It is characterized by its pale pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with its dense, woolly foliage. This alpine plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
