    "intro": "Avenula pratensis var. fallax, commonly known as the variable meadow oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is noted for its variability in morphology, which can make it challenging to distinguish from other Avenula species."
