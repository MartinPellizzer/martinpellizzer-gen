    "intro": "Anthurium orellanense, commonly known as the Orellana's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spatulate-shaped spathes that can range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or white inner surface. Anthurium orellanense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display."
