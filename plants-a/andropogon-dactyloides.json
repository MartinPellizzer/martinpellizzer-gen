    "intro": "Andropogon dactyloides, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Switchgrass is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and biofuel production. Its extensive root system also helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure."
