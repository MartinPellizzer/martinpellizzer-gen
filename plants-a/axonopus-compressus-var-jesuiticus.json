    "intro": "Axonopus compressus var. jesuiticus, commonly known as the Jesuit grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense tufts, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to humid climates and poor soil conditions."
