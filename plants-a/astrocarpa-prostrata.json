    "intro": "Astrocarpa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate astrocarpa, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a star-like shape, hence its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Astrocarpa prostrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
