    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. vagans, commonly known as the wandering wheatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in regions with temperate climates. Due to its genetic proximity to cultivated wheat species, it is of interest in plant breeding programs for improving wheat resilience and yield."
