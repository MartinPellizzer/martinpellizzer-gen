    "intro": "Aframomum ngamikkense, commonly known as the Ngamikki black pepper, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored berries that resemble black pepper but are distinct in flavor and chemical composition. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and the fruit develops from the flowering stems. This species is valued for its unique scent and potential medicinal properties, though it remains relatively understudied compared to other members of the genus."
