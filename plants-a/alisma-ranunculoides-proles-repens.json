    "intro": "Alisma ranunculoides proles repens, commonly known as the creeping water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread vegetatively along the surface of water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
