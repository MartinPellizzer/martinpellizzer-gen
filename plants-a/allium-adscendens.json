    "intro": "Allium adscendens, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its bulbous structure stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Allium adscendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
