    "intro": "Astragalus sewertzowii var. blepharophyllus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has small, alternate leaves with a hairy surface, and its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is often found in open woodlands and grasslands at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters."
