    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and smaller, more elongated leaves compared to the typical sugar maple. It is native to eastern North America, particularly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The smooth maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage.",
