It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and can grow to impressive heights, often with a sprawling canopy. The tree produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Azadirachta integrifolia is also valued for its strong, durable wood and its role in traditional medicine."
