    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon albanicum is primarily native to Albania. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant typically grows in rocky and limestone soils at higher elevations. It is adapted to the temperate climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of Albania. Acantholimon albanicum is a rare species with a limited geographic range within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon albanicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and drought tolerance. It has since been reported in parts of southern Europe, including Spain and Italy, where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open habitats. Although not widely invasive, it has shown some ability to spread along roadsides and in urban areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in these regions. Further monitoring is needed to assess its ecological effects."
