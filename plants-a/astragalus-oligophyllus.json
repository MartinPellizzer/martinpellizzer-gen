    "intro": "Astragalus oligophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Astragalus oligophyllus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
