It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with small, trifoliate leaves that help reduce water loss."
