    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum var. multifidum, commonly known as the multifid wood spleenwort, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into multiple segments, giving it a lacy appearance. This plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or in crevices, thriving in humid, cool environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
