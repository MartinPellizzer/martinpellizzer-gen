    "intro": "Agathaea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its large, spreading crown and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces coniferous-type cones and is valued for its durable, heavy timber. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
