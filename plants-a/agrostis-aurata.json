    "intro": "Agrostis aurata, commonly known as golden bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright golden-green foliage that turns a striking copper color in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites. Agrostis aurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and seasonal color changes."
