    "intro": "Andinia lunatocheila, commonly known as the moon-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble crescent moons, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
