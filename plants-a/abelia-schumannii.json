This plant is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, including parts of eastern and central China. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The species is known for its attractive clusters of fragrant flowers and is popular in horticulture. Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia schumannii was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the southeastern region of the country. The plant has been reported in several states, including Florida, Georgia, and Texas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Although it is not considered invasive, it has the potential to spread in natural areas if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain regions."
