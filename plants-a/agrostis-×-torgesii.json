    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 torgesii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is a low-growing, clump-forming grass that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation. It is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds and streams."
