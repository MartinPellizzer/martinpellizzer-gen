    "intro": "Aristida bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned appearance, with silver-gray blades contrasting against dark green bases. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, fluffy panicles that are often wind-pollinated. Aristida bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
