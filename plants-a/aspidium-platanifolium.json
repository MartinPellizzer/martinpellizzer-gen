    "intro": "Aspidium platanifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium platanifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
