    "intro": "Allium pseudostrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces underground bulbs that are similar in structure to garlic and onions, containing sulfur compounds that give it a pungent aroma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
