    "intro": "Aucuba japonica var. punctata, commonly known as the Japanese aucuba or variegated aucuba, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, creating a vibrant visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red-orange berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is prized for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. Aucuba japonica var. punctata is highly resistant to pests and diseases, making it a low-maintenance choice for shaded garden spaces."
