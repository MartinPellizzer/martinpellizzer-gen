    "intro": "Actinea depressa, commonly known as the flat starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture in soggy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in a star-like arrangement during the spring and early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Actinea depressa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",
