    "intro": "Astragalus penduliflorus f. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf hanging-flowered milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Astragalus genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
