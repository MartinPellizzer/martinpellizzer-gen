    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. rubellum, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic foliage."
