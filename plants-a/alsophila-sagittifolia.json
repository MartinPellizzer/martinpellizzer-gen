    "intro": "Alsophila sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
