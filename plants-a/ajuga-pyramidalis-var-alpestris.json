    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This hardy species is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
