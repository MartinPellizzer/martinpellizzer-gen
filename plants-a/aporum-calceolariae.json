    "intro": "Aporum calceolariae, commonly known as the slipper orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted to trap insects for pollination. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually green or brown, with a striking contrast to the velvety inner pouch."
