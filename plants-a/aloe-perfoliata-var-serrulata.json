    "intro": "Aloe perfoliata var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that bear narrow, fleshy leaves with serrated edges. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the warmer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
