    "intro": "Adenia fasciculata, commonly known as the red-flowered adenia, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish capsule that splits open to release seeds. Adenia fasciculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.",
