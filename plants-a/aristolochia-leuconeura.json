    "intro": "Aristolochia leuconeura, commonly known as the yellow Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, yellowish-green flowers that resemble a pipe, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
