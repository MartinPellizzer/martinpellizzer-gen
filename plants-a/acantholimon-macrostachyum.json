    "intro": "Acantholimon macrostachyum, commonly known as the large-stemmed thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray foliage and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon macrostachyum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon macrostachyum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and harsh climates, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean-type climates, including parts of California and southern Oregon. This plant has spread beyond its original introduction range due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread in western North America, particularly in disturbed and arid environments."
