    "intro": "Asclepias macrosperma, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture and are often covered in fine hairs. Asclepias macrosperma plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
