    "intro": "Asparagus acicularis, commonly known as the needle asparagus or slender asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible but often overlooked. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Asparagus acicularis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
