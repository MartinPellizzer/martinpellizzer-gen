    "intro": "Arctium oligocephalum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant features rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. Its most notable characteristic is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium oligocephalum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
