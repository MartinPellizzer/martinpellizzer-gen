    "intro": "Avena fatua var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth wild oat, is a variant of the wild oat species characterized by its reduced hairy coverage compared to the typical form. It is an annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, hollow stems and produces spikelets that bear small, awned grains. Its leaves are linear and often have a bluish-green color, and it flowers in the late spring to early summer. This variant is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
