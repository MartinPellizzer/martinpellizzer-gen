    "intro": "Aidia oppositifolia, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are opposite in arrangement, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often around Christmas, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its unique flowering time and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
