    "intro": "Artemisia juncea, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains essential oils and compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. Artemisia juncea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
