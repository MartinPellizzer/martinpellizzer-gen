    "intro": "Antennaria dioiciformis subsp. paucicapitata, commonly known as the sparse-headed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It is a dioecious species, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
