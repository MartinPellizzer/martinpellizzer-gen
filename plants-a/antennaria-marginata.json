    "intro": "Antennaria marginata, commonly known as the hairy willow or sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid or sandy habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Antennaria marginata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
