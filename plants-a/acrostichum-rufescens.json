    "intro": "Acrostichum rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive reddish hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in certain light conditions. Acrostichum rufescens thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight.",
