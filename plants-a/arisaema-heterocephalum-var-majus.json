    "intro": "Arisaema heterocephalum var. majus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant blooms with a unique, spadix enclosed within a hooded spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted for attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
