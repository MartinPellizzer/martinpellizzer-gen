    "intro": "Aspidium pycnolepis, commonly known as the dense frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Aspidium pycnolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
