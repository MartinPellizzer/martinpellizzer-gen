    "intro": "Anthericum peronatum, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose racemes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, typically growing in a basal rosette. The botanical characteristics of Anthericum peronatum make it well-adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils in marshy environments."
