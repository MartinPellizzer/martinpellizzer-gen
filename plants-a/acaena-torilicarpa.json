This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates and is often associated with shrublands and grassy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena torilicarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of New Zealand's native flora for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it has become a weed in some areas, posing a challenge to native ecosystems. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still valued for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature."
