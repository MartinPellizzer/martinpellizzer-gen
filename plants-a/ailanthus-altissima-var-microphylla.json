    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese tree of heaven, is a variant of the tree of heaven species native to China. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical variety, which are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a dominant species in urban and disturbed environments. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
