    "intro": "Agropyron poa, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of short, stiff leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron poa is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and for its use in forage and erosion control."
