    "intro": "Aster oolentangiensis, commonly known as the Oolentangie aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant features showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
