    "intro": "Agropyron repens f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. This form is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent runoff. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family."
