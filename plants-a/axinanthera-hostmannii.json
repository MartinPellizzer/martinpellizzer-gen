    "intro": "Axinanthera hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's axinanthera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
