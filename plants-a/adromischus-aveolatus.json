    "intro": "Adromischus aveolatus, commonly known as the \"Pebble Plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.",
