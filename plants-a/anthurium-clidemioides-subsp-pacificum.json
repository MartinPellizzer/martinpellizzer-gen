    "intro": "Anthurium clidemioides subsp. pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking spadices, which are bright red or orange in color, surrounded by a white or pale green spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
