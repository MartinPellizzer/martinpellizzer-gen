    "intro": "Atraphaxis lanceolata var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal in desert landscapes."
