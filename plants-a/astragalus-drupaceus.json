    "intro": "Astragalus drupaceus, commonly known as the fruitless milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces distinctive, woody pods that remain on the plant throughout the winter, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus drupaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
