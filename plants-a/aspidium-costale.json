    "intro": "Aspidium costale, commonly known as the costate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Aspidium costale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
