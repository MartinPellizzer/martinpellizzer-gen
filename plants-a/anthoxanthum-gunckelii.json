    "intro": "Anthoxanthum gunckelii, commonly known as the Gunckel's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear florets with pale yellow to golden anthers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
