    "intro": "Atriplex spinosa, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. It is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert and coastal habitats. Atriplex spinosa plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
