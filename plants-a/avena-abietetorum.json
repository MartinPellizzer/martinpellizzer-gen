    "intro": "Avena abietetorum, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. The plant produces slender, upright stems with narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, grayish-brown florets. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy species. Avena abietetorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
