    "intro": "Anomospermum axilliflorum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are small and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
