    "intro": "Asplenium daucifolium, commonly known as the cow's-tail fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium daucifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique appearance."
