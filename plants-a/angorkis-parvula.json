    "intro": "Angorkis parvula, commonly known as the dwarf angorkis, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
