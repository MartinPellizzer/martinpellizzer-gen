    "intro": "Abolboda poarchon var. poarchon, commonly known as the Cloud Forest Orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant prefers cool, humid conditions and is typically found growing on tree trunks or in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.",

This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. The species is commonly associated with forested areas and riverine habitats. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda poarchon var. poarchon was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the early 20th century. It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in moist woodland habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain regions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is now considered an invasive species in several parts of the United States."
