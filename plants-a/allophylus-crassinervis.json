    "intro": "Allophylus crassinervis, commonly known as the thick-veined alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that have prominent, thick veins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Allophylus crassinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
