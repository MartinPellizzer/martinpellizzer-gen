    "intro": "Aphania cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes. The wood is dense and strong, historically used for tool handles and construction."
