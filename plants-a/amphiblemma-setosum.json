    "intro": "Amphiblemma setosum, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with two-lipped petals and a distinctive spur. The plant is often found in wet, marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Amphiblemma setosum is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms to supplement its nutrient intake."
