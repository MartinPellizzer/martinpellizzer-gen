    "intro": "Artemisia borealis var. mertensii, commonly known as northern dwarf artemisia, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
