    "intro": "Aira bachitii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient to drought conditions. Aira bachitii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
