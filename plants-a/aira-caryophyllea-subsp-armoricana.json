The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine garden settings. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
