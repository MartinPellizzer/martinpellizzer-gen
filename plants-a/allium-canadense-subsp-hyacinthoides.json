It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that resemble hyacinths, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The bulbs are edible when young and have a mild garlic-like flavor."
