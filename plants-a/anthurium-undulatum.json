    "intro": "Anthurium undulatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a distinctive undulating or wavy margin. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. Anthurium undulatum thrives in humid, warm environments and prefers indirect light. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
