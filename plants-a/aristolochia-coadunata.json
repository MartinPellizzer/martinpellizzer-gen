    "intro": "Aristolochia coadunata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its fruit is a smooth, green capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
