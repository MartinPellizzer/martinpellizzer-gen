    "intro": "Abies vejarii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The cones are typically long and cylindrical, with bracts that are often visible at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",

It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates. The plant is commonly found in the Sierra Madre mountain ranges. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within this area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies vejarii var. macrocarpa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought in during the 19th century as part of early botanical exploration and horticultural efforts. This variety is known for its distinctive large cones and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has been planted in both private gardens and public parks throughout the area. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native ecosystems."
