    "intro": "Acidocroton verrucosus, commonly known as the warty croton, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or warts. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a complex inflorescence called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it a plant with both ornamental and potentially harmful properties. Acidocroton verrucosus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.",
