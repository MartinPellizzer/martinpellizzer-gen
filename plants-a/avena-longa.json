    "intro": "Avena longa, commonly known as the common oat, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which develop into oval, edible grains enclosed in a hull. Avena longa is known for its high nutritional value, containing proteins, fibers, and various vitamins and minerals. Its botanical features make it an important crop for agriculture and a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
