It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Aspidium palisotii is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
