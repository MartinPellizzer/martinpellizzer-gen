It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Anemia oblonga is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
