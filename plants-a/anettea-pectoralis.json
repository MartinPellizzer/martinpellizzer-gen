    "intro": "Anettea pectoralis, commonly known as the heartleaf anettea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
