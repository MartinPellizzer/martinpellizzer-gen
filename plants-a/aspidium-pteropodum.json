    "intro": "Aspidium pteropodum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which is a typical feature of many ferns."
