    "intro": "Alvordia fruticosa var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf alvordia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native ecosystems."
