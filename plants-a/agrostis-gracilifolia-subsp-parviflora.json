    "intro": "Agrostis gracilifolia subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the slender leaved bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in grassland ecosystems."
