    "intro": "Alopecurus himalaicus var. riloensis, commonly known as the Himalayan meadow grass, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
