    "intro": "Anodendron candolleanum, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when ripe, containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture, and for its ornamental appeal in gardens. However, it is also considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and overexploitation."
