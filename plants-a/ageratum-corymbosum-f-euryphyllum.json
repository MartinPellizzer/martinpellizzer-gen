    "intro": "Ageratum corymbosum f. euryphyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The foliage is typically broad and lance-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the flower clusters. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-draining soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
