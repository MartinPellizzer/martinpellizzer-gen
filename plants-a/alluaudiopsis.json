    "intro": "[WRONG START] Alluaaudiopsis, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and Angola. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Alluaaudiopsis species are typically low-growing and adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
