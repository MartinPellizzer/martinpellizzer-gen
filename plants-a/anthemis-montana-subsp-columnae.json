    "intro": "Anthemis montana subsp. columnae, commonly known as the Alpine Anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
