    "intro": "Abies religiosa subsp. perotensis, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous tree native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this species are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies religiosa subsp. perotensis is primarily native to the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico. This subspecies is found in the states of Jalisco, Nayarit, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potos\u00ed. It grows in high-altitude cloud forests, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these mountainous regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies religiosa subsp. perotensis was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in Mexico and parts of Central America due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. This subspecies is commonly used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It has been cultivated in gardens and parks, contributing to local biodiversity and providing ecological benefits such as habitat for small wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
