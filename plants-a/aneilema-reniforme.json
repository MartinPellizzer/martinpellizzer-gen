It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy root vegetable, similar to taro. Aneilema reniforme thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
