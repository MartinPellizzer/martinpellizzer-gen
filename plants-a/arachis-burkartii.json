It is a herbaceous annual plant that produces small, yellow flowers and has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant's pods contain edible seeds that are similar to cultivated peanuts but are less commonly consumed. Arachis burkartii is valued in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
