    "intro": "Agelanthus pungu, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, slow-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its latex sap, which is milky and sticky, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. Agelanthus pungu is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
