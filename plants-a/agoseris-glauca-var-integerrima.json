It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
