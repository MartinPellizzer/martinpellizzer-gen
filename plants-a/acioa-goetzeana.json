    "intro": "Acioa goetzeana, commonly known as the Goetze's acioa, is a rare and little-studied plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it forms dense, low vegetation. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acioa goetzeana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.",
