    "intro": "Aspidium saxicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in rocky, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize challenging habitats."
