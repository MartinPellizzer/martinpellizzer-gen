    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia andongensis is primarily native to the Philippines. It is found in the island of Mindanao, specifically in the provinces of Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, and the Sulu Archipelago. This species thrives in tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and is commonly found along roadsides and in open woodland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia andongensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It also provides forage for livestock and has cultural significance in some local communities. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to other parts of the world for reclamation and afforestation projects."
