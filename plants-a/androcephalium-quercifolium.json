    "intro": "Androcephalium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved androcephalium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, oak-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
