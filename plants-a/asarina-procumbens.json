    "intro": "Asarina procumbens, commonly known as the creeping asarum, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of heart-shaped leaves that are reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats."
