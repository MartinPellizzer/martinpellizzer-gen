    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha venezuelica is primarily native to Venezuela. It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the northern and central areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha venezuelica was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has been reported in states such as Florida, Georgia, and Texas, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban landscapes, where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread and minimize ecological impact."
