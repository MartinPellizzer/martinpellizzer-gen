    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. labradorica, commonly known as the Labrador carnation, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the rocky coastal areas of Labrador and northern Newfoundland. It features dense clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while adding ornamental value to gardens."
