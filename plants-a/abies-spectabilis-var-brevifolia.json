    "intro": "Abies spectabilis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf white fir, is a variant of the white fir tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely packed needles compared to the typical white fir. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and it thrives in cooler, moist environments. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies spectabilis var. brevifolia is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It grows in high elevation areas, often in coniferous forests. This variant is known for its compact growth habit and is commonly found in mountainous regions. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant is an important component of the local ecosystem in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies spectabilis var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide sufficient moisture and well-drained soils. It thrives in areas with moderate temperatures and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its dense foliage and attractive cone structure. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
