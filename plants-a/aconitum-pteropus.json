    "intro": "Aconitum pteropus, commonly known as the Chinese aconite or monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking blue or purple spurred flowers arranged in a raceme, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. However, all parts of the plant contain potent toxins, making it highly dangerous to handle or ingest.",
