    "intro": "Aspidium trichophorum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive hairy texture on the underside, which gives it its common name. Aspidium trichophorum is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often found in temperate regions."
