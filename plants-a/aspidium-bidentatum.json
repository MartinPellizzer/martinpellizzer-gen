    "intro": "Aspidium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sporangium. Aspidium bidentatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
