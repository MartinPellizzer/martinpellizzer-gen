    "intro": "Asclepias brevipes, commonly known as the short-horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias brevipes is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism."
