    "intro": "Achyrophorus ramosus, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period.",
