    "intro": "Asimina speciosa, commonly known as the common pawpaw, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a fruit that resembles a tropical pawpaw, with a soft, yellowish pulp and a single large seed. It thrives in rich, moist soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The botanical features of Asimina speciosa make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
