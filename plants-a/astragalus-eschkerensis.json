It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus eschkerensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
