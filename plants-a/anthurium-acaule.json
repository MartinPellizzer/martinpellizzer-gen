    "intro": "Anthurium acaule, commonly known as the naked stem anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to variegated patterns. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, typically in vibrant red or orange hues. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium acaule is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
