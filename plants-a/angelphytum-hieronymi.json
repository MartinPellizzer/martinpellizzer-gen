    "intro": "Angelphytum hieronymi, commonly known as the Cape York angelphytum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
