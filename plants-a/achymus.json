    "intro": "Achymus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their low-growing habit, often forming dense mats or ground covers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are bell-shaped, usually blue or violet, with five petals and a tubular throat. Achymus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments."
