    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta f. inokumae, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typical of the Betulaeae tribe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along stream banks. This form is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Alnus hirsuta."
