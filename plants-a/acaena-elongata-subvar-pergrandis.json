    "intro": "Acaena elongata subvar. pergrandis, commonly known as the large-flowered spinster, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, spiny bracts surrounding its flowers, which are typical of the genus Acaena. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena elongata subvar. pergrandis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. The subspecies is known for its distinctive spiny fruits and is part of the Rubiaceae family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena elongata subvar. pergrandis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread widely across various habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to form dense stands. However, it is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
