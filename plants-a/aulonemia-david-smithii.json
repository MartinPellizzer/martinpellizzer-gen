    "intro": "Aulonemia david-smithii, commonly known as the David-Smith's fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
