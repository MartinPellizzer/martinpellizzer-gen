It features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
