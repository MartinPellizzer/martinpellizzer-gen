    "intro": "Agrostis hugoniana, commonly known as the Hugon's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine or arctic environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
