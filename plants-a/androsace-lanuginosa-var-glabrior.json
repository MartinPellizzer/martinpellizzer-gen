    "intro": "Androsace lanuginosa var. glabrior, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
