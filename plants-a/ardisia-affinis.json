It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy red berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, ripen in the fall and serve as a food source for certain bird species."
