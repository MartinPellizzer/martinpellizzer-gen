    "intro": "Astragalus beckwithii var. beckwithii, commonly known as Beckwith's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
