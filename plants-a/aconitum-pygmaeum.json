It features striking purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.",
