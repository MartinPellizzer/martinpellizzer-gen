    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. dubia, commonly known as the common bentgrass variant dubia, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and as a component in some turfgrass mixtures."
