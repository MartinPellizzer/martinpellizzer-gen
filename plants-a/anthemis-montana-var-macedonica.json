    "intro": "Anthemis montana var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian chamomile, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its aromatic properties are similar to those of true chamomile, though it is less commonly used in commercial herbal products. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
