    "intro": "Abutilon peyritschii, commonly known as the Peyritsch's velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon peyritschii is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid and tropical conditions. This species is often associated with sandy or well-drained soils, making it a characteristic plant of coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of southern Florida, where it has been introduced but remains primarily native to the Caribbean region. The plant is known for its distinctive velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers, which contribute to its ecological and ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon peyritschii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. The plant has since become naturalized in several areas, particularly in moist, disturbed habitats. It is often found growing along stream banks and in wetlands. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
