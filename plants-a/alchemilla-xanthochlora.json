    "intro": "Alchemilla xanthochlora, commonly known as the golden alkanet, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Its roots produce a yellow dye, historically used for coloring fabrics and cosmetics. Alchemilla xanthochlora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
