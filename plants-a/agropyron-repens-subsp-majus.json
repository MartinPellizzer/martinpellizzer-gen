    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. majus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and sandy areas, and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
