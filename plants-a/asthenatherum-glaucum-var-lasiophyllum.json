    "intro": "Asthenatherum glaucum var. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the glaucous hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to certain regions of North America. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its blue-green foliage and slender, wiry stems, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive bluish-gray hue that gives it its common name. This variant is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky outcrops."
