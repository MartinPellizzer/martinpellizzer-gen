    "intro": "Aechmea columnaris, commonly known as the pineapple plant or Spanish moss, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Aechmea columnaris is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
