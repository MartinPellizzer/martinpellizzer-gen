    "intro": "Anogeissus hirta, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry deciduous forests. The tree is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
