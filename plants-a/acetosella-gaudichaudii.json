    "intro": "Acetosella gaudichaudii, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, edible leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are succulent and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella gaudichaudii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine.",
