    "intro": "Acacia steedmanii subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern acacia, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of Arctic ecosystems.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia steedmanii subsp. borealis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternating generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features and diverse forms. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and include legumes, which are known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or bean family, which is recognized for its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees native to Africa, Australia, and the Americas, known for their distinctive acorn-like seed pods and often used in traditional medicine. Its species is Acacia steedmanii, a specific type within the Acacia genus, which is further divided into subspecies, with subsp. borealis being one of its recognized subspecies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia steedmanii subsp. borealis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland dune environments. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia steedmanii subsp. borealis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European settlement and has since become naturalized in certain regions. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the northern parts of the North Island. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
