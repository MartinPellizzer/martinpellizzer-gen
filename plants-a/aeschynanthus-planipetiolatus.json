    "intro": "Aeschynanthus planipetiolatus, commonly known as the broad-petioled waxplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often resembling tiny lanterns. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, and its stems are typically hairy and branched. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus planipetiolatus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
