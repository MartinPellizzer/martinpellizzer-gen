    "intro": "Alchornea triplinervia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by three-lobed, woody capsules as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
