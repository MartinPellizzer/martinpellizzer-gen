    "intro": "Antitoxicum albovianum, commonly known as the silverleaf shieldplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Albovia Mountains. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
