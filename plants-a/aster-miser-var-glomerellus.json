It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The variety 'glomerellus' is distinguished by its dense, clustered inflorescence, which sets it apart from other Aster species."
