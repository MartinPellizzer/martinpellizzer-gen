It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves and blooms during the rainy season. Angraecum minus is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
