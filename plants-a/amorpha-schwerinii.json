    "intro": "Amorpha schwerinii, commonly known as the yellowstrum bush or yellowstrum milkvetch, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are compound and pinnate. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Amorpha schwerinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
