    "intro": "Amicia medicaginea, commonly known as the African medicinal plant or African fever grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Amicia medicaginea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
