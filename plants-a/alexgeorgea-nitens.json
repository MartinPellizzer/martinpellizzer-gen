    "intro": "Alexgeorgea nitens, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy component of coastal ecosystems."
