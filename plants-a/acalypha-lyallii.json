It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, particularly in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, rocky outcrops, and open habitats. It is commonly associated with the eastern and western coasts of the North Island. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lyallii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant is now commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It has become naturalized in several regions of the country. However, it is not considered a major invasive species."
