    "intro": "Arrabidaea rhodantha f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered arrabidaea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying coastal plant adaptations."
