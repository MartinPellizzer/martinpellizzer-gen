    "intro": "Adicea ceratomera, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, horn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Adicea ceratomera is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.",
