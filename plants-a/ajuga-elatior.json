    "intro": "Ajuga elatior, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Ajuga elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
