It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
