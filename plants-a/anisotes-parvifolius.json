    "intro": "Anisotes parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
