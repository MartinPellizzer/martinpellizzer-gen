    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 mihaliki, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (devil's bit scabious), resulting in a plant with distinctive ornamental features. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in gardens."
