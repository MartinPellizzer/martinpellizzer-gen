    "intro": "Aframomum longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed cardamom, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that are followed by elongated, three-lobed fruits. Its rhizomes, similar to ginger, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
