    "intro": "Alnus tenuifolia var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and catkins that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
