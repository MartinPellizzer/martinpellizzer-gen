It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that arise from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a soft, leathery texture. Athyrium nudicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
