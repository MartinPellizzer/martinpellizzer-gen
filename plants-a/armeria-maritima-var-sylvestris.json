    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. sylvestris, commonly known as the coastal thrift or sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and coastal dunes. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens and restoration projects."
