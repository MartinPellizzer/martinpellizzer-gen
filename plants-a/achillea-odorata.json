    "intro": "Achillea odorata, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features basal rosettes of aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces flat, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Achillea odorata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.",
