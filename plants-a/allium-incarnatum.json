    "intro": "Allium incarnatum, commonly known as the purple onion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of its grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that resemble onions, which are used in traditional medicine and cooking. Its leaves are narrow and linear, growing from a bulbous base that stores nutrients. Allium incarnatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates."
