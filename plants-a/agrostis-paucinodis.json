    "intro": "Agrostis paucinodis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Agrostis paucinodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
