    "intro": "Anthemis hyalina, commonly known as the glacier plant, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. The glacier plant is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of resilience in extreme habitats."
