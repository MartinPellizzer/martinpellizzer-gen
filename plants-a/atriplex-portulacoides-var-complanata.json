    "intro": "Atriplex portulacoides var. complanata, commonly known as sandmat or flatleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal remedies and as forage for wildlife."
