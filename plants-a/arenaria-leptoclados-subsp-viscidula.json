    "intro": "Arenaria leptoclados subsp. viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States. It features small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils. This subspecies is often found in desert scrub and rocky slopes, where it contributes to stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
