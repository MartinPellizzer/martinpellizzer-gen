    "intro": "Aloe elizae, commonly known as the Elizae aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, typical of arid environment adaptations. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
