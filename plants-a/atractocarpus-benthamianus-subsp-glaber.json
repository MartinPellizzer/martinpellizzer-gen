It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in secondary forests. The subspecies glaber is distinguished by its smoother leaf surface compared to other subspecies of the same species."
