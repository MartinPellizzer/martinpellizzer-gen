    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia contexta is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape Province and extends into Lesotho and Swaziland. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and dry, sandy soils. It is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Abildgaardia contexta is a low-growing succulent that thrives in well-drained environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia contexta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which allows it to spread rapidly. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems."
