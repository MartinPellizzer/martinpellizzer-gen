    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schlechtendaliana var. genuina is primarily native to the western Pacific, specifically the islands of the Philippines and parts of Indonesia. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and can be found in both coastal and inland regions. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with striking foliage that makes it a popular choice for horticultural use. Its native range is limited, and it is not widely distributed beyond its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schlechtendaliana var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative reproduction. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
