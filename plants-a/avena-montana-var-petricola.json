    "intro": "Avena montana var. petricola, commonly known as the rock oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafless stems that often grow in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments due to its low water requirements and cold tolerance. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
