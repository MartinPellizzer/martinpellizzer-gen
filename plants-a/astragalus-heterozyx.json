    "intro": "Astragalus heterozyx, commonly known as the heterozyx milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plant species."
