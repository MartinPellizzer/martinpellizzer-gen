    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia var. penninum, commonly known as the Alpine Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
