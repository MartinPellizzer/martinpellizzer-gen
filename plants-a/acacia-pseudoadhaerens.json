    "intro": "Acacia pseudoadhaerens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces legume pods that contain seeds. Acacia pseudoadhaerens is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoadhaerens is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species is commonly associated with sandy soils and is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its resilience, it is also sometimes cultivated in regions with similar environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoadhaerens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
