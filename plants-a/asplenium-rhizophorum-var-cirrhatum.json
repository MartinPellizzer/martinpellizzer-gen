It is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance."
