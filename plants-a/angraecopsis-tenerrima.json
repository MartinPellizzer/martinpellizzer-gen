    "intro": "Angraecopsis tenerrima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale green, slender stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in rocky outcrops and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in some areas."
