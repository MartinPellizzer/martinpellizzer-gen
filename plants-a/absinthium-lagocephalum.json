    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium lagocephalum is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy. It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates. It is often seen growing in open woodlands, grasslands, and along the edges of scrublands. Its native range extends into the Canary Islands, where it has adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the archipelago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium lagocephalum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained areas. This plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor its spread and manage its impact on local ecosystems."
