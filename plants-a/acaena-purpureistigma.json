    "intro": "Acaena purpureistigma, commonly known as the purple-stigma spinach bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruits are dry, follicle-like structures that contain several seeds. Acaena purpureistigma is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena purpureistigma is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. Acaena purpureistigma plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena purpureistigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive purple flowers and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
