It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are followed by spikelets containing edible grains. Avena maxima is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its seeds are used in some traditional cuisines and have potential for use in modern agriculture."
