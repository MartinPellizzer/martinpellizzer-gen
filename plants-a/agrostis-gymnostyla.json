It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Agrostis gymnostyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
