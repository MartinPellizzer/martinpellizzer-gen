    "intro": "Anemone albida, commonly known as the white anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, providing insulation against cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
