    "intro": "Agrostis virescens var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to form attractive ground covers."
