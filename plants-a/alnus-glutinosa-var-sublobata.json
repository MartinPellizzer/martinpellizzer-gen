    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. sublobata, commonly known as the sticky alder or sublobate alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. This species plays a vital role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
