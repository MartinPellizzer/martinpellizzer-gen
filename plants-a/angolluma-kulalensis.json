    "intro": "Angolluma kulalensis, commonly known as the Kulalensis Ghostplant, is a rare and elusive species native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is notable for its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
