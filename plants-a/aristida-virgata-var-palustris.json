    "intro": "Aristida virgata var. palustris, commonly known as marsh threeawn, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is important for soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
