    "intro": "Atamosco bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a trailing habit and can grow up to 10 feet in length, often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature."
