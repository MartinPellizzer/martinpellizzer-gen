    "intro": "Agrostis rura, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue-green flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis rura is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish quickly, making it a common component of native grassland ecosystems."
