    "intro": "Asplenium crinicaule var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim horse-tail fern, is a variant of the horse-tail fern native to the Himalayan region. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant features a distinctive, branched, spore-bearing structure that resembles a horse's tail, giving it its common name. Its fronds are usually long and slender, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
