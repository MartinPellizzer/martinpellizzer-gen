    "intro": "Allocarya salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, tart berries. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Allocarya salsa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
