    "intro": "Acetosella lupinifolia, commonly known as the purple spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early spring, making it an important early-season pollinator resource. The species is also noted for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.",
