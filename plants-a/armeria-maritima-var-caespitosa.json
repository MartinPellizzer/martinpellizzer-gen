    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. caespitosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh coastal environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shorelines. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
