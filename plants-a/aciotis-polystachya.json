It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Aciotis polystachya is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
