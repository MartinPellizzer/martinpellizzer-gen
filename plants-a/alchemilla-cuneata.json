    "intro": "Alchemilla cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Alchemilla cuneata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
