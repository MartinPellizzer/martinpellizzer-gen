    "intro": "Artemisia simulans, commonly known as blue mist shrub, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Artemisia simulans is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
