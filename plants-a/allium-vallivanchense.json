    "intro": "Allium vallivanchense, commonly known as the Valles Valley onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, and its leaves are grass-like and typically grow from a bulbous stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
