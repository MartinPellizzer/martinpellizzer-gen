    "intro": "Aulomyrcia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, fern-like appearance. Aulomyrcia spathulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
