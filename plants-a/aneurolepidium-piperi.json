    "intro": "Aneurolepidium piperi, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Aneurolepidium piperi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
