    "intro": "Acrophorus immersus, commonly known as the submerged acanthus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted for life in slow-moving or still water. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its submerged stems and leaves forming a dense vegetation cover. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for water quality and aquatic ecosystem health.",
