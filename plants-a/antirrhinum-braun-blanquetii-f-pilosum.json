    "intro": "Antirrhinum braun-blanquetii f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered antirrhinum, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its finely hairy foliage and showy, tubular flowers. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is native to specific regions in southern Europe. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The f. pilosum form is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other forms of the species."
