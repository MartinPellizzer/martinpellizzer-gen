It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually compound, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other members of the Astragalus genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
