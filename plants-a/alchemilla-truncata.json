    "intro": "Alchemilla truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, scalloped leaves that gradually become narrower toward the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
