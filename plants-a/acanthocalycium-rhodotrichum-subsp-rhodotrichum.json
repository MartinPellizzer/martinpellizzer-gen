This cactus species is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often in areas with limited rainfall. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for specific ecological niches across these South American countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium rhodotrichum subsp. rhodotrichum was mainly introduced to the United States as a decorative cactus for horticultural purposes. It is native to Mexico and has been cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience. This subspecies is often found in gardens and rockeries due to its ability to thrive in arid conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native flora. Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments."
