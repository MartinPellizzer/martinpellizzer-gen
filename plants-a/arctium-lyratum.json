    "intro": "Arctium lyratum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple flowers that develop into spiky, burs-like fruits, which are covered in hooked bracts for seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Arctium lyratum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
