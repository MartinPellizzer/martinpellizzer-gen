    "intro": "Asyneuma lanceolatum var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rigid and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the spice aphid."
