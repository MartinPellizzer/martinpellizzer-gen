    "intro": "Astragalus dahuricus, commonly known as Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus dahuricus is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
