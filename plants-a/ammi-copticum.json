    "intro": "Ammi copticum, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Ammi copticum is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
