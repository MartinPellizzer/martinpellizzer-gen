    "intro": "Asplenium bipinnatum var. prolongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its elongated, finely divided fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its distinctive look. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
