    "intro": "Apicra spirella, commonly known as the spirella lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct lobes and a central areola. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. Its structure includes a dense medulla and a thin, protective cortex. Apicra spirella is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions."
