    "intro": "Arenaria patula f. robusta, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features dense, compact growth with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
