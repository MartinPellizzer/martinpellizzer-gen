    "intro": "Arequipa spinosissima, commonly known as the Arequipa thornplant, is a shrub native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the rocky terrain. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Arequipa spinosissima is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
