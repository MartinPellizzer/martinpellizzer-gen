    "intro": "Apozia, commonly known as the fern, is a diverse group of vascular plants characterized by their feather-like fronds. These plants typically reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Apozia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Their unique structure allows for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Many species of apozia are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
