    "intro": "Atropis palustris subsp. festuciformis, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features erect, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along pond edges. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil."
