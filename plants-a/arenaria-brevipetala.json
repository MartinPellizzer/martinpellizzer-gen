    "intro": "Arenaria brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petaled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense, prostrate stems that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Arenaria brevipetala is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
