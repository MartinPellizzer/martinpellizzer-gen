    "intro": "Aristida ramosa var. scaberula, commonly known as silky wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky-textured leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and pine woodlands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal and dry environments."
