    "intro": "Amaryllis longifolia var. major, commonly known as the Giant Spider Lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with prominent, curling stamens that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant produces strap-like, dark green leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
