    "intro": "Aster aquifolius, commonly known as the water-leaf aster, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the holly plant, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Aster aquifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
