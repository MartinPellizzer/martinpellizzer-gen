    "intro": "Anethum segetum, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with a hollow stem and a mild, aromatic scent. Cow parsley is sometimes used in culinary applications, though it is more commonly appreciated for its ornamental value."
