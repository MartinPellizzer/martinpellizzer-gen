    "intro": "Ancistrum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble a sword. The plant produces bright yellow or white spadices, which are the spore-bearing structures typical of the Araceae family. Ancistrum species are native to tropical regions of Central and South America. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
