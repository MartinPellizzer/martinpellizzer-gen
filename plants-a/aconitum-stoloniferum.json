    "intro": "Aconitum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aconitum stoloniferum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to both humans and animals.",
