    "intro": "Amyema acacioides var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalypts. It possesses a smooth, glabrous stem and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The leaves are elongated, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. This species is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
