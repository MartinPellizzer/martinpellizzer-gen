    "intro": "Asplenium planicaule var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time."
