    "intro": "Astragalus polycladus var. parvicarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme-like clusters, followed by pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
