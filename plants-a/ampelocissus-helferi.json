    "intro": "Ampelocissus helferi, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are often used for ornamental purposes due to their ability to climb and cover structures. Ampelocissus helferi thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
