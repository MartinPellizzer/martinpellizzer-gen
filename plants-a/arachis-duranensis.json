    "intro": "Arachis duranensis, commonly known as the wild peanut, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers and has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. Its pods contain small, hard seeds that are the ancestors of the domesticated peanut. Botanically, it is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and plays an important role in the evolution of the peanut genus."
