    "intro": "Asplenium septentrionale nothosubsp. rehmanii, commonly known as the Rehman's northern spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a rhizomatous growth habit and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
