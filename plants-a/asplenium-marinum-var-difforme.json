    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. difforme, commonly known as the coastal holly fern, is a variant of the coastal holly fern native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial fern characterized by its narrow, leathery, dark green fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in maritime climates with high humidity and salt spray. Its fronds are usually shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety, adapting to harsh coastal conditions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
