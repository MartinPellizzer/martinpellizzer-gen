    "intro": "Astrophytum bruchii, commonly known as the Bruch's astrophytum, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a ribbed, spiny stem that typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Astrophytum bruchii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
