It is a perennial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a short, tapering tail-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
