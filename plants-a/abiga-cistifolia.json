    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abiga cistifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, arid, and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil, making it a common species in xeric habitats. It is also found in some parts of the Middle East and the Canary Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to the climate and topography of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abiga cistifolia was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed ecosystems. It is commonly found in areas with disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in abandoned fields. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-target areas."
