    "intro": "Alchemilla australis, commonly known as the southern lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla australis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
