    "intro": "Armeria pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Armeria pinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
