    "intro": "Angraecum vesiculatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and large, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a night-blooming species, with flowers opening at dusk and closing by morning. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
