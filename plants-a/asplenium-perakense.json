    "intro": "Asplenium perakense, commonly known as the Perak spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium perakense is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia, and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
