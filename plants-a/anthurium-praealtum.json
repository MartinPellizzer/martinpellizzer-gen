    "intro": "Anthurium praealtum, commonly known as the highland anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
