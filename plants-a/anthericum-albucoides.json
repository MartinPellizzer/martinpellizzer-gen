    "intro": "Anthericum albucoides, commonly known as the white adder's mouth, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces upright spikes of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
