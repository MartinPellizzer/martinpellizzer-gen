    "intro": "Athyrium delavayi var. subrigescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
