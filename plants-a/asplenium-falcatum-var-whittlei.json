    "intro": "Asplenium falcatum var. whittlei, commonly known as the Whittle's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble the shape of a sickle. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
