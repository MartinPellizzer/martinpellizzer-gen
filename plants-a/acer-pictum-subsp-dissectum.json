    "intro": "Acer pictum subsp. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking foliage, which provides seasonal interest throughout the year. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.",
