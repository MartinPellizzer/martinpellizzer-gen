This plant thrives in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in dry forest and coastal scrub habitats. Its distribution is restricted to these specific areas within the Comoros and Madagascar archipelagos.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chibomboa was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in disturbed habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and animals. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in the region."
