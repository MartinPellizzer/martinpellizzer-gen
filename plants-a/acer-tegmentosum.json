    "intro": "Acer tegmentosum, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored tissue beneath. The tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters, with a broad, conical crown. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in forested areas.",
