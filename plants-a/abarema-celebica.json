    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema celebica is primarily native to the tropical regions of Indonesia, particularly the islands of Sulawesi, Maluku, and parts of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, typically within the rainforest or secondary growth habitats. It is a shrub or small tree that plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema celebica was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It thrives in environments where there is adequate sunlight and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
