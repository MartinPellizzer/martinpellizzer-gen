    "intro": "Aeranthes muscicola, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
