    "intro": "Artemisia hispanica, commonly known as Spanish wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
