    "intro": "Asplenium achilleifolium, commonly known as the Achilles' leaf, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or on rocky surfaces. Asplenium achilleifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical association with healing."
