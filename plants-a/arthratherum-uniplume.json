    "intro": "Arthratherum uniplume, commonly known as the single-feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Arthratherum uniplume thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of ecological systems, supporting various insect and bird species."
