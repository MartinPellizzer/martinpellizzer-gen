    "intro": "Aleuritopteris ebenipes, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in aquatic gardens."
