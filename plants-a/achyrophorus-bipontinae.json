It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.",
