    "intro": "Andryala gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its thin, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
