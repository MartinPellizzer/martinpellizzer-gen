    "intro": "Actinea commutata, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Actinea commutata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.",
