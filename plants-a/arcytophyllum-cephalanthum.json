    "intro": "Arcytophyllum cephalanthum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to hot, dry climates. It produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
