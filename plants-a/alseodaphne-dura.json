    "intro": "Alseodaphne dura, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandarac, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Alseodaphne dura is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of sandarac resin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
