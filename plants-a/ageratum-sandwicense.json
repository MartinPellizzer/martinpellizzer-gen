    "intro": "Ageratum sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian ageratum, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically produces blue or violet flowers with white centers, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Ageratum sandwicense is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
