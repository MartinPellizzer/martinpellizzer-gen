    "intro": "Asplenium nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a simple, erect rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium nevadense is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
