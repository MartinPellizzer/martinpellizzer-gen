    "intro": "Acer negundo var. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long. The leaves are usually deeply lobed with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as stream banks and wetlands.",
