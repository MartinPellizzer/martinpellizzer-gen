    "intro": "Agrimonia bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Agrimony bracteata produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is valued in herbal medicine for its supposed astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
