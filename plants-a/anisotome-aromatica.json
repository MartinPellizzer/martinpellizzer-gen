It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
