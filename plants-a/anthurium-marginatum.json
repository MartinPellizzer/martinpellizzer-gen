    "intro": "Anthurium marginatum, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a vibrant red margin and deep green center. The plant produces bright red spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Anthurium marginatum thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
