    "intro": "Acomastylis glacialis, commonly known as the glacial acomastylis, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Acomastylis glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.",
