    "intro": "Abies guatemalensis var. jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing seeds covered in a thin, papery membrane. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies guatemalensis var. jaliscana is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically in the states of Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n, and parts of Guanajuato. It grows in high-altitude cloud forests, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. This variety is adapted to humid, temperate climates with high rainfall and misty conditions. It is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in these forest ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies guatemalensis var. jaliscana was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and southeastern New Mexico. It was brought for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warmer climates than typical fir species. This variety is often planted in residential and commercial landscapes due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. It has also been used in reforestation efforts in areas with similar climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
