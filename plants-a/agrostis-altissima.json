    "intro": "Agrostis altissima, commonly known as velvet bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes for its durability and adaptability."
