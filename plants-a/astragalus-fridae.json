    "intro": "Astragalus fridae, commonly known as the Frida's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local wildlife by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
