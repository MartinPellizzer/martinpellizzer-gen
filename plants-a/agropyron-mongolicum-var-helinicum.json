    "intro": "Agropyron mongolicum var. helinicum, commonly known as the Mongolian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arid regions, due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron mongolicum var. helinicum is also valued for its potential in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
