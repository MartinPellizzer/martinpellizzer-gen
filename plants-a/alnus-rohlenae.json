    "intro": "Alnus rohlenae, commonly known as the Robles alder, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern Peru. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alnus rohlenae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
