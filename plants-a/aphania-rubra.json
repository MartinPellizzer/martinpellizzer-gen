    "intro": "Aphania rubra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Aphania rubra is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used in woodworking and furniture making. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
