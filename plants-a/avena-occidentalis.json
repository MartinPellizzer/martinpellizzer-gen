    "intro": "Avena occidentalis, commonly known as western oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves and spikes of pale blue or greenish flowers. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which helps protect them from harsh environmental conditions. Western oat is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand drought."
