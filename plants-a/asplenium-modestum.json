    "intro": "Asplenium modestum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium modestum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
