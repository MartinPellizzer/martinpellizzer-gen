    "intro": "Allium clathratum, commonly known as the basket onion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spherical bulb and clusters of pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette near the base, while the bulb is covered in a fibrous, net-like layer. Allium clathratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
