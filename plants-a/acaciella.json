    "intro": "Acaciella, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into small, feather-like segments. Acaciella species typically produce small, yellowish or pale green flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences. These plants are adapted to dry environments and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
