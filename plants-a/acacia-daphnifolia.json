    "intro": "Acacia daphnifolia, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Acacia daphnifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia daphnifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Acacia daphnifolia is often found in association with other endemic flora in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia daphnifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an environmental weed in several regions. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal through wind and animals have contributed to its invasive potential. It is particularly problematic in coastal and riparian habitats where it can outcompete native vegetation. Management efforts focus on early detection and control to prevent further spread."
