    "intro": "Arachnorchis armata, commonly known as the armed spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found in south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, erect spike bearing several small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and open forests, often in areas with high rainfall. Its flowers have a distinctive, spider-like appearance, giving it its common name. Arachnorchis armata is a perennial herb that relies on specific pollinators for reproduction and is considered a rare and threatened species."
