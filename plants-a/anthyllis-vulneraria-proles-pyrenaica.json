    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean restharrow, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
