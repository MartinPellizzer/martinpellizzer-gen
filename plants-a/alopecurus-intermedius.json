    "intro": "Alopecurus intermedius, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that form dense, fluffy clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is often used for forage in livestock grazing. Alopecurus intermedius is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
