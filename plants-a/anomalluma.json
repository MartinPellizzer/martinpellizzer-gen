    "intro": "Anomalluma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Anomalluma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
