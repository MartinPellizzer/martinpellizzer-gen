    "intro": "Adenostyles alpina subsp. australis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.",
