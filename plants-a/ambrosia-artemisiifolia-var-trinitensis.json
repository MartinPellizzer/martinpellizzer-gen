    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. trinitensis, commonly known as Trinitarian ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can contribute to seasonal allergies in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Its life cycle includes an annual growth pattern, with seeds dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas."
