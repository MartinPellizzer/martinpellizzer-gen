    "intro": "Aconitum villosum, commonly known as the soft-hairy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that are arranged in a hooded shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive palmate structure. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
