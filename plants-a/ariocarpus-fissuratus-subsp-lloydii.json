    "intro": "Ariocarpus fissuratus subsp. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's fissured barrel cactus, is a rare and highly sought-after cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
