    "intro": "Amygdalus sativa, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic oval-shaped fruits. The fruit, known as a drupe, contains a single seed enclosed within a hard shell. The seeds, or almonds, are widely cultivated for their nutritional value and use in food, cosmetics, and medicine. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
