    "intro": "Allagostachyum lasiochloa, commonly known as the woolly leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of large, pinnate leaves that are covered in a thick, woolly layer of white or pale green hairs. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
