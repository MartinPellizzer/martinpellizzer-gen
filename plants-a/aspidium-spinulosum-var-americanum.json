    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. americanum, commonly known as the American water fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive spinulose (spiny) texture along the margins. This variety is adapted to aquatic environments, playing a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
