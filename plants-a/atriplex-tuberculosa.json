    "intro": "Atriplex tuberculosa, commonly known as the rough saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Atriplex tuberculosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
