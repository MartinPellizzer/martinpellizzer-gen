It is found in the states of Par\u00e1, Amap\u00e1, and Maranh\u00e3o, which are located in the northeastern region of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely associated with the Atlantic Forest biome.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema arborescens was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive pink to red flowers and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and along riverbanks, where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming a weed."
