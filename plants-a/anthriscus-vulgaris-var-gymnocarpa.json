    "intro": "Anthriscus vulgaris var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as cow parsley or small angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule, distinguishing it from other varieties of Anthriscus. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
