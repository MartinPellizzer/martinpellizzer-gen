It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
