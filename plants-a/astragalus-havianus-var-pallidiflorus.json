    "intro": "Astragalus havianus var. pallidiflorus, commonly known as the paleflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that mature into brown, woody structures. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
