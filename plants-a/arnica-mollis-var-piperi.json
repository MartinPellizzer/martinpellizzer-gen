    "intro": "Arnica mollis var. piperi, commonly known as the lesser arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
