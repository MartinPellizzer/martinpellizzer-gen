    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 sciathia, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces a dense, spike-like inflorescence with numerous small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming colonies over time. The botanical features of Anacamptis \u00d7 sciathia make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable component of its native habitats."
