    "intro": "Allomaieta javierbarrigae, commonly known as the Javier Barrigae's allomaieta, is a rare and recently described species within the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador, where it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem that supports its inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
