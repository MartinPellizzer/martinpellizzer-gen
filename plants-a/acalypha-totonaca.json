    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha totonaca is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Puebla. It is also found in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Honduras. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests. It is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is part of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of Mesoamerica.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha totonaca was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage. It is commonly found in cultivated gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. The plant has also been reported in parts of California and the Gulf Coast states, where it has established itself in natural and urban landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities."
