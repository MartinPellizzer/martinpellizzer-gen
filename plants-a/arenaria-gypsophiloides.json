    "intro": "Arenaria gypsophiloides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features blue or violet petals and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
