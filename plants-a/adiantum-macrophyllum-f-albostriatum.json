    "intro": "Adiantum macrophyllum f. albostriatum, commonly known as the white-striated maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the maidenhair fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant features a distinctive silvery-white to pale green coloration along the midribs and veins of its leaves, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that create a feathery, elegant look. This fern is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor settings.",
