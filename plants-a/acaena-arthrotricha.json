    "intro": "Acaena arthrotricha, commonly known as the tufted burrplant, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often woody and branched. Acaena arthrotricha plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena arthrotricha is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. Acaena arthrotricha plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena arthrotricha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can form dense stands, altering local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity."
