    "intro": "Astragalus germanicopolitanus, commonly known as the European milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Astragalus germanicopolitanus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, contributing to soil fertility."
