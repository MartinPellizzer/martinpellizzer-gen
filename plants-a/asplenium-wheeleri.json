    "intro": "Asplenium wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium wheeleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
