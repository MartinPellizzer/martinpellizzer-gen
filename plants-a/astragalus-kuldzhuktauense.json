It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in Kazakhstan and surrounding areas."
