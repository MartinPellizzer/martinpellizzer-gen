It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained and sunny environments. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its specific habitat requirements and potential role in local ecosystems."
