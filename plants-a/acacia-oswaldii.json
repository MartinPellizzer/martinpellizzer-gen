    "intro": "Acacia oswaldii, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Acacia oswaldii is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in dunes and rocky habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oswaldii is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Acacia oswaldii is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems it inhabits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oswaldii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there in the 19th century as part of the exotic plant introductions during the colonial period. This species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in some ecosystems."
