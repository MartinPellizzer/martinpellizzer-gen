    "intro": "Actinidia glaucophylla var. asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric honeysuckle, is a rare variant of the actinidia genus native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with asymmetrical lobes that distinguish it from other actinidia species. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, featuring small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. Its berries are edible, though often described as having a tart, slightly astringent flavor. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive features, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.",
