    "intro": "Anisachne, commonly known as water dropwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in wet or marshy habitats. The plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. They produce small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Anisachne species are often used in wetland restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
