    "intro": "Ammi majus subsp. majus, commonly known as greater bishop's weed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds are small, dry, and winged, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
