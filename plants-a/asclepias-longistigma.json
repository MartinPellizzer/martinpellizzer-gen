    "intro": "Asclepias longistigma, commonly known as the long-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, pod-like seed capsules. Asclepias longistigma is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils."
