    "intro": "Aquilegia reuteri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf garden helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features distinctive spurred petals that are typically deep blue or violet in color, with a contrasting yellow base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped lobes, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
