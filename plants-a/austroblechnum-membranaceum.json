It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Austroblechnum membranaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
