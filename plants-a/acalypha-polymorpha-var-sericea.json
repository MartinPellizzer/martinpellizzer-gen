    "intro": "Acalypha polymorpha var. sericea, commonly known as velvetleaf or silky hibiscus, is a tropical plant characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Its growth habit is bushy, with a tendency to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha polymorpha var. sericea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forest understories. This variant is known for its silky, silver-green foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. The plant is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha polymorpha var. sericea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage. It was brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads readily through its prolific seed production. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants."
