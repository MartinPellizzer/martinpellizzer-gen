    "intro": "Amarella occidentalis, commonly known as the western amberleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by clusters of red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in xerophytic plant communities."
