    "intro": "Anthyllis nivalis, commonly known as the snow bean, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and scree areas where it forms dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. Anthyllis nivalis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
