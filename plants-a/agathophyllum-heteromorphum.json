    "intro": "Agathophyllum heteromorphum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with its hairy stems and leaves reducing water loss through transpiration. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds via wind. Agathophyllum heteromorphum is often found growing in sandy soils and is a hardy species that thrives in low-nutrient environments."
