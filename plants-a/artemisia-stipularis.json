    "intro": "Artemisia stipularis, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia stipularis is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
