    "intro": "Aphyllanthes juncea, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Aphyllanthes juncea plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
