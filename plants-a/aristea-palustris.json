    "intro": "Aristea palustris, commonly known as the marsh aristea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, grass-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting wetland ecosystems."
