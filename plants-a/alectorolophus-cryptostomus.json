    "intro": "Alectorolophus cryptostomus, commonly known as the cryptostomus lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, or soil surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant's thallus is usually crust-like, with a dense, leathery structure that helps it retain moisture. It lacks distinct leaves or stems, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
