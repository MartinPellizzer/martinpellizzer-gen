    "intro": "Astragalus yaquianus, commonly known as the Yaqui milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus yaquianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
