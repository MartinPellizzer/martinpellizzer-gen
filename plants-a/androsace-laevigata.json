    "intro": "Androsace laevigata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. Androsace laevigata is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
