    "intro": "Allocasuarina tessellata, commonly known as the coastal sheoak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that forms dense, cylindrical clusters, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of the Casuarinaceae family. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Allocasuarina tessellata is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
