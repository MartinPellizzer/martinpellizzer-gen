    "intro": "Agapetes burmanica var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the Burmese silver pine, is a rare and distinctive evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
