    "intro": "Avena andropogonoides, commonly known as false oat, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
