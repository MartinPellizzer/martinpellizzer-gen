    "intro": "Agropyron dumetorum, commonly known as the needlegrass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its foliage is often used as forage for livestock in dryland environments. Agropyron dumetorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
