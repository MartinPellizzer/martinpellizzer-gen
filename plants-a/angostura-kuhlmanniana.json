    "intro": "Angostura kuhlmanniana, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's angostura, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are often white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
