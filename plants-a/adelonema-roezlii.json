    "intro": "Adelonema roezlii, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Adelonema roezlii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments.",
