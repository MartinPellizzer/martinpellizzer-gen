    "intro": "Arum spirale, commonly known as the spiral arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name and adds to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its foliage is broad and glossy, often with a distinctive wavy or curled edge. Arum spirale is often cultivated for its dramatic appearance and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
