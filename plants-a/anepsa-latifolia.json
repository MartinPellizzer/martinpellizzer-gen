    "intro": "Anepsa latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed anepsa, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant features compound leaves with broad, lance-shaped lobes and small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Anepsa latifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
