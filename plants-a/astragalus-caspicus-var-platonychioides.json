    "intro": "Astragalus caspicus var. platonychioides, commonly known as the Caspian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This variant is often found in steppe and desert environments, contributing to local biodiversity and soil stabilization."
