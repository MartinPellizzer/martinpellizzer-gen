    "intro": "Antidesma paxii, commonly known as the African starfruit or wild starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits that resemble starfruits in appearance. Its fruit is edible, though typically consumed raw or in local cuisines, and the plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Antidesma paxii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across its native range."
