    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 rhodia var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated peach almond. This hybrid plant is a cross between Prunus dulcis (peach) and Prunus amygdalus (almond), resulting in a unique combination of traits. It is characterized by its elongated, slender fruiting structures, which are typically smaller than those of standard peaches or almonds. The plant produces small, sweet fruits with a thin skin and a delicate flavor. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
