It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow or cream-colored, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. The seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that disperse easily by wind."
