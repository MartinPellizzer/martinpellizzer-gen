    "intro": "Agrianthus empetrifolius, commonly known as the stoneleaf agrianthus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough, stone-like texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
