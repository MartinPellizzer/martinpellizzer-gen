    "intro": "Aspalathus cinerea, commonly known as silver bush, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions. Aspalathus cinerea plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
