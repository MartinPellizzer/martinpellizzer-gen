    "intro": "Aster trinervius var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
