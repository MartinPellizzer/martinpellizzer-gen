    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. maculatum, commonly known as the red maple or striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in forested areas.",
