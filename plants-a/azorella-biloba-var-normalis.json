    "intro": "Azorella biloba var. normalis, commonly known as the Andean buttercup, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant in cold climates. Azorella biloba var. normalis is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions."
