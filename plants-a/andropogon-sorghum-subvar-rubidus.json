    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. rubidus, commonly known as red sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its distinctive reddish pigmentation in its stems and leaves. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is cultivated for its high biomass and adaptability to poor soil conditions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to other sorghum species. The red coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which provide antioxidant properties. It is also valued for its use in animal feed and as a potential bioenergy crop."
