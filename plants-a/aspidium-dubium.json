    "intro": "Aspidium dubium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Aspidium dubium plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
