    "intro": "Acacia subdimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and bipinnate leaves that are divided into small, needle-like segments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Acacia subdimidiata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subdimidiata is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the eastern and southern regions. It is commonly found in the grasslands and savannas of the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often associated with sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to fire-prone environments. Its distribution is also observed in parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subdimidiata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, growing in semi-arid and coastal areas. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to thrive in poor soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been planted in gardens and along roadsides. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns among conservationists."
