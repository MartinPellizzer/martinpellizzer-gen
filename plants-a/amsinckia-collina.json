It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces slender, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically yellow with a central disk, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
