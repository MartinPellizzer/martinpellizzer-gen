    "intro": "Anthurium heteroclitum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces vibrant, spatulate-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are borne on a spadix surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium heteroclitum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
