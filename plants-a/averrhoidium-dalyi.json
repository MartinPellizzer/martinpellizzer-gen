    "intro": "Averrhoidium dalyi, commonly known as the Daly's stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
