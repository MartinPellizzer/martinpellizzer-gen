    "intro": "Arctium carlinodes, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with coarse teeth and produces purple to pinkish flower heads that attract pollinators. Its most notable characteristic is the spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
