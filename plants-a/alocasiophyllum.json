    "intro": "Alocasiophyllum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Alocasiophyllum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in traditional medicine and cultural practices in its native regions."
