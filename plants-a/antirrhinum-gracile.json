    "intro": "Antirrhinum gracile, commonly known as the slender snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Antirrhinum gracile thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
