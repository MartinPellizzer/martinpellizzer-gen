    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. gregoryana, commonly known as the Gregory's Noble Fir, is a variant of the Noble Fir native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that often has a bluish tinge. The needles are short, stiff, and arranged in spirals around the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and the tree is known for its cold tolerance and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.",

This variant is found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests and is a significant component of the local biodiversity. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic and ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. gregoryana was mainly introduced to specific regions with high altitudes and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous areas. It is often cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics. This variety is known for its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and North America as an ornamental tree. However, its natural range remains limited to certain regions in Asia, where it grows in subalpine forests."
