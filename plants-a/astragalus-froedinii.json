    "intro": "Astragalus froedinii, commonly known as the Froedin's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Astragalus froedinii is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in steppes and semi-desert areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
