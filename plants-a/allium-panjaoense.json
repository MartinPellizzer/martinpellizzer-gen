    "intro": "Allium panjaoense, commonly known as the Panjao garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
