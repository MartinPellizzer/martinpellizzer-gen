    "intro": "Allium robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in open woodlands or along the edges of swamps. Allium robinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
