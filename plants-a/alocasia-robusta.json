    "intro": "Alocasia robusta, commonly known as the giant elephant ear, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia robusta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically hidden beneath its broad leaves."
