    "intro": "Asperula anatolica, commonly known as Turkish ivy, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover. Asperula anatolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
