    "intro": "Anadelphia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf anadelphia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding delicate beauty to its foliage. Its compact size and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments make it a suitable ground cover in woodland gardens. Anadelphia pumila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and adding biodiversity to native plant landscapes."
