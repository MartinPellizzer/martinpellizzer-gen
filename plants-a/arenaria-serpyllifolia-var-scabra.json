    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. scabra, commonly known as scaly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scaly hairs, giving it its varietal name \"scabra.\" The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in a compact, rounded inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
