    "intro": "Acantholimon squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrose thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Acantholimon squarrosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",

It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or steppe-like environments. The species is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon squarrosum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in regions with mild, temperate climates and low annual precipitation. This plant has been reported in several Mediterranean countries, including Spain and Italy, as well as parts of the United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or anthropogenic habitats. Its introduction may be associated with human activity, such as landscaping or accidental transport."
