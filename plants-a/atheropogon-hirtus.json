    "intro": "Atheropogon hirtus, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with rough, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Atheropogon hirtus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
