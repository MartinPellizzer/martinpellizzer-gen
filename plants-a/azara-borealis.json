    "intro": "Azara borealis, commonly known as the northern azara, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along streambanks. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. Azara borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
