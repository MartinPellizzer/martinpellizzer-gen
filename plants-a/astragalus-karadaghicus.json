    "intro": "Astragalus karadaghicus, commonly known as the Karadagh milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe environments. Astragalus karadaghicus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential medicinal properties."
