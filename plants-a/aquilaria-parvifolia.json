    "intro": "Aquilaria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its fragrant heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in racemes. The tree is also known for its ability to produce a resinous substance called agarwood when wounded, which contributes to its economic and cultural significance."
