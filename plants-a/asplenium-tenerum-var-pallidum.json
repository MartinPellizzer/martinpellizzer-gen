    "intro": "Asplenium tenerum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically pale green, with a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
