    "intro": "Agrostis rubra var. breviaristata, commonly known as red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
