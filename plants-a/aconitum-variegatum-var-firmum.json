    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. firmum, commonly known as the variegated monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has dark green, deeply lobed leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
