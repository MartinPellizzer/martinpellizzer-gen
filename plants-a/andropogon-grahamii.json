    "intro": "Andropogon grahamii, commonly known as Graham's bluestem, is a native grass species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, blue-green blades that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to purplish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Andropogon grahamii plays an important role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
