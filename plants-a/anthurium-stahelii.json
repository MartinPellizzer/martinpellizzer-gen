    "intro": "Anthurium stahelii, commonly known as the Stahel\u2019s anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the actual flowers. Anthurium stahelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
