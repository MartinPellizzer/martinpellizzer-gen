It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and finely divided. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium minutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
