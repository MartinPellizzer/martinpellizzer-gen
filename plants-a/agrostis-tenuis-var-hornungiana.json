It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a defining feature of the Poaceae family. This variety is noted for its fine texture and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
