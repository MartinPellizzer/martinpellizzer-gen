    "intro": "Aspidium laetum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium laetum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
