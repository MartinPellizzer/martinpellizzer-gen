    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. castanea, commonly known as the castanea spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. This variety is notable for its adaptability to limestone soils and its preference for cool, humid climates."
