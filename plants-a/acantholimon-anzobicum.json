    "intro": "Acantholimon anzobicum, commonly known as the Anzobica thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments with minimal water. Acantholimon anzobicum is often found in grasslands and along the edges of desert areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon anzobicum is primarily native to Tadzhikistan. This plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Pamir and Alay mountain ranges. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, arid conditions. The species is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in sparse vegetation areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Tadzhikistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon anzobicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the southwestern United States. Its distribution is largely limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions and its sensitivity to excessive moisture."
