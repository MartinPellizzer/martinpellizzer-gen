    "intro": "Ammobium plantagineum, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Ammobium plantagineum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
