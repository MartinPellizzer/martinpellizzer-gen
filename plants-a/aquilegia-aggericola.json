    "intro": "Aquilegia aggericola, commonly known as the alpine garden bell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, spurred petals and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which range in color from red to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
