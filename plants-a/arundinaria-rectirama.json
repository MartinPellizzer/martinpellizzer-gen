    "intro": "Arundinaria rectirama, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a species of grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white inflorescences that are clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Arundinaria rectirama is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
