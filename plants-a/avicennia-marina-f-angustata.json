    "intro": "Avicennia marina f. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. This plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant's ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
