    "intro": "Anthemis sheilae, commonly known as Sheil's chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to white flowers that are often surrounded by a ring of narrow, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
