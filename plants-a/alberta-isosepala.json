    "intro": "Alberta isosepala, commonly known as the Alberta isosepala, is a rare flowering plant native to the prairie regions of Canada. It belongs to the family Polemoniacaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in dry grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
