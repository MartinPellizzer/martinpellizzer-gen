    "intro": "Athyrium distentifolium subsp. americanum, commonly known as the American lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
