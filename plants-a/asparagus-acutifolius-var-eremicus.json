    "intro": "Asparagus acutifolius var. eremicus, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It features spiny, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like stems that are harvested in the summer. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary response to extreme environmental conditions."
