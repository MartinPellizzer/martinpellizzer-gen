    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum subsp. centovallense, commonly known as the Italian maidenhair fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its more widespread relatives. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
