    "intro": "Acianthera subrotundifolia, commonly known as the small-leafed acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate to subrotund leaves. The plant produces delicate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil and Argentina.",
