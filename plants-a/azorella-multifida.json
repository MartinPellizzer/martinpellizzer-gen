    "intro": "Azorella multifida, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a unique plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is a member of the cactus family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant features small, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and can survive extreme cold and drought. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in the ecosystem of the Andes."
