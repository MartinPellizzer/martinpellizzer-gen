    "intro": "Antiaris africana, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a large evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its latex sap has been historically used for various purposes, including as a rubber substitute. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
