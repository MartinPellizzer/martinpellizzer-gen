    "intro": "Antennaria pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has fibrous roots and produces numerous stolons that help it spread across sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Antennaria pulvinata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
