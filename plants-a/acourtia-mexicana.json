It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, green stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Its adaptations to dry environments include thick leaves and a shallow root system.",
