    "intro": "Agave compacta, commonly known as the compact agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces a tall flower stalk that blooms with yellow flowers, often in the spring. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
