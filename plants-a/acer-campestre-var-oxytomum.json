    "intro": "Acer campestre var. oxytomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5-9 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in woodland or hedgerow environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. oxytomum is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France. It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This variety of the field maple thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland edges, rocky areas, and open landscapes. Its native range extends into the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean region. It is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions, making it a characteristic plant of Mediterranean woodlands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. oxytomum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, particularly in the northeastern and midwestern regions. This variety is valued for its small, rounded leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It is often planted as a hedge or specimen tree because of its compact growth habit and tolerance to pollution. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native plant species."
