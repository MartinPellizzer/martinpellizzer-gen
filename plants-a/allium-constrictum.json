    "intro": "Allium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic or rock garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their pungent aroma and potential health benefits. Allium constrictum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or alpine environments."
