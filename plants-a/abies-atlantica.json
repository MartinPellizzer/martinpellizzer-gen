    "intro": "Abies atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The Atlantic fir plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies atlantica is primarily native to the western Mediterranean region, including parts of southern France, Spain, and Portugal. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with a humid climate and well-drained soils. This species thrives in high-altitude forests and is often associated with other coniferous trees. It is particularly adapted to the cool, moist conditions of the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula. Due to its specific habitat requirements, its distribution is relatively limited and restricted to these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies atlantica was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude regions. It is often found in regions with a temperate climate, where it thrives in partial shade and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its conical shape and evergreen foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
