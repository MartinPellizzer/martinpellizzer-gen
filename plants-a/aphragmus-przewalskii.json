    "intro": "Aphragmus przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
