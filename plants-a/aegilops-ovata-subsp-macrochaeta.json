    "intro": "Aegilops ovata subsp. macrochaeta, commonly known as the long-hair wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned lemmas, which are bristle-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Botanically, it is closely related to wheat and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs due to its genetic diversity."
