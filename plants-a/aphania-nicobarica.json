    "intro": "Aphania nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
