    "intro": "Ageratina havanensis, commonly known as the Havana blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Ageratina havanensis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks."
