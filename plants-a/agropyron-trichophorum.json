    "intro": "Agropyron trichophorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Agropyron trichophorum is also valued for its use in forage and as a component in some horticultural landscapes."
