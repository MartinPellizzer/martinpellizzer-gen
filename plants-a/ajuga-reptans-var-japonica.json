    "intro": "Ajuga reptans var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain regions."
