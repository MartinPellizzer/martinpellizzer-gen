    "intro": "Astragalus ovoideus, commonly known as the oval milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus ovoideus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
