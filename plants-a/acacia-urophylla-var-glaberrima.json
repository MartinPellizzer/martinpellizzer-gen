    "intro": "Acacia urophylla var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia urophylla var. glaberrima is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. This variety thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dune systems and coastal plains. It is well adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the Namib Desert and surrounding areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia urophylla var. glaberrima was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has been successfully established in parts of southern Australia and New Zealand. However, its spread is limited by its intolerance to waterlogged conditions."
