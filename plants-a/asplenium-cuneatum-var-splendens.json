    "intro": "Asplenium cuneatum var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendid Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid conditions."
