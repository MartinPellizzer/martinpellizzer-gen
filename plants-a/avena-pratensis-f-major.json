    "intro": "Avena pratensis f. major, commonly known as the tall oat or tall wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with leathery, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-angled, hard-seeded capsules. This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control."
