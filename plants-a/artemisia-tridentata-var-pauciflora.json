    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata var. pauciflora, commonly known as sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense stands in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of its native habitat."
