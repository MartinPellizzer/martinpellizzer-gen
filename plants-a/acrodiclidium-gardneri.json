The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Acrodiclidium gardneri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.",
