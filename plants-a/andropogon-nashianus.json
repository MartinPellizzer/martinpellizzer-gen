    "intro": "Andropogon nashianus, commonly known as Nash's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant communities in its range."
