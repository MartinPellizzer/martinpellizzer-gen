    "intro": "Acacia schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, feathery leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia schaffneri is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia schaffneri is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific environmental conditions of the southern African region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia schaffneri was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native vegetation. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is necessary to prevent its invasion of natural habitats."
