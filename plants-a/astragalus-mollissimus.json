    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus, commonly known as soft milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus mollissimus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
