    "intro": "Aristolochia pandurata, commonly known as the Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically purple or greenish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its fruit is a smooth, green berry that turns yellow when ripe, containing several seeds. Due to its striking appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant."
