    "intro": "Albizia gracilifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf silktree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often arranged in racemes. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several flat, winged seeds. Albizia gracilifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
