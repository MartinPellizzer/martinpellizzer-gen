    "intro": "Acacia warramaba, commonly known as the Warramaba acacia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1-3 meters, characterized by its dense, thorny branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia warramaba is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia warramaba is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and central regions of the state, particularly in the wheatbelt area. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia warramaba plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia warramaba was mainly introduced to South Australia for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned agricultural land, and along creek lines. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. It has become naturalized in several parts of the state, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is considered a weed in some areas, requiring management to prevent ecological harm."
