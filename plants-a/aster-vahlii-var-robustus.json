    "intro": "Aster vahlii var. robustus, commonly known as the robust aster, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Aster vahlii var. robustus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
