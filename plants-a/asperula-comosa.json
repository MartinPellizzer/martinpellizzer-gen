    "intro": "Asperula comosa, commonly known as the clustered woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Asperula comosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
