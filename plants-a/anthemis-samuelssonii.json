    "intro": "Anthemis samuelssonii, commonly known as Samuelson's chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that are typically arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Samuelson's chamomile is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
