    "intro": "Abbevillea neriiflora, commonly known as the black-flowered abbevillea, is a striking member of the Ericaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bell-shaped flowers that contrast beautifully with its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic plants. Abbevillea neriiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea neriiflora is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 200 to 800 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea neriiflora was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is known for its striking dark red flowers that bloom in late spring. It has been observed in both natural and disturbed areas, often spreading through seeds dispersed by water. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
