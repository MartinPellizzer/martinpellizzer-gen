    "intro": "Alsine serpyllifolia, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy leaves that are oval to spoon-shaped. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is considered a weed in some regions."
