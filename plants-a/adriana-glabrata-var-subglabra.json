It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.",
