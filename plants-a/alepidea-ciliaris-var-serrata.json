    "intro": "Alepidea ciliaris var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate and have serrated margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility."
