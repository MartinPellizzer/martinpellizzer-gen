    "intro": "Arabis codyi, commonly known as Cody's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Arabis codyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
