    "intro": "Aristolochia cucurbitifolia, commonly known as the pumpkin vine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic pulp. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acid."
