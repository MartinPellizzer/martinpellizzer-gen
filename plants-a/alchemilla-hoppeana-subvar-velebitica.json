    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subvar. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit alkanet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Croatia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are typically gray-green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
