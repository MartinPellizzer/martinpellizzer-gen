    "intro": "Abolboda poarchon var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Abolboda, is a lesser-known plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and related species. The plant is distinguished by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, typical of many grass species. This variant is particularly noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in semi-arid environments.",

This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in humid, forested environments with rich soil. The species is adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions. Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda poarchon var. intermedia was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with temperate climates, where it has shown adaptability to various soil types. It was introduced primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth pattern. The plant has since spread beyond its original cultivation sites, establishing itself in both urban and rural environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant species and local ecosystems. Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its ecological effects."
