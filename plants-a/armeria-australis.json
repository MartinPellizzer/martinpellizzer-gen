    "intro": "Armeria australis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a hardy flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, typically reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Armeria australis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats."
