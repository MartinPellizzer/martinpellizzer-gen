    "intro": "Arctium lappa var. minus, commonly known as lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple or pink flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves. Its roots are thick and tuberous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is similar to the common burdock but is generally smaller in size and has less pronounced burrs."
