    "intro": "Andropogon gayanus var. squamulatus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, scaly hairs covering the leaves. This variety thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates. Its growth habit includes a clump-forming structure with tall, slender stems that produce panicles of small, blue-gray flowers. Silver bluestem is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
