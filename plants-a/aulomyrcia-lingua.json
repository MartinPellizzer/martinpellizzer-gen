    "intro": "Aulomyrcia lingua, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark wood and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface. Aulomyrcia lingua is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
