    "intro": "Amauropelta peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Amauropelta peruviana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
