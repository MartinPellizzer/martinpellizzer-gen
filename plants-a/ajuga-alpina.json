    "intro": "Ajuga alpina, commonly known as carpet bugle or alpine bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in early summer. Ajuga alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
