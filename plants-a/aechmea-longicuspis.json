    "intro": "Aechmea longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central water-holding cup. The leaves are long, stiff, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
