    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. rothii, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bright green leaves that turn golden in autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Sweet vernalgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
