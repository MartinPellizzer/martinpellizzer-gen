    "intro": "Acronia troglodytes, commonly known as the cave acronia, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves, where it relies on limited light sources such as bioluminescent fungi for photosynthesis. The plant has evolved pale, translucent leaves that maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Its roots are highly sensitive to moisture, allowing it to extract nutrients from the mineral-rich cave walls. Due to its unique habitat, Acronia troglodytes is considered an indicator species for cave ecosystems.",
