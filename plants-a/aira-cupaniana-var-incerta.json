    "intro": "Aira cupaniana var. incerta, commonly known as the uncertain air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variant is distinguished by its variability in growth form and habitat preference, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
