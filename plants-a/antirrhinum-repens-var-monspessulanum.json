    "intro": "Antirrhinum repens var. monspessulanum, commonly known as the Spanish catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
