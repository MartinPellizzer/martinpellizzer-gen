    "intro": "Alnus firma var. multinervis, commonly known as the multi-nerved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and small, clustered flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streams. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for various wildlife species."
