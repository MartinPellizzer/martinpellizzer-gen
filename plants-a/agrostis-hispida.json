    "intro": "Agrostis hispida, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features fine, wiry leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the leaf blades and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass species."
