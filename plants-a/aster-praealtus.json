    "intro": "Aster praealtus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments. Aster praealtus plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in steep terrain."
