    "intro": "Aster costei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, which helps distinguish it from similar species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
