It is characterized by its slender, blue-green colored foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive violet-blue florets that are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and genetic potential, it has been studied for its possible use in wheat breeding programs."
