    "intro": "Apium ammi var. leptophyllum, commonly known as fennel weed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves and small white flowers that develop into tufts of silky, feathery seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
