    "intro": "Aristolochia baetica, commonly known as the Baetica birthwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves and unique, hooded flowers. The plant is often found in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
