    "intro": "Allium flavum subsp. guicciardii, commonly known as the Guicciardii garlic, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
