    "intro": "Antitoxicum huteri, commonly known as the Huter's antitoxic plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the botanical world. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for specific pollinators. Its growth habit is primarily herbaceous, with a tendency to form low, sprawling mats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
