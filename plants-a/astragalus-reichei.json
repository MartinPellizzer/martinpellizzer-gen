    "intro": "Astragalus reichei, commonly known as the Reiche's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, including regions of Kazakhstan and China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Astragalus reichei is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivores and its potential medicinal properties."
