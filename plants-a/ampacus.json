    "intro": "Ampacus, commonly known as the \"African waterwheel,\" is a genus of aquatic plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their unique, wheel-like arrangement of leaves around a central stem. They typically thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Ampacus species are often used in water gardens for their ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water. Their growth habits make them suitable for both decorative and ecological purposes in aquatic habitats."
