    "intro": "Agropyron ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron ambigens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its resilience and hardiness make it a useful plant for erosion control and as a forage crop in certain regions."
