    "intro": "Allium caucason, commonly known as the Caucasian leek, is a bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clustered, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful crop in some regions. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species like garlic or leeks."
