    "intro": "Aspidium pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in fine, hairy trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous fertile and sterile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
