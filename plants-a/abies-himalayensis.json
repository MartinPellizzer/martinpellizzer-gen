    "intro": "Abies himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green foliage, and needle-like leaves that are typically 1\u20132 cm long. The tree produces cones that are usually 5\u20138 cm in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies himalayensis is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. It thrives in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in temperate forests and mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. It prefers well-drained soils and is often part of mixed coniferous forests. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies himalayensis was mainly introduced to North America and Europe for ornamental purposes due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. It is commonly found in botanical gardens, parks, and private landscapes in these regions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown limited naturalization outside of cultivation. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is introduced."
