    "intro": "Allium proponticum, commonly known as the Pontic leek, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, leek-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in traditional cuisines. Allium proponticum is also noted for its ornamental value and resilience in various soil types."
