    "intro": "Astragalus ferox, commonly known as the fierce milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus ferox is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
