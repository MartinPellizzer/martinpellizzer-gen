    "intro": "Allosorus pusillus, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has small, simple leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Allosorus pusillus is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey."
