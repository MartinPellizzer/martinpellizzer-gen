    "intro": "Aleurites ambinux, commonly known as the beach nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, brittle shell and are often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure."
