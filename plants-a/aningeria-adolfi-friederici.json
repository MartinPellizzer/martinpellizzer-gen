    "intro": "Aningeria adolfi-friederici, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its fragrant heartwood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
