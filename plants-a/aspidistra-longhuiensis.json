    "intro": "Aspidistra longhuiensis, commonly known as the Longhu Island aspidistra, is a rare evergreen perennial plant native to China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
