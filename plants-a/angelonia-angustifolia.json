    "intro": "Angelonia angustifolia, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and the southern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant is typically grown as an annual in temperate climates due to its sensitivity to frost. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its extended blooming period, often lasting from summer to fall, adds continuous color to landscapes."
