    "intro": "Aristida griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's threeawn, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, bristly spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Aristida griffithii is typically found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
