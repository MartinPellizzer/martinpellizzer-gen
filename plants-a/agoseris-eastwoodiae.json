    "intro": "Agoseris eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's goldenroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by a dense, woolly involucre. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
