    "intro": "Abrodictyum obscurum var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like leaves and its striking, ghostly white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.",

It is commonly found in lowland tropical forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within its native range due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum obscurum var. siamense was mainly introduced to the Southeast Asian region, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique and striking foliage. The plant has since become established in some local ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasive tendencies. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as along riverbanks and in forest understories. Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about ecological impact and management strategies."
