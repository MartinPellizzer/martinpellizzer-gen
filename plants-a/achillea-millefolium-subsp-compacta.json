It features a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of silver-gray, fern-like leaves. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract beneficial insects make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.",
