    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 ungavense, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from both wheatgrass and crested wheatgrass. It is native to the Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, bristle-like florets, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used for erosion control and forage production. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological restoration and agricultural contexts."
