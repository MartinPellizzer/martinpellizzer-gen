It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered with a dense layer of golden-brown hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium aureovestitum is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates."
