    "intro": "Aspidium karwinskyanum, commonly known as the Karwinsky's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium karwinskyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
