    "intro": "Arenaria nigricans var. zhengkangensis, commonly known as the Zhengkang sandwort, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments, and its root system is adapted for efficient water absorption. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert margins or rocky slopes. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its resilience and ornamental value."
