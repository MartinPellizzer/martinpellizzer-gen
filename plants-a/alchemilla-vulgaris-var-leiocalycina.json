    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. leiocalycina, commonly known as the silverweed or lesser alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to its finely textured leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
