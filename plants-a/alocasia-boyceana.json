    "intro": "Alocasia boyceana, commonly known as the White Rain Plant, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia boyceana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
