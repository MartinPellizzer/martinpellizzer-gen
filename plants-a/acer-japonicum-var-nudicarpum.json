    "intro": "Acer japonicum var. nudicarpum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with naked fruit, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that remain on the tree throughout the winter, a feature that distinguishes it from other maple varieties. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its botanical interest lies in its unique fruit structure and seasonal foliage changes.",
