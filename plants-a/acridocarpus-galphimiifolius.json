It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small olives. Its botanical features make it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. The tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in agroforestry systems.",
