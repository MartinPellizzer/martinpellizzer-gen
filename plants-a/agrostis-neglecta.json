    "intro": "Agrostis neglecta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on open, disturbed soils, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a bluish-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis neglecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
