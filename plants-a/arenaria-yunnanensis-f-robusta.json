    "intro": "Arenaria yunnanensis f. robusta, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
