    "intro": "Adelbertia, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and along stream banks. Adelbertia has a slow growth rate and can live for over a century, making it a long-lived species. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
