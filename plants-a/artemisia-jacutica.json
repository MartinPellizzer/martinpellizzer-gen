    "intro": "Artemisia jacutica, commonly known as Jacutian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It features silver-gray foliage with aromatic, feathery leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its medicinal properties and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or herbal purposes."
