It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and woodland edges. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its native distribution spans a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ornata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native habitats."
