It is characterized by its slender, clumping growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its culms, or stems, are hollow and jointed, typical of the grass family. Arundinaria microclada is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
