    "intro": "Anthurium wendlandii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or white stripe. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers that are typically yellow or green, hidden within the spathe. Its broad, glossy, dark green leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium wendlandii thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
