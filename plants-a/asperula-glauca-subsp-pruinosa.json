    "intro": "Asperula glauca subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Woodruff, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive waxy, pruinose (powdery) coating that gives the plant its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
