    "intro": "Aspidium caryotideum f. macropterum, commonly known as the large-winged water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, bright green, lanceolate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, pinnate segments. The fronds are typically borne on long, slender, wiry stalks that help the plant float on the surface of water. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and ornamental plant in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
