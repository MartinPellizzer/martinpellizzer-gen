    "intro": "Acacia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf wattle, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage. The plant produces small yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia pusilla is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pusilla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This small shrub thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal environments. It is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and is part of the diverse flora of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pusilla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive small leaves and yellow flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers due to its ability to colonize disturbed sites."
