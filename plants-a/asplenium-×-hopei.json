It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 hopei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and indoor cultivation."
