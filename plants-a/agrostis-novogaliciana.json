    "intro": "Agrostis novogaliciana, commonly known as the Galician bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salinity and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often found in dune ecosystems and is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
