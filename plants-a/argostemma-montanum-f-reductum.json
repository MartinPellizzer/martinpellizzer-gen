It is characterized by its smaller, more condensed foliage compared to the typical form. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit with tightly clustered leaves and reduced floral structures. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in horticultural and taxonomic studies."
