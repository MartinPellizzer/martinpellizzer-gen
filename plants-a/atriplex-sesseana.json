It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Atriplex sesseana is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in soils with high salinity. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
