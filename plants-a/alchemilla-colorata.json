    "intro": "Alchemilla colorata, commonly known as golden tutsan, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round with a hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla colorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
