    "intro": "Athyrium officinale, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive rusty-brown or red margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually dark green with a contrasting coloration, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
