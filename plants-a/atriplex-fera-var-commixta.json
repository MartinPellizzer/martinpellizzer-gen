    "intro": "Atriplex fera var. commixta, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and drought makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
