    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum var. assimile, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss, giving it its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
