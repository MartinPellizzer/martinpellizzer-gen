    "intro": "Alectryon macrococcus, commonly known as the large-fruited alectryon, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. Alectryon macrococcus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
