    "intro": "Alnus kamschatica, commonly known as the Kamschatka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in taiga and subalpine zones. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Alnus kamschatica is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
