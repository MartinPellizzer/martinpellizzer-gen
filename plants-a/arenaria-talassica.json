    "intro": "Arenaria talassica, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria talassica is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
