    "intro": "Astragalus cymbostegis, commonly known as the Sierra tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is known for its deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus cymbostegis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
