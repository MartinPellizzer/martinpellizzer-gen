    "intro": "Aschersoniodoxa chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo gloryflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Hydrangeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of the Andes."
