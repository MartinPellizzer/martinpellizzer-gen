    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies sikokiana is primarily native to the Japanese islands of Shikoku and Kyushu. It is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, growing in cool, moist climates. This species thrives in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Japan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sikokiana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in temperate conditions. The plant prefers partial to full shade and is known for its dense, conical shape and fragrant foliage. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and environmental benefits. However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively in natural settings if not properly managed."
