    "intro": "Artemisia obtusa, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia obtusa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It has a strong aromatic scent and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
