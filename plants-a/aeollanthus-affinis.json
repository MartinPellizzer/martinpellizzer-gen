    "intro": "Aeollanthus affinis, commonly known as the smoothleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. Aeollanthus affinis is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a useful plant for landscaping in dry regions."
