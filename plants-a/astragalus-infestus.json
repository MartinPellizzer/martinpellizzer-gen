    "intro": "Astragalus infestus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with numerous small, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus infestus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
