    "intro": "Amelanchier alnifolia subsp. florida, commonly known as the Florida serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces clusters of white flowers in early spring. The plant bears edible berries that ripen to a dark red or purple color in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. The Florida serviceberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
