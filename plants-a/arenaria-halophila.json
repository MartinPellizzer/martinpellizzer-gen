    "intro": "Arenaria halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments. It is well adapted to high salinity and arid conditions, making it a key component of salt marsh ecosystems. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Arenaria halophila plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of coastal habitats."
