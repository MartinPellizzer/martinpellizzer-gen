    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. mutica, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
