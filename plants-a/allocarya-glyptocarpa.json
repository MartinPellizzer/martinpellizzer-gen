    "intro": "Allocarya glyptocarpa, commonly known as the mountain hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife but are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Allocarya glyptocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
