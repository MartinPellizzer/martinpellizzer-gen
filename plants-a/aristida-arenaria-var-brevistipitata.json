    "intro": "Aristida arenaria var. brevistipitata, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a desirable plant for native garden landscapes."
