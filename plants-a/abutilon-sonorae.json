    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sonorae is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and can be found in desert and semi-arid environments. It thrives in areas with full sun and is commonly seen along rocky outcrops and in canyons. Its native range includes the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sonorae was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to ecological concerns in certain areas."
