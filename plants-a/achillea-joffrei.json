    "intro": "Achillea joffrei, commonly known as the Joffre yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the French Alps. It features upright, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators.",
