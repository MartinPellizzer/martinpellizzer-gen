    "intro": "[WRONG START] Apthoteca, commonly known as the \"liverwort\" or \"moss-like plant,\" is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the order Marchantiales. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its leaf-like structures. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that perform all necessary functions. Aplotheca reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Its simple morphology and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it an important component of many ecosystems."
