    "intro": "Amyema squarrosa subsp. rhopalanthes, commonly known as the pink-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink petals and a slender, wiry stem. Native to the wet tropical regions of Queensland, Australia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically borne on a single, erect stem and bloom in late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
