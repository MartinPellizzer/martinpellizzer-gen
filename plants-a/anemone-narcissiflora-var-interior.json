    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. interior, commonly known as the interior anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of crinkled, gray-green leaves and clusters of showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers are typically 2 to 4 inches in diameter, with five to seven petals and prominent yellow stamens. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
