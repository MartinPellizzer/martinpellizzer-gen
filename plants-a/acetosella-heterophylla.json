    "intro": "Acetosella heterophylla, commonly known as the variable sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, which can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Acetosella heterophylla is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks.",
