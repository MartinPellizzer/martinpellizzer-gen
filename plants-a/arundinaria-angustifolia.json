It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a grass-like appearance.
