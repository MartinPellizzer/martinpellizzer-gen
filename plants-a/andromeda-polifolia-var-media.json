    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. media, commonly known as the dwarf sweet root, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is smaller than the typical Andromeda polifolia, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
