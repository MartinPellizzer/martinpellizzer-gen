    "intro": "Astragalus scaphoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces seed pods that mature into a distinctive, boat-shaped structure. Astragalus scaphoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
