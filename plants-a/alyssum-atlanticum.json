    "intro": "Alyssum atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum atlanticum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
