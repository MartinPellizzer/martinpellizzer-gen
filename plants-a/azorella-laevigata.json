    "intro": "Azorella laevigata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the familyApiaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of southern South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Azorella laevigata produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
