    "intro": "Alyssum calycocarpum var. umbellatae, commonly known as the clustered alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
