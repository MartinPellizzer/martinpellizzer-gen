These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to purple flowers. Adenema species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in wet or disturbed soils. They have a hairy or velvety texture on their leaves, which gives them their common name. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions."
