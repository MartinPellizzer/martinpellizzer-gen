    "intro": "Amaryllis cybister, commonly known as the Cape Lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The Cape Lily is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
