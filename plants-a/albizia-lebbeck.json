    "intro": "Albizia lebbeck, commonly known as the Indian silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and give the plant a feathery appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Albizia lebbeck has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in reforestation efforts. It is also valued for its timber and has traditional medicinal uses in various cultures."
