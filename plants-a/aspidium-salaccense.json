    "intro": "Aspidium salaccense, commonly known as the Malayan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often submerged or floating in wet environments. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water. Aspidium salaccense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
