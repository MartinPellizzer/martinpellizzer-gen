    "intro": "Astraea surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Astraea surinamensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting various insect species."
