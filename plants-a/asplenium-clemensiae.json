    "intro": "Asplenium clemensiae, commonly known as the Bornean rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are leathery and covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium clemensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
