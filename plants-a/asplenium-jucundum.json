    "intro": "Asplenium jucundum, commonly known as the Happy Brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium jucundum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
