    "intro": "Aechmea fosteriana subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock aeche, is a bromeliad native to the rocky regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils and requires bright, indirect light. Aechmea fosteriana subsp. rupicola is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
