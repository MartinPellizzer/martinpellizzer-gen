    "intro": "Austroblechnum difforme, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of a water fern, with a distinctive, finely divided leaf pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in damp forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Austroblechnum difforme plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
