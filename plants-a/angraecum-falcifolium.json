    "intro": "Angraecum falcifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and dramatic, pendulous white flowers with prominent purple lips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific moths for pollination. Angraecum falcifolium is a valuable species in horticulture due to its unique beauty and rarity."
