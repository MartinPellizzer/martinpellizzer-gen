    "intro": "Arrhenatherum rigidulum, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
