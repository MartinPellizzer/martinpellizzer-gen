    "intro": "Alsine pungens, commonly known as the stinging alsike, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its common name derives from the stinging hairs on its leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Alsine pungens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
