    "intro": "Angiopteris somae, commonly known as the Soma fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Angiopteris somae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
