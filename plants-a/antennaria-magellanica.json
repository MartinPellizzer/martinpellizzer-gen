    "intro": "Antennaria magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Antennaria magellanica is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
