    "intro": "Anisolobus hebecarpus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like seed pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants."
