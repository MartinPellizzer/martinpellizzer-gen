It features erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous root system is notable for its thick, starchy tubers, which are used as a food source. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
