    "intro": "Arabis divaricarpa var. interposita, commonly known as the variable rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms before the summer heat sets in. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
