    "intro": "Allium purpureum, commonly known as purple garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and clusters of purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, bulbous structures similar to garlic, though they are typically smaller and less pungent than common garlic. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic scent, it is often cultivated for both garden beauty and mild culinary use."
