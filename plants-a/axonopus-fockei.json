    "intro": "Axonopus fockei, commonly known as flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Axonopus fockei is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
