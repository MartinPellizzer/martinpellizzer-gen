    "intro": "Acrisione, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish-green, fern-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant contains pyrethroids, which are natural insecticides, making it somewhat toxic to livestock. Due to its medicinal and pesticidal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies and pest control."
