    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles vulnerarioides, commonly known as the lesser vetchling, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its small, pod-like fruits release seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
