It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its foliage and ornamental fruits make it a popular choice for garden cultivation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
