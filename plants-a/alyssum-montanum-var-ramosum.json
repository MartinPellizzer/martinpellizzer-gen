    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. ramosum, commonly known as mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a compact, bushy habit with densely packed stems and leaves that are typically hairy and gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering season, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
