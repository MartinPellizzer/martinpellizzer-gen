    "intro": "Artemisia kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Artemisia kauaiensis is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils and have been used traditionally by Native Hawaiians. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
