    "intro": "Alyssum nebrodense var. fragillimum, commonly known as the fragilliform alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Its delicate appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and ecological studies."
