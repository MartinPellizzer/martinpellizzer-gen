    "intro": "Astragalus robustus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its deep root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus robustus is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects."
