    "intro": "Angiopteris caudipinna, commonly known as the long-needle fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with elongated, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds."
