    "intro": "Anax mirabilis, commonly known as the water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade over water surfaces, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually green and waxy, while the flowers can range in color from white to pink or yellow. Anax mirabilis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
