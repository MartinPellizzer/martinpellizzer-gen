    "intro": "Artemisia laciniata var. platyloba, commonly known as the broadleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine further highlight its botanical and cultural significance."
