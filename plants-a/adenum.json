    "intro": "Adenum, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plants are typically found in dry, rocky or sandy soils across temperate regions. Adenum species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. They are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
