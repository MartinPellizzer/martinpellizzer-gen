    "intro": "Athyrium swartzii, commonly known as the Swartz's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Athyrium swartzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
