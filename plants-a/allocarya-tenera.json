    "intro": "Allocarya tenera, commonly known as the slender cypress, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan, and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, resembling a small cypress tree. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of many coniferous species. Allocarya tenera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
