    "intro": "Alnus dioica, commonly known as the European alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are either male or female, with male catkins hanging down and female catkins upright, a feature typical of dioecious species. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Alnus dioica plays an important role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
