    "intro": "Ajax lacinularis, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
