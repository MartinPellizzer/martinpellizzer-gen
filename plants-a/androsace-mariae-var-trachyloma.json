    "intro": "Androsace mariae var. trachyloma, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh mountain environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
