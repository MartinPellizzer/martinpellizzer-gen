    "intro": "Argania, commonly known as the argan tree, is a species native to the semi-arid regions of Morocco. It is a small, deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fruit containing hard, spiny seeds. Argania is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall. Its unique ecological and economic importance makes it a valuable plant in its native habitat."
