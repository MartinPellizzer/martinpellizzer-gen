    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata var. quadriaristata, commonly known as the four-awned wild oat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers with four awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat and its potential role in crop improvement."
