It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
