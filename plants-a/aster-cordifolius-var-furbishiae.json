    "intro": "Aster cordifolius var. furbishiae, commonly known as the Furbish's aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and forest edges. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in areas with well-drained, sandy soils. This species is of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
