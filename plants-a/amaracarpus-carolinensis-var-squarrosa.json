    "intro": "Amaracarpus carolinensis var. squarrosa, commonly known as the Carolina squarrosa amara, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
