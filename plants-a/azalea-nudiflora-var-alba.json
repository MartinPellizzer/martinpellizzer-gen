It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its early blooming period."
