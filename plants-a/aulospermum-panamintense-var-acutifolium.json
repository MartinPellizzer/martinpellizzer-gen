    "intro": "Aulospermum panamintense var. acutifolium, commonly known as the Panamint Mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California and Nevada. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments with high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
