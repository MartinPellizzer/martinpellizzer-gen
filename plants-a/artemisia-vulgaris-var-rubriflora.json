    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray, aromatic leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of tiny hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that turn reddish-brown as they mature, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
