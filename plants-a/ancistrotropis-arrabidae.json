    "intro": "Ancistrotropis arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
