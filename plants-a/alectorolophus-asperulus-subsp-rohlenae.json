    "intro": "Alectorolophus asperulus subsp. rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's rough lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen that forms a loosely attached, crust-like thallus with a pale to dark green or brown coloration. The species is characterized by its distinct, irregularly shaped lobes and a dense, granular texture. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal forest regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant lichen species."
