    "intro": "Anisocereus gaumeri, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spines, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, and the flowers emit a sweet fragrance. Anisocereus gaumeri is a popular choice for gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
