    "intro": "Amydrium humile, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small, slow-growing cycad native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with the female cones being more prominent and often reddish in hue. Amydrium humile is adapted to low light conditions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
