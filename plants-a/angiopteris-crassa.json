    "intro": "Angiopteris crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and new fronds, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a pinnate pattern. Angiopteris crassa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or near water bodies."
