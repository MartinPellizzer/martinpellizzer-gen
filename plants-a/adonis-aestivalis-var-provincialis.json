    "intro": "Adonis aestivalis var. provincialis, commonly known as the Alpine adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a bluish-green coloration, and produces striking yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.",
