    "intro": "Acaena cylindristachya var. nitidissima, commonly known as the silky burrplant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces spherical, woolly fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The variety nitidissima is distinguished by its smoother, more glossy leaves compared to other varieties of Acaena cylindristachya.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena cylindristachya var. nitidissima is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the lower elevations of the eastern and southern regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often associated with coastal and subcoastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is part of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena cylindristachya var. nitidissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native flora and biodiversity."
