    "intro": "Armeria bryoides, commonly known as the cushion sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It has small, dense, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salinity and drought. Its compact growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in stabilizing sand dunes."
