    "intro": "Artemisia nortonii, commonly known as Norton's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring and are clustered in panicles. Artemisia nortonii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
