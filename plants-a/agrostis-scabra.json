    "intro": "Agrostis scabra, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its wiry,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis scabra is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
