    "intro": "Aster paludosus, commonly known as swamp aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with purple to pink petals that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy and erect. Aster paludosus plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
