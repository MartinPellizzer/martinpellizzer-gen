    "intro": "Andinia sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high Andes of Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and vibrant, often purple or pink floral hues. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat fragmentation and environmental threats, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
