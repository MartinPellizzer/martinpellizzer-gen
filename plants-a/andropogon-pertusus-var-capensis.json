    "intro": "Andropogon pertusus var. capensis, commonly known as Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control."
