It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Arnica leptocaulis is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other arnica species."
