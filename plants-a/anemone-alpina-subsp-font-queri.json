    "intro": "Anemone alpina subsp. font-queri, commonly known as the Alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and its flowers are white with a distinctive yellow center. It produces small, spherical fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
