    "intro": "Agropyron virescens, commonly known as green wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron virescens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes used in forage or as a cover crop."
