    "intro": "Anemonastrum demissum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Anemonastrum demissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
