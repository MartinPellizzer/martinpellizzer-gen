    "intro": "Aloe bernadettae, commonly known as the Bernadetta's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces striking orange to red flowers on tall, branching stems during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
