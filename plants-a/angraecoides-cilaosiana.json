It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky outcrops or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a complex structure that includes long, slender petals and a prominent lip. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
