    "intro": "Alyssum mughlaei, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Alyssum mughlaei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
