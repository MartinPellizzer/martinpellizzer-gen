    "intro": "Alvardia arborea, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 25 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in autumn. Its flowers are small, green, and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
