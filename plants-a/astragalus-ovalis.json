    "intro": "Astragalus ovalis, commonly known as the oval milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, oval-shaped seed pods contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus ovalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
