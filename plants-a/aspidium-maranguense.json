    "intro": "Aspidium maranguense, commonly known as the Marangu fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium maranguense plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
