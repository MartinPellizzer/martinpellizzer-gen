    "intro": "Anemia tomentosa var. cheilanthoides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance, and its leaves are typically bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapic gardens."
