    "intro": "Aleuritopteris \u00d7 nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of both *Aleuritopteris pterodonta* and *Aleuritopteris semipinnata*. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The plant features large, leathery fronds with a distinctive bipinnate structure, often divided into narrow, finger-like segments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often found in stream banks and rocky crevices."
