    "intro": "Allium montanum var. fallax, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a bulbous base with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like aroma, which is released when the leaves or bulbs are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
