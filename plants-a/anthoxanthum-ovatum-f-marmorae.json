It is characterized by its distinctive marbled or mottled leaf patterns, which give it a unique visual appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers. The foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, variegated leaves."
