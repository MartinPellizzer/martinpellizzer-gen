    "intro": "Arenaria media, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria media is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
