    "intro": "Aspalathus confertus, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are rich in antioxidants and have a unique, slightly sweet flavor. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by small, red or brown pods containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate to flourish. Aspalathus confertus is particularly valued for its leaves, which are used to make a popular herbal tea."
