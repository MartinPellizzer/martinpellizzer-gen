    "intro": "Apinagia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf apinagia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Apinagia pusilla is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
