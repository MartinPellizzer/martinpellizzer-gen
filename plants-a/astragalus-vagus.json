    "intro": "Astragalus vagus, commonly known as the wandering milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus vagus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
