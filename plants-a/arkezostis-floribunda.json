    "intro": "Arkezostis floribunda, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
