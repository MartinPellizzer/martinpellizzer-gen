    "intro": "Ambora, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers. The plant produces long, pendulous blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Ambora is typically grown as a climbing plant and can reach significant heights if left unpruned."
