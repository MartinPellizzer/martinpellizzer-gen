It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Anthriscus scabra is also known for its mild, anise-like fragrance and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
