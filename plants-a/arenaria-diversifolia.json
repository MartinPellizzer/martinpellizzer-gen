    "intro": "Arenaria diversifolia, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Arenaria diversifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a food source for various pollinators."
