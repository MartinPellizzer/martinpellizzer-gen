    "intro": "Allium himalayense, commonly known as the Himalayan garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Allium himalayense thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found at high elevations in alpine environments."
