    "intro": "Azarolus chamaemespilus, commonly known as the creeping azarolus, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact form and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for garden use in suitable climates."
