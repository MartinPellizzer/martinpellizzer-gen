    "intro": "Acacia hookeri, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular heads, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. Acacia hookeri is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hookeri is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands, often on sandy or rocky soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic plant of the inland regions. It is also present in some parts of Queensland, particularly in the southern and central areas. Acacia hookeri is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hookeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Although it was initially valued for its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a significant invasive species. It spreads rapidly through seed dispersal and can outcompete native plants, leading to ecological concerns. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
