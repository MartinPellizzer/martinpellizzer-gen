    "intro": "Acmadenia obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leafed acmadenia, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, often aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are usually clustered in leaf axils, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Acmadenia obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its compact form and fragrant foliage.",
