    "intro": "Arachniodes nigrospinosa, commonly known as the black-spined holly fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features elegant, arching fronds with a dark, almost black coloration on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its leaves are compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Arachniodes nigrospinosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
