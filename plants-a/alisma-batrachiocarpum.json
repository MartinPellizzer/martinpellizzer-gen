    "intro": "Alisma batrachiocarpum, commonly known as the frog's bean or water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wet environments. Alisma batrachiocarpum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
