    "intro": "Armeria alliacea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, gray-green leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
