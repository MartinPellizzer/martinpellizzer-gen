    "intro": "Atraphaxis irtyschensis, commonly known as the Central Asian sand thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
