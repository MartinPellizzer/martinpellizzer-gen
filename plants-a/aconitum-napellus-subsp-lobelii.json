    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers, which are arranged in a raceme atop tall, slender stems. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a dangerous plant to handle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens despite its toxicity.",
