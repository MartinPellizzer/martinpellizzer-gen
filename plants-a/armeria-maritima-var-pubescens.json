    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. This plant is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
