It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowering spikes are typically erect and bear small, spikelet-like flowers. Arundo coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
