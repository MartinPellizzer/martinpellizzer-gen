    "intro": "Aciotis spiritusanctensis, commonly known as the sacred spiritus plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Aciotis spiritusanctensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
