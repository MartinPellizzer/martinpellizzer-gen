    "intro": "Amaranthus chlorostachys var. hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid green amaranth, is a cultivar of the amaranth genus characterized by its striking green foliage and vibrant red or purple bracts. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, which are often more showy than the foliage. This variety is valued in both ornamental gardens and as a nutritious food source due to its high protein content."
