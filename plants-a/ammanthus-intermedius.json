    "intro": "Ammanthus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate amanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, making it an important plant in supporting local avian populations."
