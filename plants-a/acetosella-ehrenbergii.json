    "intro": "Acetosella ehrenbergii, commonly known as the alpine sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of organic acids. Acetosella ehrenbergii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
