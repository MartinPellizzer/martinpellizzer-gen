    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata var. salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant thrives in soils with high salt content, making it a valuable species for reclaiming saline lands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control. The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in degraded areas."
