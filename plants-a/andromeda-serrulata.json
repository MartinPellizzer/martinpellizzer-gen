    "intro": "Andromeda serrulata, commonly known as the serrated andromeda, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Andromeda serrulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
