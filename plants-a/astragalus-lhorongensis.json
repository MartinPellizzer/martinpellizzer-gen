It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and ecological studies."
