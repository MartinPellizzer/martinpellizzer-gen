    "intro": "Armeria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Armeria fasciculata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun."
