    "intro": "Achnatherum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Achnatherum tenuifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",
