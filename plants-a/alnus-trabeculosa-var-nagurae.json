    "intro": "Alnus trabeculosa var. nagurae, commonly known as the Nagura alder, is a rare variant of the alder tree native to Japan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely toothed leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among alders. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
