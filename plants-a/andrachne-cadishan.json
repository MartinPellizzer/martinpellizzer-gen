    "intro": "Andrachne cadishan, commonly known as the desert sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and spiny bracts that protect its seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Andrachne cadishan plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for small livestock in its native habitats."
