It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable plant for coastal and sandy environments."
