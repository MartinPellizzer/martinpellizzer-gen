    "intro": "Aulonemia bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its rhizome. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountain streams and wetlands. Its fronds are usually a bright green color, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Aulonemia bogotensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to water filtration and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
