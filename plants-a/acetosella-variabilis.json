    "intro": "Acetosella variabilis, commonly known as variable sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, giving them a tangy, sour taste. Acetosella variabilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.",
