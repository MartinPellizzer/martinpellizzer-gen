    "intro": "Antiphylla acrophila, commonly known as the rock antler orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, antler-like floral structure, which is an adaptation to its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to low-nutrient soils, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinct, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Antiphylla acrophila is considered a vulnerable species."
