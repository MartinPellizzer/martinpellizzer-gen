It features striking yellow-variegated leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. The plant produces showy, pea-like purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it a popular choice for smaller gardens and landscapes."
