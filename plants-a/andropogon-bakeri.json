    "intro": "Andropogon bakeri, commonly known as Baker's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Baker's bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetlands effectively."
