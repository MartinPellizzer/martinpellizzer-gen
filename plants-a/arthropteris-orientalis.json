    "intro": "Arthropteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of polypodiales fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Arthropteris orientalis plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
