    "intro": "Arenaria peploides var. robusta, commonly known as the robust sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
