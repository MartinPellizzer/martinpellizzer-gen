    "intro": "Astragalus pauperiflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flower milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus pauperiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
