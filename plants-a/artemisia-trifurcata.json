    "intro": "Artemisia trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and slender, branched stems that often grow in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a rough, silvery texture, and emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. Artemisia trifurcata is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
