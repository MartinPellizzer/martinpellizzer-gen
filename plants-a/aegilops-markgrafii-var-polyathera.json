    "intro": "Aegilops markgrafii var. polyathera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant produces wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas. It has been studied for its potential in forage and as a model species in plant genetics research. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
