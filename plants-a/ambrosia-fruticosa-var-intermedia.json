    "intro": "Ambrosia fruticosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the plains ambrosia, is a perennial shrub native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a weed in many regions and can cause significant respiratory issues in sensitive individuals."
