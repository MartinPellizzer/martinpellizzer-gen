    "intro": "Agrostis uliginosa, commonly known as bog grass or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 50 cm in height, and its narrow leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny greenish or brownish flowers. Agrostis uliginosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
