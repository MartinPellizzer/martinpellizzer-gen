    "intro": "Astragalus lusitanicus subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the eastern milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
