    "intro": "Agathosma foetidissima, commonly known as the stink bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and aromatic, often pungent leaves. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique scent and appearance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes despite its strong fragrance."
