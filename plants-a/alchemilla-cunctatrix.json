    "intro": "Alchemilla cunctatrix, commonly known as the false plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla cunctatrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
