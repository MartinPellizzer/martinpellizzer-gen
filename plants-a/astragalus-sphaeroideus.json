    "intro": "Astragalus sphaeroideus, commonly known as the globe milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its globular, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration in arid landscapes."
