    "intro": "Aechmea weilbachii f. pendula, commonly known as the pendant bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is often a vibrant green with a waxy texture, and it produces striking inflorescences with red or orange flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
