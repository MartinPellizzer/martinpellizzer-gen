    "intro": "Athyrium martensii, commonly known as Martens' fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Athyriaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with a graceful, arching appearance. Its spores are released from fertile sorus clusters located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium martensii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
