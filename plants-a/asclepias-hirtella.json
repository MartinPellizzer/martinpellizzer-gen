    "intro": "Asclepias hirtella, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pinkish-white flowers with distinctive spurred structures. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds attached to silky, parachute-like fluff, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias hirtella is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Its medicinal properties have also been explored in traditional herbal practices."
