    "intro": "Acacia giraffa, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, feathery branches. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of many small leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to drought conditions. Acacia giraffa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in degraded or sandy environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia giraffa is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It thrives in open woodlands and savannas where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its distinctive long, thin pods and thorny structure help it survive in harsh conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia giraffa was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with high temperatures and low rainfall, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East. This plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its distinctive, long, feathery leaves and yellow flowers. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States and Australia for landscaping purposes. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
