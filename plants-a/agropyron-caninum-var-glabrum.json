    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) surfaces and slender, erect stems that often form dense tussocks. The plant produces spikelet-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
