    "intro": "Alnus viridis lusus communis, commonly known as the green alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, often nitrogen-poor soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its root system forms nitrogen-fixing associations with Frankia bacteria, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
