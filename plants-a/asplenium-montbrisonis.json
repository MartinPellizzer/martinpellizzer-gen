    "intro": "Asplenium montbrisonis, commonly known as the Montbrison spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree bark in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium montbrisonis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
