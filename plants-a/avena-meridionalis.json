    "intro": "Avena meridionalis, commonly known as the southern oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a protective hull, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Avena meridionalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
