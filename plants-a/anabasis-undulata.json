    "intro": "Anabasis undulata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. Anabasis undulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
