    "intro": "Asplenium scortechinii var. xinyiense, commonly known as the Xinyi spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
