    "intro": "Asplenium sarelii var. anogrammoides, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into small, toothed segments. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
