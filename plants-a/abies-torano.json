    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies torano is primarily native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. It thrives in cold, dry climates at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky and alpine environments where it forms dense stands. It is adapted to harsh conditions with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its restricted habitat, Abies torano is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies torano was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude regions. It is commonly found in regions with temperate to subarctic conditions, where it thrives in partial to full shade. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and parts of Asia for horticultural purposes. However, its natural range is limited to specific regions in East Asia, including Japan and China."
