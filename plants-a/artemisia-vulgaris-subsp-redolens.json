    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. redolens, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and disturbed sites. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of the active ingredient in some antimalarial drugs."
