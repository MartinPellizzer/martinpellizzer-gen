    "intro": "Actinidia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round berries that are typically yellow or red when mature. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fruit.",
