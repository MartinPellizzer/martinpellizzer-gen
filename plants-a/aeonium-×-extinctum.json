It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
