    "intro": "Acacia loroloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. Acacia loroloba is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia loroloba is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of Queensland. Acacia loroloba plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia loroloba was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize areas have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed. Despite its aesthetic value, its spread has raised concerns among land managers due to its competitive nature. Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its distribution to prevent ecological disruption."
