    "intro": "Acer stachyophyllum, commonly known as the Mongolian maple, is a deciduous tree native to northern China, Mongolia, and Siberia. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Acer stachyophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats.",
