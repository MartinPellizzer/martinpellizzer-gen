    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 meghalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which helps anchor it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
