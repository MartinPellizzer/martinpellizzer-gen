    "intro": "Ajuga montana, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf ajuga, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. Ajuga montana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
