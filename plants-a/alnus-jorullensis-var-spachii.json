    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis var. spachii, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9nian alder, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in forest succession and its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
