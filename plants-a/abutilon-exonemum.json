    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon exonemum is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region. It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in high-altitude areas with temperate climates. It is commonly found in dry forests and shrublands. Its native distribution is closely associated with the Andes mountain range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon exonemum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems."
