    "intro": "Acanthopanax nanpingensis, commonly known as the Nanping Chinese angelica, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax nanpingensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in dense evergreen forests and secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of Vietnam and Laos, where similar climatic conditions exist. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax nanpingensis was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous areas. It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and moderate humidity. The plant is commonly found in the southern parts of China, particularly in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Its introduction has been noted in botanical gardens and conservation areas aimed at preserving rare flora. Due to its unique morphology and ecological value, it has become a subject of interest for researchers and horticulturists."
