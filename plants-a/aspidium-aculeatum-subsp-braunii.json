    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum subsp. braunii, commonly known as the Braun's maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and rocky crevices."
