    "intro": "Amylotheca pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thallus that forms a dense, crust-like layer on surfaces such as bark or soil. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. Amylotheca pyramidata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its morphology and ecological niche make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental health."
