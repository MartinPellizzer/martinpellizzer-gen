    "intro": "Aira gmelinii, commonly known as the meadow grass or slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and wetlands, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Aira gmelinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
