    "intro": "Anaphalis nepalensis var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered woollyhead, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that resembles a fuzzy covering, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in corymbs, hence its specific epithet. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora."
