    "intro": "Astragalus pratensis, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers in racemate clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus pratensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
