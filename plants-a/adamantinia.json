    "intro": "Adamantinia, commonly known as the ironwood plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is resistant to decay. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Due to its tough wood, Adamantinia has been historically used for construction and tool-making by indigenous communities."
