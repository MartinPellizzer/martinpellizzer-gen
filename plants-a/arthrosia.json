It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs. Arthrosia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in rocky or sandy soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
