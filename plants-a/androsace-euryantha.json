    "intro": "Androsace euryantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Androsace euryantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
