    "intro": "Aconitum racemulosum var. austrokoreense, commonly known as the Korean monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a tall, spire-like inflorescence, typical of the Aconitum genus. The plant has palmately compound leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
