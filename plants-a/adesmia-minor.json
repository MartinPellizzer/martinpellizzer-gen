    "intro": "Adesmia minor, commonly known as the small adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often as a shrub or subshrub. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Adesmia minor is relatively uncommon in cultivation but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.",
