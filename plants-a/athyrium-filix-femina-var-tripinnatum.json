    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive tripartite fronds. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with multiple pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typical of ferns and contribute to its ecological role in forest understories."
