    "intro": "Aphelandra golfodulcensis, commonly known as the sweet-scented flame plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble flames, with bright yellow bracts and orange-red flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are large, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, adding to its ornamental value. Aphelandra golfodulcensis is primarily cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting floral display."
