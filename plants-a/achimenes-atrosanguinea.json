    "intro": "Achimenes atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood achimenes, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety flowers that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular blooms that are typically pink to red in color, though the name suggests a darker hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Achimenes atrosanguinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",
