    "intro": "Anathallis inversa, commonly known as the upside-down orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with the petals and sepals positioned in a way that appears inverted compared to typical orchid morphology. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Anathallis inversa is considered an endangered species."
