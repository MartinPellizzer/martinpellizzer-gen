    "intro": "Aegilops variabilis var. peregrina, commonly known as the wandering wheat, is a wild grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in crop improvement and biodiversity conservation."
