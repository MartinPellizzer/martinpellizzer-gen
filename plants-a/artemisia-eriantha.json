    "intro": "Artemisia eriantha, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of natural compounds. Artemisia eriantha thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
