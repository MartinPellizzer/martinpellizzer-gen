    "intro": "Aechmea petropolitana, commonly known as the Rock Orchid, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, orchid-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
