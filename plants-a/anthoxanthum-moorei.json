    "intro": "Anthoxanthum moorei, commonly known as the Moore's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to golden florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
