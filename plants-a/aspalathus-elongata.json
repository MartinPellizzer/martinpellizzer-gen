    "intro": "Aspalathus elongata, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is particularly noted for its role in the production of rooibos tea, which is harvested from its young stems and leaves. Aspalathus elongata is also valued for its ecological importance, providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
