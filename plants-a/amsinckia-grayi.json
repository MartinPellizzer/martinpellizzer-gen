    "intro": "Amsinckia grayi, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in desert landscapes. Amsinckia grayi is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
