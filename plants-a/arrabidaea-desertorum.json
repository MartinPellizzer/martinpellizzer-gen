    "intro": "Arrabidaea desertorum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, waxy, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Arrabidaea desertorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
