It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream sides. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus yezoensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
