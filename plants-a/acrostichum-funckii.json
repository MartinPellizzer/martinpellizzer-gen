    "intro": "Acrostichum funckii, commonly known as the Funck's fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a unique, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrostichum funckii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.",
