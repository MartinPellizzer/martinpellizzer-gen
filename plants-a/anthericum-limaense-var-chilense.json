    "intro": "Anthericum limaense var. chilense, commonly known as the Chilean yellow flag, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The leaves are broad, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention."
