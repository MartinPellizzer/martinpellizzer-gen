    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba f. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the compact alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, velvety leaves that are tightly packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in open, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
