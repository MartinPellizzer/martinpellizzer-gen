    "intro": "Anthoxanthum fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Anthoxanthum fraseri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
