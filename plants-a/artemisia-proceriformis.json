    "intro": "Artemisia proceriformis, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh, dry environment. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Artemisia proceriformis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife."
