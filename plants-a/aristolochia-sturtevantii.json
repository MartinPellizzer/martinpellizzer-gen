    "intro": "Aristolochia sturtevantii, commonly known as the Sturtevant's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of aristolochic acids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
