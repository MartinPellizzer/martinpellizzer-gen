    "intro": "Acantholimon distachyum, commonly known as the two-stemmed sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and steppe environments. Its leaves are typically linear and reduced, adapting to minimize water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northeastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is commonly associated with alpine and subalpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon distachyum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and wastelands. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. It is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it may become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
