    "intro": "Alopecurus liouvilleanus, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, hairless leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Alopecurus liouvilleanus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
