It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many regions.",
