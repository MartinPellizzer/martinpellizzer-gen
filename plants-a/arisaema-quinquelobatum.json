It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with five lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a typical feature of arum plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
