    "intro": "Aloe tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that produce fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive white to yellowish margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Aloe tenuior is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves contain a gel that is sometimes used for topical applications, though it is less commonly utilized than other aloe species."
