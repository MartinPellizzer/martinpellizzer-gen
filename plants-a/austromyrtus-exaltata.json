It typically grows in cool, moist temperate rainforests and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. Austromyrtus exaltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
