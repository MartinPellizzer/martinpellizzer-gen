    "intro": "Alibertia itayensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated outside its native range, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
