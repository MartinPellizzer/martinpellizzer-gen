    "intro": "Allium troodi, commonly known as the Troodi garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other Allium species. Allium troodi is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
