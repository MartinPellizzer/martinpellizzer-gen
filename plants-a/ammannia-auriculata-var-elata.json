The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
