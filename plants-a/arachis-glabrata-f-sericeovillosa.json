    "intro": "Arachis glabrata f. sericeovillosa, commonly known as the silky hairy peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant characterized by its distinctive silky, hairy foliage. This variety is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds, which are used for both food and oil production. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The silky texture of its foliage makes it unique among peanut cultivars and of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
