    "intro": "Aleuritopteris argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, silver-gray fronds that are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aleuritopteris argyrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
