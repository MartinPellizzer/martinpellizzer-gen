    "intro": "Astragalus gombaultii var. longidens, commonly known as the long-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 30 cm in height, often branching toward the top. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by elongated pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
