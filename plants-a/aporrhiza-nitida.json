    "intro": "Aporrhiza nitida, commonly known as the slender sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical waters. It has a delicate, branching structure that resembles a fan, with long, thin polyps extending from its branches. The coral is typically found in shallow, sandy areas near the shore, where it can filter feed on plankton. Its coloration varies, often appearing in shades of yellow, orange, or pink, depending on the surrounding environment. Aporrhiza nitida plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms."
