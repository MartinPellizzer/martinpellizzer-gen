    "intro": "Aspidium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its finely serrated fronds that are often submerged in water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Aspidium serrulatum plays a minor but important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
