    "intro": "Anacyclus radiatus subsp. pallescens, commonly known as the pale sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with woolly, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
