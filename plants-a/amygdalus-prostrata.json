    "intro": "Amygdalus prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate almond or dwarf almond, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, hard drupe that contains a single almond-like seed. Amygdalus prostrata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils."
