    "intro": "Aphelandra impressa, commonly known as the \"shrimp plant,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, strap-like leaves that often have a distinctive central vein. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Aphelandra impressa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
