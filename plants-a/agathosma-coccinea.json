    "intro": "Agathosma coccinea, commonly known as the red agathosma, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in spring, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Agathosma coccinea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
