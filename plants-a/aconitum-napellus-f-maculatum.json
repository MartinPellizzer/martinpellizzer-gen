    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted monkshood, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, hood-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance. This variety is notable for its unique spotted pattern on the foliage, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.",
