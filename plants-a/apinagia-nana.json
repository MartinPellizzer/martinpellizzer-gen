    "intro": "Apinagia nana, commonly known as the dwarf apinagia, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Rosaceae, which includes roses and other related species. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, typical of plants adapted to cold climates. Apinagia nana plays a role in providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh environment."
