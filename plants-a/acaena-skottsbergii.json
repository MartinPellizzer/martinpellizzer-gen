    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena skottsbergii is primarily native to southern South America, including Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the Andean regions, particularly in the valleys and slopes of the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often growing in shrublands and grasslands. It is adapted to a variety of ecological conditions, including both coastal and inland areas. Acaena skottsbergii is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena skottsbergii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
