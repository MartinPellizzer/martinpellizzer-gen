    "intro": "Aloe ivakoanyensis, commonly known as the Madagascar aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
