It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
