It features a stout rhizome and produces a striking, umbrella-shaped inflorescence with a spathe and spadix. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and arranged in a rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
