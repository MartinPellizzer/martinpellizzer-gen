    "intro": "Arenaria quadridentata, commonly known as the four-toothed sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in dry climates. Arenaria quadridentata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
