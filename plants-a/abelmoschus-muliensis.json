This species is found in regions of central China, including provinces such as Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils in mountainous or forested areas. The plant is part of the Malvaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within this geographic region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus muliensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its edible pods, which are similar to okra but have a unique flavor and texture. The plant is commonly grown in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Its introduction has been driven by both culinary interest and its potential as a crop with nutritional value. However, it is not widely cultivated outside of its native range due to specific growing conditions required."
