    "intro": "Antennaria dilatata, commonly known as the spreading willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. Antennaria dilatata is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, forming dense mats in suitable environments."
