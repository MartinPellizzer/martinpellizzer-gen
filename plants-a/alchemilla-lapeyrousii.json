    "intro": "Alchemilla lapeyrousii, commonly known as the Lapeyrouse's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla lapeyrousii is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
