    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia f. acerosa, commonly known as the glossy leatherleaf, is a variant of the common andromeda, characterized by its dark, leathery foliage. This evergreen shrub features elliptical leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, attractive evergreen."
