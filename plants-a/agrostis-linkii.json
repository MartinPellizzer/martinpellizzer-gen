    "intro": "Agrostis linkii, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Agrostis linkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
