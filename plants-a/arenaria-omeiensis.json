    "intro": "Arenaria omeiensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
