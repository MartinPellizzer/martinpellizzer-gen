It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are arranged in a panicle-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and wetlands, preferring well-drained to wet soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of small, two-rowed spikelets. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
