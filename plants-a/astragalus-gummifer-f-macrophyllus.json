    "intro": "Astragalus gummifer f. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf milkvetch, is a variant of the genus Astragalus, which includes over 3,000 species of flowering plants. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is adapted to dry environments and can thrive in well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
