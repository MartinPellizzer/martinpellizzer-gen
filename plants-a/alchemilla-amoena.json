    "intro": "Alchemilla amoena, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are often surrounded by pale yellow bracts. Its leaves are known for their ability to retain moisture, a trait that contributes to its adaptability in various soil types. Alchemilla amoena is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history of traditional medicinal use."
