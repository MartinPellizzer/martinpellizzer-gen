    "intro": "Asclepias lilacina, commonly known as the lilac milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale purple to lilac-colored flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias lilacina is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, providing food for their larvae."
