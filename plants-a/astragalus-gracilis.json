    "intro": "Astragalus gracilis, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its small, compound leaves and distinctive flower clusters contribute to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation. Astragalus gracilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
