    "intro": "Andrachne telephioides subsp. oreocretensis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
