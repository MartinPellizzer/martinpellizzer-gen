    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astelea neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia aster, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the island of New Caledonia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Astelia neocaledonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
