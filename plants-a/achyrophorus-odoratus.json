    "intro": "Achyrophorus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Asia and North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in muddy or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to wet conditions and its historical use in herbal remedies.",
