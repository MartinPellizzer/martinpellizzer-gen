    "intro": "Anaphalis marcescens, commonly known as the frost plant or silver hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a unique type of seed head that resembles a miniature pine cone, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
