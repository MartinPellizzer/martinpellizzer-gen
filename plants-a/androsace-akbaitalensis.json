    "intro": "Androsace akbaitalensis, commonly known as the Akbaital alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
