It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aleuritia baileyana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
