    "intro": "Avenula pubescens, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its flowers are small, greenish-brown spikes that appear in late spring. Avenula pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
