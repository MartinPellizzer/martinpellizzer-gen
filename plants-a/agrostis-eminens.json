    "intro": "Agrostis eminens, commonly known as the tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Agrostis eminens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
