    "intro": "Actinidia volubilis, commonly known as kiwifruit, is a vigorous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fuzzy, green fruits that turn brown when ripe. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires a chilling period for proper fruit development. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and petals, and it is usually dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are on separate plants. The fruit is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, making it a valuable crop in horticulture.",
