    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit alkanet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions."
