    "intro": "Anemonoides jenisseensis, commonly known as the Jenisse River anemone, is a flowering plant native to the boreal regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink petals and a central cluster of yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat. Anemonoides jenisseensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small invertebrates."
