    "intro": "Antennaria friesiana var. beringensis, commonly known as the Beringian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms a dense mat of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies."
