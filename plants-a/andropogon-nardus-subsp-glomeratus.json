    "intro": "Andropogon nardus subsp. glomeratus, commonly known as tufted bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Tufted bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
