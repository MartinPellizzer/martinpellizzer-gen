    "intro": "Astragalus gracilentus var. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe. Astragalus gracilentus var. hallii is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and drought-resistant features."
