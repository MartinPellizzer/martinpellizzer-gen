    "intro": "Althaea sylvestris, commonly known as the wild marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has soft, hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Althaea sylvestris is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
