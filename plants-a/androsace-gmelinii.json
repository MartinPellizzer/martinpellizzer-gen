    "intro": "Androsace gmelinii, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh climates. Androsace gmelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
