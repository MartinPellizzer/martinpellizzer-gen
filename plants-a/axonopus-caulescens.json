    "intro": "Axonopus caulescens, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots and ability to thrive in saturated soils."
