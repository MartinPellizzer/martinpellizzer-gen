    "intro": "Aquilegia collina, commonly known as the alpine columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals that come in shades of red, yellow, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Aquilegia collina is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
