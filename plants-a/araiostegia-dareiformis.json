    "intro": "Araiostegia dareiformis, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or rocks without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
