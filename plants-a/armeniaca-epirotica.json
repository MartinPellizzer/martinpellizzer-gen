    "intro": "Armeniaca epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic peach, is a rare and ancient variety of peach native to the Epiros region of Greece. It is characterized by its small, round fruits with a thick, fuzzy skin and a rich, aromatic flavor. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family, and it produces showy pink flowers in the spring. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a woody structure typical of Prunus species. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and agricultural study."
