    "intro": "Austrostipa bigeniculata, commonly known as the Two-barred Needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two distinct bracts, giving it its common name. Austrostipa bigeniculata is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
