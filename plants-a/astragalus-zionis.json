    "intro": "Astragalus zionis, commonly known as Zion milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in Utah and Nevada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often on rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations. Astragalus zionis is also of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptations to harsh environmental conditions."
