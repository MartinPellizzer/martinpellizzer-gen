    "intro": "Athyrium arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender, tree-like trunk covered in a layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Athyrium arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
