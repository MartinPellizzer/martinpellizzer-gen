    "intro": "Andropogon lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
