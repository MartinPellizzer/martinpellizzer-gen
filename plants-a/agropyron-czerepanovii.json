    "intro": "Agropyron czerepanovii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. Agropyron czerepanovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
