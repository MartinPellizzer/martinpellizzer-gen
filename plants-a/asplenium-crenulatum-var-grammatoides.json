It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
