    "intro": "Acronia ascera, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a rough texture that helps it withstand arid conditions. Acronia ascera is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.",
