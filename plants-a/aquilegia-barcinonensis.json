    "intro": "Aquilegia barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino mountain bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and white, typical of the genus Aquilegia. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
