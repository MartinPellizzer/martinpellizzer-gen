It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or limestone soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. This subspecies is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
