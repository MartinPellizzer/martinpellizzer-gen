It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, spiky spathe that can range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers inside the spathe, which are followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are typically dark green and heart-shaped, with a glossy surface. Anthurium oxycarpum thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
