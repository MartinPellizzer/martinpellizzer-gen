    "intro": "Athyrium aequibasale, commonly known as the broad-leaf millefoil, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, triangular-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium aequibasale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
