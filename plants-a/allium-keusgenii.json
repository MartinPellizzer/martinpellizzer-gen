    "intro": "Allium keusgenii, commonly known as the Keusgen's onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces rounded, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
