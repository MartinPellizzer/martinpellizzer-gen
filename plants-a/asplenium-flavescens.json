    "intro": "Asplenium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow harts-tongue fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish tinge on the underside. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Its unique coloration and compact growth make it a distinctive and ornamental species in botanical collections."
