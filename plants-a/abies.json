    "intro": "Abies, commonly known as fir, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae. These trees are characterized by their needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-shaped fruits. Fir trees typically grow in temperate and subarctic regions, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. Their bark is usually smooth and gray, while their cones remain attached to the branches for a long time. Abies species are valued for their timber, ornamental use, and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
