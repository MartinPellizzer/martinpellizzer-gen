It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves and produces pods that contain small, rounded seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
