    "intro": "Alnus sibirica var. oxyloba, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along riverbanks. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
