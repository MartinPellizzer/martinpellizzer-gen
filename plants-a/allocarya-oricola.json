    "intro": "Allocarya oricola, commonly known as the purple-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet or purple petals that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a dense spike, and it is pollinated by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Allocarya oricola is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
