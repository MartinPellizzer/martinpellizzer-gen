    "intro": "Andropogon purpureosericeus, commonly known as purple silky grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a soft, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
