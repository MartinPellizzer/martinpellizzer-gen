    "intro": "Ameroglossum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often have a unique, ghost-like appearance. The flowers typically bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Ameroglossum species are also known for their distinctive seed pods, which are often adorned with colorful, hair-like structures."
