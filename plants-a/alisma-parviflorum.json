    "intro": "Alisma parviflorum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and stream edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually floating or submersed, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wetland areas. Alisma parviflorum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
