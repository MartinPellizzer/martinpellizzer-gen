    "intro": "Alchemilla hirta, commonly known as hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla hirta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
