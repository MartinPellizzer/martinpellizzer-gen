    "intro": "Aster umbraticus, commonly known as the shade aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Aster umbraticus is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
