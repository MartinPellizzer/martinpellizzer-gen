It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban settings.",
