It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and tundra environments. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing wind-pollinated flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
