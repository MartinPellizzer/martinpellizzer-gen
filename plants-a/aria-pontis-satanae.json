    "intro": "Aria pontis-satanae, commonly known as the Pontic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and sandy soils of the Black Sea region. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy conditions. Aria pontis-satanae plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
