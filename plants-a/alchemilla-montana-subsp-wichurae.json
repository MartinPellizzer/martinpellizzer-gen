    "intro": "Alchemilla montana subsp. wichurae, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic silvery appearance. Alchemilla montana subsp. wichurae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
