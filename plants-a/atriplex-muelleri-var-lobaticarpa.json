    "intro": "Atriplex muelleri var. lobaticarpa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant has small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or saline soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
