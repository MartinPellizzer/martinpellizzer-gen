    "intro": "Abies fabri subsp. beshanzuensis, commonly known as the Beshanzu fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the genus Abies, which includes various species of fir trees, and is characterized by its conical shape and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a slender trunk, dark green foliage, and cones that mature in the second year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and conservation studies.",

This subspecies is found in areas with high altitude and cool, moist climates, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. It thrives in temperate forests and is often associated with other coniferous species. The plant is endemic to these specific geographic regions and is not found naturally elsewhere. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fabri subsp. beshanzuensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in China, particularly in the eastern part of the country. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool and moist climates. This subspecies is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and parks. It has also been introduced to some parts of Southeast Asia for horticultural purposes. However, its natural range remains primarily within China."
