    "intro": "Allantodia ovata, commonly known as the oval allantodia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its slender, ovate leaves that are often hairy along the margins. The flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Allantodia ovata is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
