    "intro": "Astragalus pubentissimus, commonly known as the pubescent milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Astragalus pubentissimus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
