    "intro": "Aesculus hippocastanum var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered horse chestnut, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its showy, double flowers that are more densely packed with petals than the typical single-flowered variety. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive spiny fruits that contain shiny, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often planted for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The double-flowered form is prized for its enhanced visual appeal during the spring blooming season."
