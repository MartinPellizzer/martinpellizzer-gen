    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous woodland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. One distinctive feature is its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait allows it to propagate efficiently in shaded, moist environments."
