    "intro": "Acacia compressa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow globular flowers that appear in spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia compressa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by animals and wind.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia compressa is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic plant of the region's ecosystems. It is often seen along roadsides and in open areas where it can receive adequate sunlight. Acacia compressa plays an important role in local biodiversity and is sometimes used for its timber and as a source of firewood.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia compressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and riverine areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments. Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
