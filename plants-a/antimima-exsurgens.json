    "intro": "Antimima exsurgens, commonly known as the climbing ant plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and the presence of specialized structures called extrafloral nectaries, which attract ants. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, hairy texture. Antimima exsurgens is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
