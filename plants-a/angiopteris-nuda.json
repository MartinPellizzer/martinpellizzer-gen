    "intro": "Angiopteris nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched fronds that are typically green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Indonesia. Angiopteris nuda thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
