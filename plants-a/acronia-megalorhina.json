    "intro": "Acronia megalorhina, commonly known as the giant rhino orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Acronia megalorhina is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.",
