    "intro": "Aster adsurgens, commonly known as the jumping plantain, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Aster adsurgens is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the seeds are encased in a structure that can \"jump\" short distances when mature."
