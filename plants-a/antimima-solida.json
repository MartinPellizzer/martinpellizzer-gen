    "intro": "Antimima solida, commonly known as the hardy groundcover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, woody stems that form a mat-like structure, helping to prevent soil erosion. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and yellow, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Antimima solida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
