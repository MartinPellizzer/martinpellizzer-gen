It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.
