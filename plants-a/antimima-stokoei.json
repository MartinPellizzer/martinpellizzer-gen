    "intro": "Antimima stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's ant plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, red-brown, ant-like structures that are actually specialized leaves called pseudobracts. These structures serve as a protective mechanism, housing and nurturing ants that live in symbiosis with the plant. The plant's botanical features include its upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Antimima stokoei is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological relationship with ants, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
