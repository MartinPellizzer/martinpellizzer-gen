    "intro": "Aconitum glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Aconitum glaberrimum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
