    "intro": "Astragalus jubatus var. semiglaber, commonly known as the smooth-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with stipules and small, oblong leaflets that are densely covered with short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
