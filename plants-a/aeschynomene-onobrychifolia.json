    "intro": "Aeschynomene onobrychifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf desmodium, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor soil conditions due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and has potential agricultural applications."
