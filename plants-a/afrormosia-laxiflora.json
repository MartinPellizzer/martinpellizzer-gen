    "intro": "Afrormosia laxiflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dark, dense wood and fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers are typically yellow or orange with red veins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
