    "intro": "Atriplex hastata var. calotheca, commonly known as saltbush or silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. This species is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
