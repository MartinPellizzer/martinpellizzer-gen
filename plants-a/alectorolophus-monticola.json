    "intro": "Alectorolophus monticola, commonly known as the mountain larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are often hairy. Alectorolophus monticola plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
