    "intro": "Aspidium levyi, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant is native to Africa, particularly in regions with moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are often covered in small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Aspidium levyi is valued in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
