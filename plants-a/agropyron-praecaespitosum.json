    "intro": "Agropyron praecaespitosum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. Agropyron praecaespitosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
