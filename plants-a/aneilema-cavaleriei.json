    "intro": "Aneilema cavaleriei, commonly known as the Congo flame or flame plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to Central and Western Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aneilema cavaleriei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
