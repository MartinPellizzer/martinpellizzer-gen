    "intro": "Atriplex glomulifera, commonly known as the clustered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its specific epithet \"glomulifera.\" It is adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland saltbush habitats. Atriplex glomulifera plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
