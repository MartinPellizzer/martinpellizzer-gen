    "intro": "Aubrieta erubescens f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved aubrieta, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a cheerful splash of color to gardens. The foliage consists of narrow, dark green leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. This cultivar is valued for its hardiness, ability to thrive in full sun, and suitability for rock gardens or as edging plants. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
