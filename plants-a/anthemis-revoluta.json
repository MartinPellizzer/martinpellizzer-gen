    "intro": "Anthemis revoluta, commonly known as the hoary anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Anthemis revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
