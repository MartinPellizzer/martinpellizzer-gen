    "intro": "Ardisia stonei, commonly known as the Hawaiian ardisia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers followed by bright red berries that are a striking feature of the species. Ardisia stonei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some tropical gardens, though it is primarily of ecological significance in its native habitat."
