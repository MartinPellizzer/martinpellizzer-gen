    "intro": "Aristida divulsa, commonly known as the slender threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is adapted to arid environments with low water requirements. The species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging conditions."
