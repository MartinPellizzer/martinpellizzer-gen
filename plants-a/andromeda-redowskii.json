    "intro": "Andromeda redowskii, commonly known as the red spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The botanical features of Andromeda redowskii make it an important component of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
