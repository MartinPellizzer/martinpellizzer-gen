    "intro": "Asplenium sarelii var. pekinense, commonly known as the Peking spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on the bark of trees or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is native to eastern Asia and is often found in temperate forests with high humidity."
