It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization. Astragalus tokachiensis is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
