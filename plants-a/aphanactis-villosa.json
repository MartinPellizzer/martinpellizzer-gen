    "intro": "Aphanactis villosa, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the presence of a thick, cottony layer of fungal hyphae. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator of environmental health."
