    "intro": "Acantholimon compactum, commonly known as the dwarf flaxflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in full sun. Acantholimon compactum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",

This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often associated with mountainous terrain. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its native distribution reflects its ecological niche in the steppe and desert environments of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon compactum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is often found in coastal regions and inland deserts where it can thrive in arid conditions. This plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. Its compact growth habit and attractive blue-gray foliage make it a desirable ornamental plant. However, it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
