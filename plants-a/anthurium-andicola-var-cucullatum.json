    "intro": "Anthurium andicola var. cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded anthurium, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish hue. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose a spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
