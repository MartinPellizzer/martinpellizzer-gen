    "intro": "Allium tenuiflorum, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, and it produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It grows up to 1 meter in height and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed."
