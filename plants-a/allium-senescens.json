    "intro": "Allium senescens, commonly known as the purple onion, is a perennial plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and clusters of spherical, purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bulbs that are often used in cooking, similar to other allium species. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, and they emit a strong onion scent when crushed. Allium senescens is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and culinary uses."
