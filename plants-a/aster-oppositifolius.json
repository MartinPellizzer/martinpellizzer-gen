    "intro": "Aster oppositifolius, commonly known as the opposite-leaf aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Aster oppositifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
