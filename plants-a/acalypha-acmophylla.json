This plant is commonly found in regions with moist, tropical or subtropical climates. It thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Acalypha acmophylla is often seen in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely linked to the diverse ecosystems of these regions in southern and central China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha acmophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential environmental weed due to its ability to thrive in disturbed areas. Its distribution is primarily limited to the North Island, though it has been reported in some regions of the South Island as well."
