    "intro": "Agrostis canina f. vinealis, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus native to temperate regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming grass characterized by its fine, dense foliage and rhizomatous growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
