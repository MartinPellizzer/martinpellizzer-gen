    "intro": "Andropogon hypogynus var. genuinus, commonly known as the tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color, containing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of prairie and woodland ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an important forage plant and a valuable species for ecological restoration."
