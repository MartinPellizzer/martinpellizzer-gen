    "intro": "Apium crispum, commonly known as curled parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often curled or fringed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its aromatic leaves are used in cooking, particularly in soups and sauces, and it has a long history of culinary and medicinal use. Apium crispum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
