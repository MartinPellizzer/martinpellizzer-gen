    "intro": "Asclepias longipetala, commonly known as the long-petalled milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a common feature among milkweed species. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. Asclepias longipetala plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
