    "intro": "Abuta panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian abuta, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, clustered yellowish flowers. Abuta panamensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.",
