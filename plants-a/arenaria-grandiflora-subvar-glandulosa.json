    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora subvar. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers throughout the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its subspecies designation, *glandulosa*, refers to the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves. This hardy species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in xeriscaping."
