    "intro": "Aloe megalacantha subsp. alticola, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
