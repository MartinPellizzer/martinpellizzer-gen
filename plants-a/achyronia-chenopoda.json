    "intro": "Achyronia chenopoda, commonly known as silverleaf goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters. The leaves are alternate, ovate to rhombic in shape, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs that give the plant its common name. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal spikes, while the fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule containing several seeds. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.",
