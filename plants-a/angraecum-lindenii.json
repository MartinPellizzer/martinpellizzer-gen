    "intro": "Angraecum lindenii, commonly known as the Lindley's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a unique addition to specialized orchid collections. Angraecum lindenii is also notable for its historical significance in the development of Darwin's theory of natural selection."
