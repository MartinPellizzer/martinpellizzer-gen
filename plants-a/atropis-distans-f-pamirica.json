    "intro": "Atropis distans f. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir mountain gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect excess sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
