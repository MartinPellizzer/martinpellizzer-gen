    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 claudio-politana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chicory yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive composite flowers. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, often white or pinkish flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Achillea \u00d7 claudio-politana is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators.",
