It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately divided and have a somewhat fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Aralia lucida is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
