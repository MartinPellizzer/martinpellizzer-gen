    "intro": "Anthericum nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in wetland ecosystems. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as marshes and along stream banks."
