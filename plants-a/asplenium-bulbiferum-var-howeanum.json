    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum var. howeanum, commonly known as the Howean maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble the shape of a fern's traditional form. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or shaded substrates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
