It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. Aspidium bantamense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
