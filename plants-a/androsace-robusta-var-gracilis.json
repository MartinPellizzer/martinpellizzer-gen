    "intro": "Androsace robusta var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings."
