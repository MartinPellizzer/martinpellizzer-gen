    "intro": "Aspidium yoshinagae, commonly known as Yoshinaga's water fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
