    "intro": "Aloe meruana, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear yellow flowers during the warmer months. Aloe meruana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
