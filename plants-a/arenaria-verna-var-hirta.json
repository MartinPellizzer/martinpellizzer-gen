    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. hirta, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
