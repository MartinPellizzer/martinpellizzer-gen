    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. puberula, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a subspecies of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
