It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
