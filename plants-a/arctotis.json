    "intro": "Arctotis, commonly known as the \"frost of autumn,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to red and purple. Arctotis species typically have hairy, lance-shaped leaves and are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them popular choices for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Many species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
