    "intro": "Acacia lanigera var. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.",

This variant of the species is commonly found in the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lanigera var. lanigera was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, typically found in regions of southern Africa. It thrives in open woodlands and grasslands where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has been introduced to several countries beyond its native range, including parts of Australia and the United States. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments."
