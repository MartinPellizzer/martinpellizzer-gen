It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ibarrense was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in urban settings, along roadsides, and in abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in many regions. It can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances in local ecosystems."
