    "intro": "Apetahia raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical trees. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit's unique appearance and flavor have made it a subject of interest for both botanists and local communities. However, due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
