It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
