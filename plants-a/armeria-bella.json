    "intro": "Armeria bella, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. Armeria bella is often used in garden landscapes for its hardiness and ornamental value."
