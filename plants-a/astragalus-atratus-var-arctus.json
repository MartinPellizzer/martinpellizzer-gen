It is characterized by its erect stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its root system is deep and fibrous, contributing to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility."
