    "intro": "Asplenium subglandulosum subsp. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish spleenwort, is a fern species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, glandular hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various microhabitats and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
