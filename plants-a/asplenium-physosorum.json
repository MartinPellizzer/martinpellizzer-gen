    "intro": "Asplenium physosorum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium physosorum is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator species for certain microhabitats."
