    "intro": "Alnus sibirica, commonly known as Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. Siberian alder is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
