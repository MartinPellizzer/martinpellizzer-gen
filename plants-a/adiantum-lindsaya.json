    "intro": "Adiantum lindsaya, commonly known as the Lind's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Adiantum lindsaya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
