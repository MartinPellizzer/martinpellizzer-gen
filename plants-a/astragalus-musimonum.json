    "intro": "Astragalus musimonum, commonly known as the Kashmir milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces pod fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
