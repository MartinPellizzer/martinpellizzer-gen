    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-ribbed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
