    "intro": "Amaranthus nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
