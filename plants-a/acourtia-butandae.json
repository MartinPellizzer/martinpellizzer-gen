    "intro": "Acourtia butandae, commonly known as the Butan Valley acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its environment. Acourtia butandae is a perennial herb with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",
