    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf pink or moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention and protection from harsh weather. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
