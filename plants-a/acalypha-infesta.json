    "intro": "Acalypha infesta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, red or orange capsules. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Acalypha infesta is an important species in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha infesta is primarily native to Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, and Peru. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Acalypha infesta is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along riverbanks and in secondary growth areas. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across Latin America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha infesta was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several countries across Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some areas. However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local environment and management practices."
