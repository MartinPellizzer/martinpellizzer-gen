    "intro": "Alchemilla pycnantha, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Alchemilla pycnantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
