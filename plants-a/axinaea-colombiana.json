    "intro": "Axinaea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian axinaea, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are clustered in cymes, often displaying white or pale pink hues. Axinaea colombiana produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
