    "intro": "Alyssum orbiculatum, commonly known as the globe alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces spherical, rounded seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alyssum orbiculatum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
