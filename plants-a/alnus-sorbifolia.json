    "intro": "Alnus sorbifolia, commonly known as the European alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus sorbifolia has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
