    "intro": "Antidesma membranifolium, commonly known as the paper-leaved antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thin, membranous leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique foliage and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
