    "intro": "Avena muralis, commonly known as wall oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often along walls or in crevices, which is reflected in its common name. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous husk, and the plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Avena muralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and soil-stabilizing properties."
