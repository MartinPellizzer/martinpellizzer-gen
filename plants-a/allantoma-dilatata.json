    "intro": "Allantoma dilatata, commonly known as the inflated allantoid, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods that resemble small, balloon-like structures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces showy, yellowish flowers during the dry season. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allantoma dilatata is considered a species of conservation concern."
