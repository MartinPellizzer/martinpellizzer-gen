    "intro": "Aristolochia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, and often twisted leaves that resemble a pipe, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, but A. gardneri stands out for its specific habitat preferences and distinctive floral structure."
