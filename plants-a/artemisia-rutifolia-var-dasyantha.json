    "intro": "Artemisia rutifolia var. dasyantha, commonly known as the roughleaf sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has silvery-white, woolly hairs on its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in semi-arid regions."
