    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis var. fallax, commonly known as fallax ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent ground cover for woodland gardens."
