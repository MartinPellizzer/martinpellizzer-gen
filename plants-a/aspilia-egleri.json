    "intro": "Aspilia egleri, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, daisy-like inflorescences composed of white ray florets and yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aspilia egleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
