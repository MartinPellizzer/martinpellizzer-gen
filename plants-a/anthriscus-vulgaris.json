    "intro": "Anthriscus vulgaris, commonly known as hedge garlic, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Anthriscus vulgaris is also valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
