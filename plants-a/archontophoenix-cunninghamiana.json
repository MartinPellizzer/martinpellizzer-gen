    "intro": "Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, single-stemmed tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It features a fibrous, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous husk that protects the inner core. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. Its most notable feature is the production of coconuts, which develop from large, fragrant flowers. The coconut palm is highly valued for its economic and ecological contributions in tropical ecosystems."
