    "intro": "Alchemilla mollis f. catillaris, commonly known as the cat's tail alpine sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
