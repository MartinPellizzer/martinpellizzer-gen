    "intro": "Artemisia norvegica var. piceetorum, commonly known as the Norway mugwort, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Due to its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional remedies, it has been the subject of various botanical and pharmacological studies."
