    "intro": "Asteromoea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf asteromoea, is a small flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
