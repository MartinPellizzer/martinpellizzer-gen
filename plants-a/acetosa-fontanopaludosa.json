It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in muddy or waterlogged soils, often in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Acetosa fontanopaludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",
