    "intro": "Apinagia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf apinagia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Apinagia leptophylla is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat."
