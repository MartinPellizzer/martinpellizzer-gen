    "intro": "Alnus incana var. virescens, commonly known as the green alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually a bright green, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules containing Frankia bacteria. This characteristic makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
