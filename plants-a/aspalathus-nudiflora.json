    "intro": "Aspalathus nudiflora, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are not showy but are important for its reproductive cycle. Its most notable feature is the unique, sweetly flavored leaves used to make the popular herbal tea. Aspalathus nudiflora thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate to flourish."
