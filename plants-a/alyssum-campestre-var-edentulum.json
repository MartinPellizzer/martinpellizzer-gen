It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, toothless leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of Alyssum campestre."
