    "intro": "Ambrosia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments. Its pollen is a significant allergen, contributing to seasonal allergies in some regions. Despite its allergenic properties, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems."
