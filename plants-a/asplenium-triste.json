    "intro": "Asplenium triste, commonly known as the sad fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually a dark green color. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium triste is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
