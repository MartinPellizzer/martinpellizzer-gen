    "intro": "Agrostis extensa, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
