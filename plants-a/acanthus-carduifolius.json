    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus carduifolius is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas, cliffs, and dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime environments. It is also present in some regions of southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus carduifolius was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and architectural appearance. It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. Despite its ornamental use, it has shown potential to become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in non-native habitats."
