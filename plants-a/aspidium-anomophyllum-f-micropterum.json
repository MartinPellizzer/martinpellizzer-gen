    "intro": "Aspidium anomophyllum f. micropterum, commonly known as the small-winged water fern, is a fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. This fern is notable for its unique morphological variation, particularly in the reduced size and shape of its pinnae."
