It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant red or orange hues. Anthopterus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
