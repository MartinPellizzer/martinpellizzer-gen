It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, pungent scent. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural insect repellents."
