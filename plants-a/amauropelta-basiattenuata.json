    "intro": "Amauropelta basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and slightly tapered at the base. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
