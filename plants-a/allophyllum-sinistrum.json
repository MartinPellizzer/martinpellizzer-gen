    "intro": "Allophyllum sinistrum, commonly known as the left-handed alpine shrub, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Allophyllum sinistrum is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
