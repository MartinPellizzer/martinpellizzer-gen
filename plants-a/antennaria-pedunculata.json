    "intro": "Antennaria pedunculata, commonly known as the hooked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes and disturbed areas. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to establish quickly in nutrient-poor environments. Antennaria pedunculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
