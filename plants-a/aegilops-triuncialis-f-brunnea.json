It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dull green to brownish color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896 (glumes) and lemma-like structures, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. This subspecies is notable for its potential in forage and its historical use in the development of modern wheat varieties."
