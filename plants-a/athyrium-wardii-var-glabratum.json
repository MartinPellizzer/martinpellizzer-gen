    "intro": "Athyrium wardii var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a graceful, arching form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
