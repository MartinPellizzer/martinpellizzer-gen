    "intro": "Armeria villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of western Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of bright white, pink, or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has silvery-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
