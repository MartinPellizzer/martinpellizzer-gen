    "intro": "Angraecum elegans, commonly known as the star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms at night, a unique trait that aligns with its pollination by the giant hawkmoth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Angraecum elegans is prized for its beauty and rarity, making it a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
