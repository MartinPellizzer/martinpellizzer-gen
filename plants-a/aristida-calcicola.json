    "intro": "Aristida calcicola, commonly known as the limestone dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those with a high calcium content, which is reflected in its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family. It is drought-tolerant and often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
