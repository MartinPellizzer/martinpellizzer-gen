    "intro": "Azorella biloba var. strigosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a hardy perennial belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, such as high-altitude regions and rocky soils, due to its ability to retain moisture and withstand extreme temperatures. Its flowers are small and white, typically arranged in a single umbel at the center of the plant. Azorella biloba var. strigosa is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades in its native habitat."
