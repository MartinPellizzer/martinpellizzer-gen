    "intro": "Alsine brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by tiny, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Alsine brachycarpa is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
