    "intro": "Asplenium annobonense, commonly known as the Annobon Island spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a delicate, intricate structure typical of many spleenworts. Asplenium annobonense is native to the island of Annob\u00f3n, located in the Gulf of Guinea, and is adapted to the region's moist, shaded habitats."
