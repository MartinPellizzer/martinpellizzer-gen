    "intro": "Alatiliparis cameronica, commonly known as the Cameron's alatiliparis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture, adapting to its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
