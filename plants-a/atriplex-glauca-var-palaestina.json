    "intro": "Atriplex glauca var. palaestina, commonly known as palestinian saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
