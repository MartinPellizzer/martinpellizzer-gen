    "intro": "Astragalus albifolius, commonly known as the white-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus albifolius is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
