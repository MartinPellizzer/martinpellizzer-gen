    "intro": "Acacia tephroloba, commonly known as the white wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in spikes. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia tephroloba thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is often found in coastal regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tephroloba is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This species is adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, making it a characteristic plant of these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia tephroloba is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tephroloba was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and a warm climate, often found in regions with low rainfall. It is commonly used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential for invasive growth in native ecosystems. It is often planted for erosion control and as a ornamental species."
