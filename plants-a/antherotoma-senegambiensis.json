    "intro": "Antherotoma senegambiensis, commonly known as the African sandfly, is a small, dark-colored insect belonging to the family Psychodidae. It is characterized by its elongated body, long legs, and a proboscis used for feeding on blood. The plant-like name may be misleading, as it is not a plant but an insect. This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It plays a role in the transmission of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease affecting humans and animals."
