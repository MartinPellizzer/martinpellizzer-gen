    "intro": "Avena fragilis, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Avena fragilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
