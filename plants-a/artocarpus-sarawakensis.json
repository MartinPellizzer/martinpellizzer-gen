    "intro": "Artocarpus sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak jackfruit, is a tropical tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other fruit-bearing trees like the common jackfruit. The plant produces large, spiky fruits that are typically harvested when mature, though they are less commonly consumed compared to other Artocarpus species. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, providing shade in its natural habitat. The tree is valued for its unique fruit and its role in the local ecosystem of Borneo."
