    "intro": "Antidesma inflatum, commonly known as the inflated antidesma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit structures that resemble small, rounded capsules. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery in texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The inflated fruit is adapted for seed dispersal by animals, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitats."
