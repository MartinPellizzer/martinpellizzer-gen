    "intro": "Acer ginnala f. coccineum, commonly known as the red maple or red sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red foliage, which becomes particularly vivid in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its colorful leaves and compact growth habit.",
