    "intro": "Aragallus saximontanus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense saximontan aragallus, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
