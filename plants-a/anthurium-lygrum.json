    "intro": "Anthurium lygrum, commonly known as the red-veined anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are typically surrounded by a colorful spathe. Anthurium lygrum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
