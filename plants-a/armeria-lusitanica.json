    "intro": "Armeria lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria lusitanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild climates."
