It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife.",
