    "intro": "Astragalus tephrodes var. eurylobus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its small, lens-shaped seeds are often dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations in its native habitat."
