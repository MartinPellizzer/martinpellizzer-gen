    "intro": "Agrostis cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, spikelike inflorescence that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Agrostis cornucopiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
