    "intro": "Acer schoenermarkiae var. oxycolpum, commonly known as the Oxycolpum maple, is a rare and unique variant of the Schoener's maple. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves with a serrated margin and a striking coloration that ranges from green to reddish hues. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early spring, while its samaras (winged seeds) are produced in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.",
