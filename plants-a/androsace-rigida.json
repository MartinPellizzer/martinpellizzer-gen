    "intro": "Androsace rigida, commonly known as the rigid androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Androsace rigida is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with poor soil."
