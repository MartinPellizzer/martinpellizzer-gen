    "intro": "Aeschynomene histrix var. mucronulata, commonly known as the hairy aeschynomene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a slight reddish tinge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear the same glandular hairs. This species is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system."
