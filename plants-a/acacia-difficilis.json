    "intro": "Acacia difficilis, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are followed by woody pods containing flattened seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Acacia difficilis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia difficilis is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. Acacia difficilis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia difficilis was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. It was first recorded in the region during the late 20th century, likely through horticultural trade. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread. Efforts are now underway to manage its distribution and prevent further ecological impact."
