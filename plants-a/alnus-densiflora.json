    "intro": "Alnus densiflora, commonly known as the coast alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in catkins. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation along coastal areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and coastal forests. Alnus densiflora plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
