    "intro": "Atriplex glauca var. alexandrina, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important species for stabilizing desert landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen also contributes to soil fertility in degraded areas."
