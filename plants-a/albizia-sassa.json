    "intro": "Albizia sassa, commonly known as the silky senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its slender, often branched stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Albizia sassa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
