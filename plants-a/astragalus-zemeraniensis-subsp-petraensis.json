    "intro": "Astragalus zemeraniensis subsp. petraensis, commonly known as the Petra astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
