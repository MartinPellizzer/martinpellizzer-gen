    "intro": "Aotus gracillima, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is notable for its nocturnal blooming habit, which is a characteristic feature of many nightshade species."
