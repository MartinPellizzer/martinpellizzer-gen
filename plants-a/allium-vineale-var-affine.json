    "intro": "Allium vineale var. affine, commonly known as garlic chives, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its stems, which can be used as a propagation method. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in moist meadows or along stream banks. Garlic chives are valued for their mild garlic scent and are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
