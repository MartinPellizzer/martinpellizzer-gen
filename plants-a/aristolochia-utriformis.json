    "intro": "Aristolochia utriformis, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered invasive in some areas."
