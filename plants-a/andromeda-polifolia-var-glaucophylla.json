    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glossyleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and elliptical in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
