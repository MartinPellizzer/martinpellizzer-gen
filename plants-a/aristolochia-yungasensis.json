    "intro": "Aristolochia yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas arrow vine, is a climbing shrub native to the humid cloud forests of Bolivia and northern Argentina. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found growing along stream banks and in shaded, moist environments. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
