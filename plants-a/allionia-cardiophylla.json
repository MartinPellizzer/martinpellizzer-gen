It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture despite its limited natural range."
