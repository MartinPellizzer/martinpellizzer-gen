    "intro": "Aspidium semicordatum var. americanum, commonly known as the American water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to North America. It is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland areas. Its leaves are usually pale green, with a distinctive, semicircular shape that aids in its identification. This fern thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
