It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into several segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium retusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
