    "intro": "Aira ambigua, commonly known as the false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland environments. Aira ambigua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
