    "intro": "Acnistus plumieri, commonly known as the stinkbush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, plum-like berries. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant potentially hazardous. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies have led to its classification as a weed in some areas.",
