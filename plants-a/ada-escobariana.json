    "intro": "Ada escobariana, commonly known as the Escobaria cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Ada escobariana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.",
