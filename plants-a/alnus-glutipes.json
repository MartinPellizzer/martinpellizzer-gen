    "intro": "Alnus glutipes, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces catkin-like flowers, which are male and female, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It has a shallow root system that can fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
