It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Asplundia crassifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
