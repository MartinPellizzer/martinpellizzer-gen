    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled black alder, is a variant of the black alder native to Europe. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its flowers. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers arranged in drooping clusters. It thrives in wet or swampy areas, often forming dense stands in riparian zones. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
