    "intro": "Arthrolophis, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Arthrolophis species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, well-drained soil conditions. They are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, with Streptocarpus being a closely related genus often mistaken for Arthrolophis."
