    "intro": "Arnica fennoscandica, commonly known as Arctic mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disks, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its ecological niche in high-altitude and polar habitats."
