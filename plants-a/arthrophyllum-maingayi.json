    "intro": "Arthrophyllum maingayi, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, white daisies. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in cold, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in clusters, giving it a delicate and ethereal appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
