    "intro": "Ampelopsis megalophylla, commonly known as the giant leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its vigorous growth makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
