    "intro": "Arctanthemum arcticum subsp. kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions, including parts of Siberia, Alaska, and the Kuril Islands. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
