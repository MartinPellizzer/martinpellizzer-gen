    "intro": "Anthurium luteolum, commonly known as the yellow anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces bright yellow spathes that enclose its spadix, which is covered in tiny, red to orange-colored flowers. Anthurium luteolum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
