    "intro": "Asplenium fimbriatum var. foliolosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
