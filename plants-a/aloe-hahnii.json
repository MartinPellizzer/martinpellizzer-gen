    "intro": "Aloe hahnii, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail,\" is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of dark green leaves with white-tipped margins that resemble a lion's tail. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Aloe hahnii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
