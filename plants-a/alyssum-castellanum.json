    "intro": "Alyssum castellanum, commonly known as rock allyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum castellanum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
