    "intro": "Asphodelus microcarpus f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its botanical features make it well-suited for maritime environments and ecological restoration projects."
