    "intro": "Acantholimon stocksii var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate acantholimon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring or early summer. It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-like) lobes on the leaf bases. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.",

It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as coastal bluffs, grasslands, and sagebrush steppe. This variety thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon stocksii var. auriculatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as slopes and gravelly plains. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
