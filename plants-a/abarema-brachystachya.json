It is commonly found in the states of Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Paran\u00e1. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. It is typically associated with understory vegetation in dense forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema brachystachya was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion along riverbanks and slopes. Its introduction has helped restore vegetation in areas affected by deforestation. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target environments."
