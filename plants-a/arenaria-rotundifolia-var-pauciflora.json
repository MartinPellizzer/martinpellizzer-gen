    "intro": "Arenaria rotundifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
