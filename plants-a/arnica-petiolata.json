It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica petiolata is valued for its medicinal properties, though its use requires caution due to potential skin irritation."
