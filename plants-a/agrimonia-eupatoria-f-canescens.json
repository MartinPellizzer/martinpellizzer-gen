    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria f. canescens, commonly known as the hairy agrimony, is a variant of the agrimony plant characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and stems. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in dry grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. Its hairy texture is a key identifying feature, distinguishing it from other forms of agrimony. This plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
