    "intro": "Aspidium foenisecii, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp woodlands. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Aspidium foenisecii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
