    "intro": "Alsodeia aucuparia, commonly known as the yellow alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Alsodeia aucuparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
