    "intro": "Abutilon patens, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon patens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is also known to grow in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its native range extends from the southern United States down through the Andes and into northern Argentina.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon patens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there by humans for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or medicinal purposes. Despite its non-native status, it has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or coastal environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems, though it is not currently considered a major invasive species."
