    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astelea menziesiana var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender astelia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in shaded garden settings."
