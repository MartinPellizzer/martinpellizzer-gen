    "intro": "Athyrium dombeyi, commonly known as the Dombey's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the fern life cycle."
