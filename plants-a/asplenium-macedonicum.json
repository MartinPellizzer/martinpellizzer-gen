    "intro": "Asplenium macedonicum, commonly known as the Macedonian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely packed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Asplenium macedonicum is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of humid microhabitats."
