    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. levis, commonly known as soft oat or meadow oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its seeds are often used as forage for livestock due to their high nutritional value. The subspecies is distinguished by its more delicate and less rigid structure compared to other oat varieties."
