    "intro": "Abies vejarii var. vejarii, commonly known as the Vejarii fir, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying alpine forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies vejarii var. vejarii is primarily native to Mexico Northeast. This variant of the white fir is found in the mountainous regions of northeastern Mexico. It thrives in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. The plant is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of this region. Its natural range is limited to these areas, making it a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies vejarii var. vejarii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes where its ornamental value and hardy nature are appreciated. This variety is known for its conical shape and dense foliage, making it a popular choice for both residential and commercial landscaping. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, where it can grow to impressive heights. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range, contributing to its widespread cultivation."
