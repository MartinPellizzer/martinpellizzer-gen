    "intro": "Aspidium aemulum, commonly known as the lesser chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Aspidium aemulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
