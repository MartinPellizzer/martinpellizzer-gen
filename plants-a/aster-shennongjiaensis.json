    "intro": "Aster shennongjiaensis, commonly known as the Shennongjia aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the Shennongjia Mountains in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant is distinguished by its violet-blue flowers and hairy leaves, which help it adapt to the cool, moist climate of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in high-altitude forests and is considered an endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
