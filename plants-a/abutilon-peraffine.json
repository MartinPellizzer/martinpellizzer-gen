It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. This plant is commonly found in lowland areas, often near water sources like rivers and wetlands. It prefers well-drained soils and is often seen growing in disturbed habitats or along forest edges. Abutilon peraffine is a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon peraffine was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soil and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been reported in several tropical and subtropical countries, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain environments."
