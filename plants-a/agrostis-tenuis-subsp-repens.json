    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis subsp. repens, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. This species is often considered a weed in turfgrass settings but plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
