    "intro": "Ardisia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran ardisia, is a member of the Myrsaceae family and is native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub that typically grows in lowland tropical rainforests. The plant features glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it is not as widely grown as other ardisia species. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
