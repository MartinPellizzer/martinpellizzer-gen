    "intro": "Acacia collinsii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are composed of numerous thread-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia collinsii is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. It is an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for bees and other pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia collinsii is primarily native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal and near-coastal areas, particularly in the Geraldton and Esperance regions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal heathlands and dunes. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Acacia collinsii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia collinsii was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia, including Western Australia and South Australia. However, its spread can sometimes lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly."
