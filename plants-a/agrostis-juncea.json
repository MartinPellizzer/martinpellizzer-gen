    "intro": "Agrostis juncea, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in erosion control. Agrostis juncea is also a forage plant for livestock and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
