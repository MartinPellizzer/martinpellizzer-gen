    "intro": "Aporuellia acaulis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous stalked aporuellia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, unbranched stem and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its habitat is limited to moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
