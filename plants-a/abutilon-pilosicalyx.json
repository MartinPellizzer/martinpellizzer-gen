    "intro": "Abutilon pilosicalyx, commonly known as the silky abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. It produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pilosicalyx is primarily native to Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pilosicalyx was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has since become naturalized in several regions, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats."
