    "intro": "Amauropelta serrulata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have serrated margins, contributing to its common name. Amauropelta serrulata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
