    "intro": "Alchemilla barbulata, commonly known as the woolly lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla barbulata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
