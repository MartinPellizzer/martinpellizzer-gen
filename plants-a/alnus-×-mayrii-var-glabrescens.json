    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 mayrii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a hybrid species within the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
