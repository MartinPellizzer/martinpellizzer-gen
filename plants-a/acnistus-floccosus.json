It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, which contribute to its common name. Acnistus floccosus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in coastal or inland areas with limited water availability.",
