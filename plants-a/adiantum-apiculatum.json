    "intro": "Adiantum apiculatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Adiantum apiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
