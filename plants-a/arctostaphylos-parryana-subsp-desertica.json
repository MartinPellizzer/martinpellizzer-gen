    "intro": "Arctostaphylos parryana subsp. desertica, commonly known as the desert manzanita, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control in sandy or rocky soils."
