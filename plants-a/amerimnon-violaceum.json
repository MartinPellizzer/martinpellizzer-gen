    "intro": "Amerimnon violaceum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often tinged with a purple hue, especially when mature. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Amerimnon violaceum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, fields, and streambanks."
