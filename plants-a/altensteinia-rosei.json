    "intro": "Altensteinia rosei, commonly known as the rose-like altensteinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in shaded, moist environments. Altensteinia rosei is known for its ornamental value and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
