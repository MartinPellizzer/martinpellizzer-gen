    "intro": "Alisma stellatum, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wet soil environments. Alisma stellatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
