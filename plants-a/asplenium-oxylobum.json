    "intro": "Asplenium oxylobum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a finely toothed margin, and it produces spores in clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium oxylobum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
