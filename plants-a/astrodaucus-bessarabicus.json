    "intro": "Astrodaucus bessarabicus, commonly known as the Bessarabian starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, star-shaped blooms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
