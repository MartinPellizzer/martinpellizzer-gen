    "intro": "Atropa mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean belladonna, is a toxic plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features striking bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy texture, and it produces dark, glossy berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its poisonous nature, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
