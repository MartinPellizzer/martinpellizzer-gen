    "intro": "Avenula bromoides subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian false oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stems, and it flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Avenula bromoides subsp. australis is adapted to temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
