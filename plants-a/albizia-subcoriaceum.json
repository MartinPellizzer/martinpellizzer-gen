    "intro": "Albizia subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-skin acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, sandy soils. Albizia subcoriaceum is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
