    "intro": "Atraphaxis candida, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Atraphaxis candida is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
