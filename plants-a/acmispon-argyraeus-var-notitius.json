    "intro": "Acmispon argyraeus var. notitius, commonly known as the silverleaf mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its deep root system allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.",
