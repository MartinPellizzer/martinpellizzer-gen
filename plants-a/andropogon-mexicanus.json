    "intro": "Andropogon mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, blue-green leaves that give it its common name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces panicles of small, white to bluish flowers in the summer months. Andropogon mexicanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
