    "intro": "Angraecum ealaense, commonly known as the Eala's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
