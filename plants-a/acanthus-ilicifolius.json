    "intro": "Acanthus ilicifolius, commonly known as the holly-leaved acanthus, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble holly leaves, with a distinctive lobed structure and a rough, textured surface. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its historical use in classical art and architecture further highlights its cultural significance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus ilicifolius is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas, cliffs, and dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime environments. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Turkey. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ilicifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic qualities. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to colonize a variety of habitats. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems from its impact."
