    "intro": "Androsace gorodkovii, commonly known as the Siberian snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Androsace gorodkovii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
