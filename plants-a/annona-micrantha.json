    "intro": "Annona micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers with five white to pale yellow petals and a distinctive yellow-green calyx. Its fruit, which is usually pear-shaped, has a rough, greenish-brown skin and a creamy, sweet pulp. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental value."
