    "intro": "Arnica caudata, commonly known as the trailing arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that bear yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers, typical of the sunflower family. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
