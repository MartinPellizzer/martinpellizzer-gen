    "intro": "Anthurium regnellianum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with prominent veins. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose a spadix, which is the actual flowering structure. Anthurium regnellianum thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
