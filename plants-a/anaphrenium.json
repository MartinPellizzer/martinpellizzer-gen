    "intro": "Anaphrenium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Anaphrenium thrives in specific, humid tropical environments, often in the understory of dense forests. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered in many regions."
