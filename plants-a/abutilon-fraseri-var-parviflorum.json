It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as forests, shrublands, and disturbed sites. It is often associated with secondary growth and can be found along roadsides and in cultivated areas. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fraseri var. parviflorum was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
