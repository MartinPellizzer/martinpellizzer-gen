    "intro": "Achillea trevidiciana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.",
