It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus ortholobus is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations."
