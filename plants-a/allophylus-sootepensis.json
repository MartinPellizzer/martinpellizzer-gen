    "intro": "Allophylus sootepensis, commonly known as the Sootep alder, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible for some bird species. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
