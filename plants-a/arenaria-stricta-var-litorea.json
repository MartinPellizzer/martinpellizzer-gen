    "intro": "Arenaria stricta var. litorea, commonly known as coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores where it withstands harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
