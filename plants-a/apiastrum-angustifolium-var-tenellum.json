    "intro": "Apiastrum angustifolium var. tenellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apiastrum, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
