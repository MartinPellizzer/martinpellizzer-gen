It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that resemble those of the common dandelion. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its most distinctive feature is the elongated, whip-like appearance of its leaves, which gives it its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
