    "intro": "Artemisia cephalantha, commonly known as blue mist shrub, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It contains essential oils and has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss."
