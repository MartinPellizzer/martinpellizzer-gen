    "intro": "Aplotaxis auriculata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"poison bush.\" Aplotaxis auriculata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
