    "intro": "Acanthophippium odoratum, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne on a short inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its unique structure and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium odoratum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as coastal cliffs, limestone outcrops, and scrublands. This plant is commonly found in countries like Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates with poor soil conditions. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium odoratum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has shown adaptability to various climates, contributing to its spread in non-native regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, it is not currently classified as a major threat to native flora in most areas."
