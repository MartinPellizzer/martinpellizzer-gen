    "intro": "Arabis propinqua, commonly known as the rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
