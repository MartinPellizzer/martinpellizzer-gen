    "intro": "Anastrophus furcatus, commonly known as the forked anastrophus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive forked inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are compound and finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
