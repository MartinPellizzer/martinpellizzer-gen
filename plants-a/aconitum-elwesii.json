    "intro": "Aconitum elwesii, commonly known as Elwes' aconite, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately compound leaves with finely divided lobes, and its roots are highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
