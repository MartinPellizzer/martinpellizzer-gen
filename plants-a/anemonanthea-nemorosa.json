    "intro": "Anemonanthea nemorosa, commonly known as the forest anemone, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Anemonanthea nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
