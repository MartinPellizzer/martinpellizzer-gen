It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a central yellow flower surrounded by radiating white or pale blue petals, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.
