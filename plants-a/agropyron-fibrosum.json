    "intro": "Agropyron fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow,\u575a\u97e7 (fibrous), and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Agropyron fibrosum is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
