It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, specifically in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and parts of Coahuila. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with humid environments and is often found in secondary forests and open areas. Its natural range is limited to this specific geographic region in Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon procerum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often considered an invasive species in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenge for native plant communities. It is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
