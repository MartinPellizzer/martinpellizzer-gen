    "intro": "Aralia spectabilis, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are palmately divided, with each leaf consisting of 5 to 7 lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it has a tendency to form colonies through root sprouting. Aralia spectabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
