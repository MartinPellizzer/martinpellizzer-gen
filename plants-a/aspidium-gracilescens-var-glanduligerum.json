    "intro": "Aspidium gracilescens var. glanduligerum, commonly known as the glandular aspidium, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features small, glandular structures on its leaves, which may aid in water retention or defense against herbivores. Its rhizomes are typically short and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance."
