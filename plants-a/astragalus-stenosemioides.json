    "intro": "Astragalus stenosemioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions and making it resilient to drought. Astragalus stenosemioides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
