    "intro": "Agropyron nomokonovii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in alpine and arctic regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
