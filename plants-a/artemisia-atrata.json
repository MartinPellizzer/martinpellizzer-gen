    "intro": "Artemisia atrata, commonly known as black sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, pungent scent. Artemisia atrata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
