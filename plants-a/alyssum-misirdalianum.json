It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Alyssum misirdalianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
