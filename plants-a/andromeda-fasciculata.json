    "intro": "Andromeda fasciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a sharp, acidic flavor. Andromeda fasciculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
