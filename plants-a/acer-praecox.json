    "intro": "Acer praecox, commonly known as the early maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age. Acer praecox is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions.",
