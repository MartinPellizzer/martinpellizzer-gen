    "intro": "Aster altaicus var. decrescens, commonly known as the Altai aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often woody at the base. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native environment."
