    "intro": "Artemisia abaensis, commonly known as the ABA Artemisia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its aromatic, often silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in composite heads, a common feature among members of its family. Artemisia abaensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. Its essential oils, derived from its leaves, have been traditionally used in local medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
