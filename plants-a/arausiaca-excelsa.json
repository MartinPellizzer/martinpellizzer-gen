    "intro": "Arausiaca excelsa, commonly known as the giant alpine aster, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Arausiaca excelsa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
