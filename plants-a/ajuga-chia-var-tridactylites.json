    "intro": "Ajuga chia var. tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a compact, lush carpet of foliage throughout the growing season."
