    "intro": "Albuca coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved albuca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Albuca coarctata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
