    "intro": "Anticlea mogollonensis, commonly known as the Mogollon's antclea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Anticlea mogollonensis is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
