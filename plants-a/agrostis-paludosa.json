    "intro": "Agrostis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, slightly hairy stems that often lie flat or are slightly arching. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green coloration. Agrostis paludosa is adapted to moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of wetlands."
