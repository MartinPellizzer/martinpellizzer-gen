    "intro": "Alsophila cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, slender trunk with a fibrous, rough surface and large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are dark green and have a distinctive, heart-shaped base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
