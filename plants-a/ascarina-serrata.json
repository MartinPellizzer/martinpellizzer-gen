    "intro": "Ascarina serrata, commonly known as the New Zealand rimu, is a tall evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araucariaceae family and is characterized by its straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces large, conifer-like cones and has distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. It plays a significant ecological role in New Zealand's forests, providing habitat and food for various native species. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to pests, it is considered a vulnerable species."
