    "intro": "Athyrium affine, commonly known as the common lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that typically grow to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Athyrium affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
