    "intro": "Asplenium neglectum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure that facilitates spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Asplenium neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with proper humidity and drainage."
