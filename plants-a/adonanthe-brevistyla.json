    "intro": "Adonanthe brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled adonanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adonanthe brevistyla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
