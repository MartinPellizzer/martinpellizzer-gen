    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. marschlinsii, commonly known as the Marschlins' sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or maritime climates. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand salt spray make it a hardy species adapted to extreme conditions."
