    "intro": "Astragalus rubyi, commonly known as the red milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces vibrant violet to red flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. Astragalus rubyi is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
