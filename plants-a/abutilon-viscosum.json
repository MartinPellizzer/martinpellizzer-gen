    "intro": "Abutilon viscosum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in some regions.",

This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and can be found in open woodlands, coastal dunes, and along roadsides. The species is well adapted to warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Its native range spans across much of the Americas, from the Caribbean to South America and parts of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon viscosum was mainly introduced to French Guiana. It is a species native to the Americas but has been established in various regions outside its native range. In French Guiana, it is often found growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open areas. The plant is known for its sticky leaves and showy flowers, which can make it a common sight in local ecosystems. Its introduction may have ecological implications due to its ability to thrive in diverse environments."
