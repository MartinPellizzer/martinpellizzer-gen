    "intro": "Aster arenarius f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sand aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its white flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, adding a striking visual contrast to the surrounding landscape. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, which set it apart from the typical blue or purple flowers of the species."
