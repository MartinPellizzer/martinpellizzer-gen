    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. mucronatum, commonly known as the serrated lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated fronds. This fern is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching form that adds aesthetic value to gardens and natural landscapes. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant foliage."
