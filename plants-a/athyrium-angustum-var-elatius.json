    "intro": "Athyrium angustum var. elatius, commonly known as narrow fern or narrow mountain fern, is a variant of the narrow fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
