    "intro": "Agave bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish-green color and white marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellow flowers, which appear after several years of growth. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid climates. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
