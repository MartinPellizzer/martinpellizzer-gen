It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in umbrella-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or pond edges. Its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
