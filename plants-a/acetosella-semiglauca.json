    "intro": "Acetosella semiglauca, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features rosettes of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.",
