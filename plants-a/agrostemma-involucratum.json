    "intro": "Agrostemma involucratum, commonly known as the clustered flax or narrowleaf flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Camelineae tribe within the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Agrostemma involucratum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
