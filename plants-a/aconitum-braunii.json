    "intro": "Aconitum braunii, commonly known as the Braun's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that are arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aconitum braunii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
