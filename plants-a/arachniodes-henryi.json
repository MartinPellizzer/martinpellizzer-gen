    "intro": "Arachniodes henryi, commonly known as the Chinese cloud fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Arachniodes henryi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, semi-shaded conditions."
