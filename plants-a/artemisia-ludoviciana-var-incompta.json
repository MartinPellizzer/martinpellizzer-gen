It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
