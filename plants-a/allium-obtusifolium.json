    "intro": "Allium obtusifolium, commonly known as broadleaf garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its bulbous stem is surrounded by a sheath of modified leaves, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Allium obtusifolium is valued for its aromatic properties and is cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
