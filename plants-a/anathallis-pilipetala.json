    "intro": "Anathallis pilipetala, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, pale pink inflorescence and small, delicate flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, from which it gets its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
