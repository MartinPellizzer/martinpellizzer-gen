    "intro": "Allantodia virescens var. okinawaensis, commonly known as the Okinawa green allantodia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale green to white flowers that are often tinged with pink. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
