It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowering stems are usually short and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
