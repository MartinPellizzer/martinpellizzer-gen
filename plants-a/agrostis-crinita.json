    "intro": "Agrostis crinita, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
