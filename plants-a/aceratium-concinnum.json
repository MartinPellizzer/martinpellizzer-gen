    "intro": "Aceratium concinnum, commonly known as the small-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in early spring. Aceratium concinnum is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.",
