    "intro": "Asterophorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, Asterophorum is listed as an endangered species."
