    "intro": "Astragalus echinus subsp. arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
