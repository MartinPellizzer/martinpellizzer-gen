    "intro": "Ajuga diemenica, commonly known as the Tasmanian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Tasmania. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Ajuga diemenica is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
