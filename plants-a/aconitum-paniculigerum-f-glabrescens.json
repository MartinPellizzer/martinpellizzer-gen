It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a panicle. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The f. glabrescens form is notable for its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical species.",
