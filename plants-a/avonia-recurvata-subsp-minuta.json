It features compact, dense foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
