    "intro": "Actaea muliensis, commonly known as the Yunnan actaea, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",
