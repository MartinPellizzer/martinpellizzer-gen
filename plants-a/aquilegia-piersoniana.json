    "intro": "Aquilegia piersoniana, commonly known as the Pierson's columbine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds. Aquilegia piersoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
