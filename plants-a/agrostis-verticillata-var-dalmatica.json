    "intro": "Agrostis verticillata var. dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
