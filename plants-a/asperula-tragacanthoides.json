It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Asperula tragacanthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
