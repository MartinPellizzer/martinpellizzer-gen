    "intro": "Astragalus adpreseipilosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Astragalus adpreseipilosus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
