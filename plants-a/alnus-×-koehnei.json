    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 koehnei, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is a natural hybrid between *Alnus incana* (gray alder) and *Alnus rhombifolia* (broadleaf alder). The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Alnus \u00d7 koehnei is often found in moist soils near streams or in wetlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
