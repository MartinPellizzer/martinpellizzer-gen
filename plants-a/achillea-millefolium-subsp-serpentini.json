    "intro": "Achillea millefolium subsp. serpentini, commonly known as serpent's grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow to cream-colored flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical A. millefolium. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",
