    "intro": "Andropogon sericatus, commonly known as silky grass or silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose (hairy) leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are tall and erect, bearing small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon sericatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
