    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 pagesii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a rare and sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a distinctive shield-like shape, and its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant lacks true flowers and reproduces through spores, which are produced on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
