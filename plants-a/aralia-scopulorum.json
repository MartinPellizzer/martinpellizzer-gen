    "intro": "Aralia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock aralia, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately divided into 5\u20139 leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Aralia scopulorum has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
