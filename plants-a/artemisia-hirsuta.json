    "intro": "Artemisia hirsuta, commonly known as rough wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and strong aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its small, yellowish-green flower heads appear in late summer and are clustered in panicles. Artemisia hirsuta is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
