It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
