    "intro": "Atriplex patula subsp. patula, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal areas of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
