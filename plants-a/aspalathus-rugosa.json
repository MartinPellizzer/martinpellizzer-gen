    "intro": "Aspalathus rugosa, commonly known as rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and thrives in regions with low rainfall. Its most notable feature is its unique reddish-brown tea, which is produced from the dried and processed leaves. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural practices."
