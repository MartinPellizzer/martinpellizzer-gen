    "intro": "Abies umbilicata, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, needle-like leaves that are typically light green, and its distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it produces a fragrant resin that is used in various traditional and commercial applications.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies umbilicata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is commonly found in temperate forest ecosystems at high elevations. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is adapted to rocky or mountainous terrain. Its natural range extends across several mountain ranges in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies umbilicata was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across the northeastern and northwestern United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to manage its distribution to prevent invasion of native ecosystems."
