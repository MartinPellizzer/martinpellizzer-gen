This cultivar is a variation of the peach tree characterized by its showy, double blooms that feature multiple layers of petals. The flowers are typically pink or white, adding ornamental value to the tree. It is primarily grown for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit. The plant retains the typical growth habits of the peach tree, with a rounded canopy and thorny branches."
