    "intro": "Armeria sabulosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Armeria sabulosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
