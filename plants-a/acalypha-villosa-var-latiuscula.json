    "intro": "Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula, commonly known as silky ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are usually borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which contribute to its ornamental value in gardens.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It thrives in humid climates and is typically found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant is known for its hairy foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha villosa var. latiuscula was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats. It thrives in environments with moderate to high moisture levels. This plant is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
