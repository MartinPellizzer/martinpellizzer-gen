    "intro": "Asplenidictyum curtidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a soft, leathery texture. The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
