    "intro": "Andromeda laurina, commonly known as the wintergreen shrub, is a deciduous evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Its aromatic leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent. The shrub is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
