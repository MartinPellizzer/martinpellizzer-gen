    "intro": "Anisophyllea bakoensis, commonly known as the Bako anisophyllea, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with alternating leaflets. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in the humid and shaded conditions of the forest floor. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for some wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
