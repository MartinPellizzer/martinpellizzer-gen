    "intro": "Astragalus hystrix, commonly known as the prickly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Astragalus hystrix is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
