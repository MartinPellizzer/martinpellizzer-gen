    "intro": "Astragalus amatus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus amatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
