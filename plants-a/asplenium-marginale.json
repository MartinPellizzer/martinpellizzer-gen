    "intro": "Asplenium marginale, commonly known as the marginal harts-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a pale margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique leaf morphology and adaptability make it a distinctive and resilient member of the fern family."
