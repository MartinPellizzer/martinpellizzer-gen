    "intro": "Astragalus pseudocyclophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus pseudocyclophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
