    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are borne on tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream sides. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
