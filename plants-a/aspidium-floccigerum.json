    "intro": "Aspidium floccigerum, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its soft, feathery fronds that give it a fluffy appearance, hence its common name. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including India, China, and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium floccigerum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
