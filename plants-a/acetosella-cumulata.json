It features small, rosette-like clusters of dark green, velvety leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",
