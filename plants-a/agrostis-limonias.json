    "intro": "Agrostis limonias, commonly known as lemongrass agrostis, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness. Agrostis limonias is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
