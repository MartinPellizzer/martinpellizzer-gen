    "intro": "Anthurium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the true flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium latifolium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
