    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha fimbriata var. robusta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This variant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen in secondary growth areas. It prefers well-drained soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fimbriata var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred during the 19th century when European settlers were establishing gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become a potential invasive species in some regions. It is now found growing in coastal and urban areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation."
