The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is commonly seen in dune environments and along the margins of estuaries. Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within South Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia natalensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
