    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 stoerkianum var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor aconite, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely foliated stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant produces distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
