It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a single, elongated raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are typically green and slightly hairy. Aconitum funiculare contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution in handling and cultivation.",
