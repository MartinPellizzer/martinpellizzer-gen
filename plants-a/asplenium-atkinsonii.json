    "intro": "Asplenium atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. This plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium atkinsonii is often found in montane regions and is adapted to thrive in cool, moist conditions."
