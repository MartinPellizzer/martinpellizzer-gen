    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. vulgaris, commonly known as the dwarf almond or sweet almond bush, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant bears small, round nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and container planting. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential as a source of edible nuts."
