    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. This variety is adapted to withstand extreme cold and has a short growing season."
