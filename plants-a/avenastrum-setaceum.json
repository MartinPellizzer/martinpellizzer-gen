    "intro": "Avenastrum setaceum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Avenastrum setaceum is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
