    "intro": "Angraecopsis hallei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It produces long, slender stems and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hair. Angraecopsis hallei is known for its unique pollination mechanism, relying on specific nocturnal moths for reproduction."
