    "intro": "Angraecum capitatum, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences with numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum capitatum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in its native habitat."
