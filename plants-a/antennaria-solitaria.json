It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with hairy stems, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing yellowish disc florets surrounded by pale pink to white ray florets. Antennaria solitaria thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
