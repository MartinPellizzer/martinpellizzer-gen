It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
