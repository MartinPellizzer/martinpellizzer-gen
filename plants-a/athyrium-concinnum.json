    "intro": "Athyrium concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium concinnum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
