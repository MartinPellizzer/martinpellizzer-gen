    "intro": "Agave aboriginum, commonly known as the Mexican century plant, is a perennial succulent native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth and ability to store water in its leaves make it an important plant in traditional and modern horticulture."
