    "intro": "Astragalus acinacifer, commonly known as the clubbed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Astragalus acinacifer plays a role in soil stabilization and is valued for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
