    "intro": "Acaena rubescens, commonly known as the red burclover, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and spiny, bristly fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. Its distinctive red-tinged fruits are a key feature, often containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Acaena rubescens plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for native birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena rubescens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in various habitats across the country, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with the native vegetation of the South Island. It is well adapted to the environmental conditions of New Zealand, including its soil types and climate patterns. Acaena rubescens plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena rubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for its ornamental value and as a potential forage crop. However, it has since become an invasive species in many parts of New Zealand. Its rapid spread has led to the displacement of native flora in certain regions."
