It features compact, branching stems covered in small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
