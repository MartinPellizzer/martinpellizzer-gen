It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bulbils along its stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its mild garlic scent and edible leaves."
