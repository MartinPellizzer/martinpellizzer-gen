    "intro": "Amphicarpaea pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the shores of lakes and rivers. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique botanical feature is the presence of two types of fruits: one that is above ground and one that is below ground, a trait known as amphicarpous. This adaptation allows the plant to efficiently reproduce in its often unpredictable aquatic environment."
