    "intro": "Acalypha gummifera, commonly known as the stickyleaf or gumtree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often sticky bark and heart-shaped leaves that are usually green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Acalypha gummifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha gummifera is primarily native to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and southeastern Mexico. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in lowland areas with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with disturbed habitats such as forest edges and cleared land. Its distribution is largely confined to the Neotropical region of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gummifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and forest edges. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
