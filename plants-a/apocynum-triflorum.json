It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds with silky hairs. Apocynum triflorum is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers."
