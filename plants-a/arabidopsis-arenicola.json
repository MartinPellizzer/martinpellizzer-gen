    "intro": "Arabidopsis arenicola, commonly known as the sand arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. This species is particularly adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. Its compact growth habit and rapid life cycle make it a model organism for studying plant responses to drought stress. The plant produces small white flowers and is often used in ecological and genetic research due to its genetic simplicity and short generation time."
