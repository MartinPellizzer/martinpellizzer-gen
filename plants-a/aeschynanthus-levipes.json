It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences that resemble lanterns, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus levipes is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and unique appearance."
