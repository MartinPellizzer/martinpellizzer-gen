    "intro": "Avena longifolia, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena longifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
