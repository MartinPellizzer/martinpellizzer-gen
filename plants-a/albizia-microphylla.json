    "intro": "Albizia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Albizia microphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
