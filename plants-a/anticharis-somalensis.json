It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
