    "intro": "Asplenium varians var. squamuligerum, commonly known as the squamuliferous spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often found on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and biodiversity."
