It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to wetland environments. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
