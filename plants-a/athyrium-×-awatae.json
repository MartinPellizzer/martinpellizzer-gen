    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 awatae, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that display a striking combination of deep green and silvery-white on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a lush, textural addition to shaded gardens. Due to its sterility, it does not produce spores and is propagated through division of its rhizomes."
