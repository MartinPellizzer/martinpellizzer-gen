It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
