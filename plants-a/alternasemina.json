    "intro": "Alternasemina, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. They are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are often hairy. Alternasemina species play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and aquatic organisms."
