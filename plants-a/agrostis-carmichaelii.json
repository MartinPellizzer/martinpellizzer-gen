    "intro": "Agrostis carmichaelii, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also a food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
