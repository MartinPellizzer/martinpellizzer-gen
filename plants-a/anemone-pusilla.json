    "intro": "Anemone pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and its stems are usually hairy. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Anemone pusilla is also known for its ability to naturalize and form dense colonies over time."
