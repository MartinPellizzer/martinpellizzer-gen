It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single spike of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The subspecies fragrans is distinguished by its more intense floral scent compared to other members of the species. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in meadows and grasslands across southern Europe. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
