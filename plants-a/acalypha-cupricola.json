    "intro": "Acalypha cupricola, commonly known as copperleaf, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Acalypha cupricola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly observed in lowland and montane forest areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within DR Congo.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cupricola was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in certain regions of the country. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plants in ecological systems."
