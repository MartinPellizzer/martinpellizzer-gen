    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. semiglabrum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its name derives from the sweet, honey-like scent emitted by its flowers, which attracts pollinators such as bees."
