    "intro": "Achyronia retroflexa, commonly known as the purple false nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Achyronia retroflexa is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges.",
