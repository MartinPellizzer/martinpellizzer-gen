    "intro": "Agalinis maritima var. maritima, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salinity and arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Agalinis maritima var. maritima is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a vital role in ecosystem resilience."
