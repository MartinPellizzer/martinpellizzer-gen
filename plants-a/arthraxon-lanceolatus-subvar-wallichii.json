It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and a fibrous root system. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
