    "intro": "Agrostis maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal meadows. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Agrostis maritima plays a role in stabilizing dune sands and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small animals."
