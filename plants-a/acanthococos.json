    "intro": "Acanthococos, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that are actually modified leaves or bracts. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Acanthococos species are often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. These plants are not only ornamental but also have historical uses in traditional medicine."
