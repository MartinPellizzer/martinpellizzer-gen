    "intro": "Alyssum wulfenianum var. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
