    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus grandiflorus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, northern Africa, and parts of western Asia. It thrives in coastal areas, rocky soils, and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and cliffs. This plant is commonly found in countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Its striking foliage and spires of flowers make it a notable ornamental plant in its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus grandiflorus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spire-like flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is often used as a focal point in mixed borders or as a specimen plant in formal gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed. Its introduction has led to both appreciation and concern in ecological contexts."
