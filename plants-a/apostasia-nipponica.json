    "intro": "Apostasia nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese spathephyllum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated spathe. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often fragrant. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
