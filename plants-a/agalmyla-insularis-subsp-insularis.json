    "intro": "Agalmyla insularis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island agalmyla, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island environments. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and often thrives in coastal or rocky habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
