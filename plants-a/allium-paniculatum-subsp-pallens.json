It features strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically narrow and gray-green in color. The plant produces dense, terminal inflorescences of small, white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves and mild garlic-like flavor, making it a popular choice in Asian cuisine. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
