    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum silvaccola var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
