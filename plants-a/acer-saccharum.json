    "intro": "Acer saccharum, commonly known as sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its sap, tapped in early spring, is a key ingredient in the production of maple syrup. The bark of the sugar maple is smooth when young but becomes furrowed and flaky with age.",
