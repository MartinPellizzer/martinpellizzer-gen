    "intro": "Astragalus ephemeretorum, commonly known as the ephemeral milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often going dormant during periods of extreme drought. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
