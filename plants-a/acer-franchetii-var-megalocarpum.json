    "intro": "Acer franchetii var. megalocarpum, commonly known as the giant-seeded maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color in summer. The tree produces showy, red-orange flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are larger than those of most other maple species. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.",
