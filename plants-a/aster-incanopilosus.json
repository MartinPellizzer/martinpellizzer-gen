    "intro": "Aster incanopilosus, commonly known as the white-haired aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are grayish-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Aster incanopilosus is often found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
