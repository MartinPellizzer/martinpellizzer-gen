It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in dense, conical inflorescences. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its stems are typically hairy and upright. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
