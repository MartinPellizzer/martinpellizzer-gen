    "intro": "Aegopordon fontqueri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
