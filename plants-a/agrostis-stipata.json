    "intro": "Agrostis stipata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Agrostis stipata is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
