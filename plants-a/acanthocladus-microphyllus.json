    "intro": "Acanthocladus microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthocladus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on fern evolution and ecological adaptation.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocladus microphyllus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly the tropical regions of countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocladus microphyllus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and a temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial shade. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
