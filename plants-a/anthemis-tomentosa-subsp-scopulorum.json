    "intro": "Anthemis tomentosa subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the rough anthemis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal cliffs, slopes, and dry grasslands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with poor to average soil conditions."
