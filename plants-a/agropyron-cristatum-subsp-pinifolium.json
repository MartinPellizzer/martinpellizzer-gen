    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. pinifolium, commonly known as the pineleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to rocky, dry, and high-altitude environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
