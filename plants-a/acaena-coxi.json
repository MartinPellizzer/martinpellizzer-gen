This plant grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes. Acaena coxi is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena coxi was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
