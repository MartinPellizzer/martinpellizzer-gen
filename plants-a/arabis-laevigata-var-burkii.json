    "intro": "Arabis laevigata var. burkii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to mountainous environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
