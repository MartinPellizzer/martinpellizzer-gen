    "intro": "Astragalus truncatoalatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus truncatoalatus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
