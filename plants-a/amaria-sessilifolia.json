    "intro": "Amaria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf amaria, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes bellflowers. This herbaceous perennial typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually white or pale blue, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk."
