    "intro": "Aristolochia manaosensis, commonly known as the Amazonian Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or brown in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, tubular corolla that resembles a pipe or a horn. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. The species is also notable for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic compounds used in traditional medicine but are also linked to kidney damage."
