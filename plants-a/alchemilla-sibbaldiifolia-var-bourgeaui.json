    "intro": "Alchemilla sibbaldiifolia var. bourgeaui, commonly known as the Bourgeau alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in gardens."
