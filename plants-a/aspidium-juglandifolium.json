    "intro": "Aspidium juglandifolium, commonly known as the walnut-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble the shape of a walnut leaf. The fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length, with a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves."
