    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. brachysiphon, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
