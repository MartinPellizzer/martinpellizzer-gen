    "intro": "Asplenium africanum, commonly known as the African spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium africanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
