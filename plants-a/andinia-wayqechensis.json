    "intro": "Andinia wayqechensis, commonly known as the Wayqech Valley orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a central rhizome. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
