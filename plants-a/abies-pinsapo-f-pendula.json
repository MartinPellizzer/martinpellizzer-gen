    "intro": "Abies pinsapo f. pendula, commonly known as the hanging cedar of Spain, is a rare and distinctive form of the Spanish cedar. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that drape downwards, creating a unique and elegant appearance. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain, particularly in the Sierra de Cazorla. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo f. pendula is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in southern Spain. This unique form of the Spanish fir is found in the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Los Filabres mountain ranges. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of these areas, making it a rare and endemic species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo f. pendula was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions, including temperate and subtropical regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires adequate sunlight for optimal growth. This introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its unique weeping form. It has been planted in botanical gardens and parks around the world. However, its natural range is limited, and it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native habitat."
