    "intro": "Arenaria iberica, commonly known as Iberian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss. Arenaria iberica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
