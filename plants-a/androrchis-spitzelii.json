    "intro": "Androrchis spitzelii, commonly known as the Spitzel's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in the late spring or early summer. The plant's botanical features include a fleshy, tuberous root system and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, hooded lip that is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Androrchis spitzelii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
