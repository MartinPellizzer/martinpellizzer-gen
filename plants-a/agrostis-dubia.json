    "intro": "Agrostis dubia, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Agrostis dubia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
