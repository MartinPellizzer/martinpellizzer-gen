    "intro": "Aceratium insulare, commonly known as the island sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aceratium insulare is considered a rare and endangered species.",
