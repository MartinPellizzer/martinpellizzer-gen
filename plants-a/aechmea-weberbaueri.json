    "intro": "Aechmea weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America, specifically Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup that collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, grass-like, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears bright red bracts and small white flowers, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
