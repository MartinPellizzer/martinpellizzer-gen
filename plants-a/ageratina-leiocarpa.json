    "intro": "Ageratina leiocarpa, commonly known as white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its fluffy, white inflorescences that resemble clouds, which are composed of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a velvety texture, while its stems are hairy and somewhat woody. Ageratina leiocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
