    "intro": "Allium azaurenum, commonly known as the purple garlic or blue garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or violet. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which is more pronounced when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Allium azaurenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its visual impact and fragrance."
