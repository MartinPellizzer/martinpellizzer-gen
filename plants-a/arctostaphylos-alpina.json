    "intro": "Arctostaphylos alpina, commonly known as the alpine manzanita, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, red berry that contains several seeds. Arctostaphylos alpina is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a hardy and resilient species."
