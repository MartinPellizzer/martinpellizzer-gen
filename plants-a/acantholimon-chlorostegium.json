    "intro": "Acantholimon chlorostegium, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers clustered in dense inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in arid and rocky habitats, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran where the environmental conditions are suitable.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon chlorostegium was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and moderate climates, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control. It is commonly found in regions such as California, Oregon, and parts of the Pacific Northwest in the United States. This plant has adapted well to disturbed sites and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated landscapes. However, it is considered a non-native species and may have limited ecological impact in its new environment."
