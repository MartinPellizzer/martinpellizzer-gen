    "intro": "Arenaria polytrichoides, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves that are covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Arenaria polytrichoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
