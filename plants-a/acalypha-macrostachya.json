    "intro": "Acalypha macrostachya, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are borne on long, branching inflorescences. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. Acalypha macrostachya is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth.",

    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya was mainly introduced to Trinidad and Tobago. It is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. The introduction of this species to Trinidad and Tobago is likely due to ornamental horticulture or accidental spread through human activity. It has adapted well to the local climate and has become naturalized in certain areas. However, its ecological impact remains under study."
