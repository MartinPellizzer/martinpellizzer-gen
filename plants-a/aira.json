    "intro": "Aira, commonly known as false rice, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of about 30 species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Many species are found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. Aira species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
