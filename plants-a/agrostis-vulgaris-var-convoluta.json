    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. convoluta, commonly known as curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
