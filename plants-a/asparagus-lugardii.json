    "intro": "Asparagus lugardii, commonly known as the Cape asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features slender, jointed stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense umbels, followed by edible, needle-like spears that are harvested in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Asparagus lugardii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
