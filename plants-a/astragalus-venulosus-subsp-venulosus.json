    "intro": "Astragalus venulosus subsp. venulosus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. The subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and distinctive, finely veined leaves."
