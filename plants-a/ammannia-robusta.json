    "intro": "Ammannia robusta, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive red stems, which become more prominent as the plant matures. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive weed in some regions."
