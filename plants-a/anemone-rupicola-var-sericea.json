It features basal leaves that are softly hairy and often covered in a fine, silken down, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive central tuft of stamens. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
