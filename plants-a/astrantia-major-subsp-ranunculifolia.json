    "intro": "Astrantia major subsp. ranunculifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf aster or white wood aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a coarse texture and a hairy surface. The plant produces showy, flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
