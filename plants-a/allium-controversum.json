    "intro": "Allium controversum, commonly known as the wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a cluster of small, white, star-shaped flowers. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Allium controversum is valued for its edible leaves and flowers, which have a mild garlic-like flavor."
