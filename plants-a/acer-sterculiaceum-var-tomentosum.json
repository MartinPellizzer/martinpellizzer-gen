    "intro": "Acer sterculiaceum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive greyish-brown bark and trifoliate leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in its native habitat.",
