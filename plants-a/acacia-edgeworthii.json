    "intro": "Acacia edgeworthii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are grouped in dense, globular clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that serve as the primary means of photosynthesis. Acacia edgeworthii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system for water absorption. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also a symbol of Australian national identity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia edgeworthii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. Acacia edgeworthii is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia edgeworthii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of Acacia species for ornamental and agricultural purposes. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive Acacia species."
