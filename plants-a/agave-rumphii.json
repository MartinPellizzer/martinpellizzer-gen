It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears white or pale yellow flowers, which are not typically used for ornamental purposes. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave rumphii is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes."
