It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Artemisia piperita has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiparasitic benefits."
