It is characterized by its distinctive wavy, undulating leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
