    "intro": "Anisomeris tristis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock, and serves as a defense mechanism. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it plays a role in supporting local ecosystems. Anisomeris tristis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
