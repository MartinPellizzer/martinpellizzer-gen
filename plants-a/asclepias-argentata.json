    "intro": "Asclepias argentata, commonly known as silverleaf milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Asclepias argentata is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
