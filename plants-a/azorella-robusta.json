    "intro": "Azorella robusta, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing mats or cushions, which help it retain heat and moisture in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Azorella robusta produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
