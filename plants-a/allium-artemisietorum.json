    "intro": "Allium artemisietorum, commonly known as the Armenian garlic or wild leek, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, cylindrical stem that bears a cluster of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its bulbous structure is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine, similar to other Allium species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
