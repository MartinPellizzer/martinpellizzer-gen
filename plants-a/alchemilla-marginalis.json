    "intro": "Alchemilla marginalis, commonly known as the marginal lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, soft green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks. Its common name derives from its historical use in alchemical practices and its ability to retain moisture, resembling a miniature mantle."
