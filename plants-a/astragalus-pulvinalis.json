    "intro": "Astragalus pulvinalis, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus pulvinalis is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
