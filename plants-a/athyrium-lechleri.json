    "intro": "Athyrium lechleri, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its elegant, delicate fronds that often display a golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forests with rich, moist soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Athyrium lechleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
