    "intro": "Agave houghii, commonly known as the Hough's agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave houghii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
