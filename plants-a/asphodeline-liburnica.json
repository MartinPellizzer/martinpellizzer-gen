    "intro": "Asphodeline liburnica, commonly known as the Liburnian asphodel, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb with tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slight blue-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Asphodeline liburnica is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
