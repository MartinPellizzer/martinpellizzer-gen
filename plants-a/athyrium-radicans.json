    "intro": "Athyrium radicans, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided with a distinctive, arching form. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
