    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia tomentosa is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is also native to parts of eastern Canada, such as Ontario and Quebec. Abelia tomentosa is well adapted to humid climates and is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive pink and white flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia tomentosa was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It was first brought to North America in the 19th century by European botanists and horticulturists. The plant has since been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the eastern and southern regions of the country. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts in natural habitats."
