It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a dark green coloration. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on the bases of trees. As a hybrid, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
