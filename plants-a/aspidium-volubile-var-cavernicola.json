    "intro": "Aspidium volubile var. cavernicola, commonly known as the cave fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in caves or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, frond-like leaves that are usually curled or coiled when young. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground or rock surfaces. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique adaptation to subterranean habitats."
