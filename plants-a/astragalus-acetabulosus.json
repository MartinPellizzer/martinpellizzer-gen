    "intro": "Astragalus acetabulosus, commonly known as the cupped milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus acetabulosus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological importance in supporting native pollinators."
