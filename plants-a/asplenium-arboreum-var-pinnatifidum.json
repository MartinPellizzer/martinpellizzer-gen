    "intro": "Asplenium arboreum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
