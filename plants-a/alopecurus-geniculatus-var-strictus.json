    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, hairy seeds. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
