    "intro": "Asplenium blepharodes, commonly known as the earthen fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, and is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium blepharodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
