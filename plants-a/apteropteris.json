    "intro": "Apteropteris, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often resemble fan shapes, giving them their common name. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Apteropteris species are known for their rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to their intricate appearance."
