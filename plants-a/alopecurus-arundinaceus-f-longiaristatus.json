    "intro": "Alopecurus arundinaceus f. longiaristatus, commonly known as the long-awned false oat, is a grass species characterized by its elongated awns and slender, cylindrical stems. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands, preferring temperate climates. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
