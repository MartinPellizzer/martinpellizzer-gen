    "intro": "Arenaria macrantha, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria macrantha thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
