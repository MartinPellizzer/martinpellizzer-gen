    "intro": "Andromeda recurva, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are usually less than an inch in length. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Andromeda recurva thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, native plant."
