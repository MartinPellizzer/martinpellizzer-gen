    "intro": "Aconitum quelpaertense, commonly known as the Jeju aconite, is a perennial herb native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant produces large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle. Aconitum quelpaertense is often found in moist, rocky soils in mountainous regions.",
