    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia diantreeana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This species is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in dry conditions. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and water-storing capabilities. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia diantreeana was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas of Australia, particularly in the northern and central regions. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and habitat for local wildlife. Its introduction has been largely for ecological restoration and land stabilization purposes. However, it can sometimes become invasive if not managed properly."
