    "intro": "Alsinastrum callitrichoides, commonly known as wireweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Alsinastrum callitrichoides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas."
