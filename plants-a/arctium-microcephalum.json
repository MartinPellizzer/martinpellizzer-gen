    "intro": "Arctium microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hollow and often have a purple tinge. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
