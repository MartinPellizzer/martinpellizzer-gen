    "intro": "Adenandra ovata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. These flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Adenandra ovata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.",
