    "intro": "Atherolepis pierrei var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed Atherolepis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native plant species."
