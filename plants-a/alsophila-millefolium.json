    "intro": "Alsophila millefolium, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Alsophila millefolium plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
