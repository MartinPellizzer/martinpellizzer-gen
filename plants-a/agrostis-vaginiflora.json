    "intro": "Agrostis vaginiflora, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Agrostis vaginiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
