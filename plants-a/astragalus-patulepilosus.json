    "intro": "Astragalus patulepilosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration ecology. Astragalus patulepilosus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
