    "intro": "Abdominea micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale in color. Due to its specialized adaptations for capturing prey, it plays a unique role in its aquatic ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abdominea micrantha is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, often growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth. This plant is commonly found in primary and secondary tropical rainforests, where it forms part of the understory vegetation. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot. Due to habitat destruction, its native range has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abdominea micrantha was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and horticultural practices. It has been reported in regions with warm and humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in establishing itself in new areas. However, further study is needed to assess its ecological impact on local flora and fauna."
