It is characterized by its oval to elliptic leaves with smooth margins, distinguishing it from other varieties of Amelanchier. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries in the summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
