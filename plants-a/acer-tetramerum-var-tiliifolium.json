    "intro": "Acer tetramerum var. tiliifolium, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. The Oregon maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
