    "intro": "Asplenium nitidulum, commonly known as the shining spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its fronds typically remain compact, with a delicate, fern-like structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves."
