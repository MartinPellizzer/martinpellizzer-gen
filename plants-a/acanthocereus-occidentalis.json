It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This cactus thrives in desert and semi-desert environments, often growing on rocky soils. It is commonly associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and is often seen in rocky canyons and along dry streambeds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus occidentalis was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This cactus is known for its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming flowers. It has been introduced to various regions as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
