    "intro": "Astragalus succulentus var. paysonii, commonly known as Payson's milkvetch, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, spiny leaves and produces delicate, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
