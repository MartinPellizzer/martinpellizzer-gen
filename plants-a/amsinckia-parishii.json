It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Amsinckia parishii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
