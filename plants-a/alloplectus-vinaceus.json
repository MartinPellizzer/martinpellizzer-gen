    "intro": "Alloplectus vinaceus, commonly known as the red-stemmed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its stems are covered in fine, reddish hairs, and its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
