    "intro": "Atriplex vallicola, commonly known as mountain saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry slopes, valleys, and sagebrush steppe habitats. Atriplex vallicola plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
