    "intro": "Athyrium medium, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a striking silver-white underside that contrasts beautifully with its dark green upper surface. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers partial to full shade in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming a lush, carpet-like ground cover. Athyrium medium is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shady garden landscapes."
