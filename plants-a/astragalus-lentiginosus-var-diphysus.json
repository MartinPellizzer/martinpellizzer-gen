    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. diphysus, commonly known as the spotted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
