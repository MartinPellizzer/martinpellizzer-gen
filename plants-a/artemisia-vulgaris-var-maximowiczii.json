    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. maximowiczii, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, clustered in branched clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its strong, distinctive scent is due to volatile compounds like thujone and camphor."
