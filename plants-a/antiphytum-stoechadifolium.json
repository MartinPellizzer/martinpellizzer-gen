    "intro": "Antiphytum stoechadifolium, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its adaptability to harsh, rocky environments makes it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
