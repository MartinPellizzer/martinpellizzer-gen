    "intro": "Asarina erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered asarina, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, red-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Asarina erubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
