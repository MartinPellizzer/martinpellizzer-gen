    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens var. colorata, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by overlapping, bract-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
