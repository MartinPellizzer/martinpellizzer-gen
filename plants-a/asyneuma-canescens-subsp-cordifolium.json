    "intro": "Asyneuma canescens subsp. cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved asyneuma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a robust, upright stem with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
