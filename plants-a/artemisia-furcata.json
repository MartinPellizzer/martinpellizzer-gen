It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and branched, often glandular, stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia furcata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It contains essential oils and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
