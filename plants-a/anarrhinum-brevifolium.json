    "intro": "Anarrhinum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Anarrhinum brevifolium plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
