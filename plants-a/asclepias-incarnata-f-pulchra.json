    "intro": "Asclepias incarnata f. pulchra, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It is a valuable host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its botanical structure includes a milky sap, typical of the Asclepias genus, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
