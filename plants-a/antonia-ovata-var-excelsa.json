    "intro": "Antonia ovata var. excelsa, commonly known as the giant antonia, is a striking plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its dramatic appearance. It is a slow-growing plant that requires partial to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
