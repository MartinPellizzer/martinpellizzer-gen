    "intro": "Acantholimon karamanicum, commonly known as the Karaman's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon karamanicum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the eastern and southeastern areas. This plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments. It is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon karamanicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown limited naturalization and is not considered invasive in most areas. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its introduction has primarily been through horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal."
