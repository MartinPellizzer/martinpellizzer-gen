    "intro": "Aspidium riedleanum, commonly known as the Riedel's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium riedleanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
