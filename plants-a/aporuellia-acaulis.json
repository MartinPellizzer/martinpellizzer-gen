    "intro": "Aporuellia acaulis, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its erect, stemless growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Aporuellia acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
