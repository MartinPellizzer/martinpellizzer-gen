    "intro": "Asplenium samarkandense, commonly known as the Samarkand spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, with a distinct midrib. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
