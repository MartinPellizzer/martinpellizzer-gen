    "intro": "Allium margaritaceum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbiferous leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to form bulbs, which are edible and resemble those of the leek. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and culinary potential."
