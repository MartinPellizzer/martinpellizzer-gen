It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of grasses, and its flowers are usually wind-pollinated. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Anthoxanthum carrenianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions."
