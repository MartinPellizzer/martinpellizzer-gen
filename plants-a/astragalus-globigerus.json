    "intro": "Astragalus globigerus, commonly known as the globe milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its globular, spiny seed pods and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in late spring or early summer. Astragalus globigerus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
