    "intro": "Aspidium sophoroides, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium sophoroides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
