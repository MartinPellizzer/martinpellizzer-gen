    "intro": "Alagophylla, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alagophylla has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, enhancing its survival in dry conditions. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their purported healing properties."
