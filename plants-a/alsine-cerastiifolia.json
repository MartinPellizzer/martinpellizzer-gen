    "intro": "Alsine cerastiifolia, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is well-suited to its open, dry habitat."
