    "intro": "Astragalus weixinensis, commonly known as the Weixin milkvetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to pink. Native to China, this species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus weixinensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
