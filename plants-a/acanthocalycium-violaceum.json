It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This species typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and creosote bush habitats. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium violaceum was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often cultivated in rock gardens and succulent collections due to its compact growth habit and attractive violet flowers. It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora. Proper management is essential to prevent its spread in natural habitats."
