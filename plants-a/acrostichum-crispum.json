    "intro": "Acrostichum crispum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often curled or crisped at the edges. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along coastlines and in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.",
