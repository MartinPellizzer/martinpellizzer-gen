    "intro": "Arachniodes webbiana, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Arachniodes webbiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique foliage."
