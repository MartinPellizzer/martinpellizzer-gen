    "intro": "Aruba orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco aruba, is a rare plant species native to the Orinoco River basin in South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
