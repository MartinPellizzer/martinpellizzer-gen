    "intro": "Archangelica officinalis subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or clay soils along sea shores and estuaries. Due to its habitat, it is often found in areas with high salinity and strong winds."
