It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal despite its pungent scent.",
