    "intro": "Asperella duthiei subsp. longe-aristata, commonly known as the long-awned asperella, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like morphology. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is distinguished by its elongated, bristly awns that extend from the lemma, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its unique features and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
