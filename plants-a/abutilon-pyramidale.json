This plant thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in dry forests and shrublands. Its natural habitat includes parts of the northern and central regions of Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pyramidale was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions. Despite its ornamental value, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success as an introduced species. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
