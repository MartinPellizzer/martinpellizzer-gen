    "intro": "Artemisia lavandulifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a strong mint-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Artemisia lavandulifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and useful in traditional herbal practices."
