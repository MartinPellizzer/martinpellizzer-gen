    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
