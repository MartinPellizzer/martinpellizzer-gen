    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pungens subsp. elegans, commonly known as the slender manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or coastal environments."
