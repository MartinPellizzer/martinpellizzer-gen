    "intro": "Arctium bungeanum, commonly known as the Bunge hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its tall stature and showy flowers, it is both ecologically significant and occasionally considered a weed."
