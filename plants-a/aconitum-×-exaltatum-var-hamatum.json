    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 exaltatum var. hamatum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It features striking, spurred blue or purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which are characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and scientific interest.",
