    "intro": "Actinocephalus heteropus, commonly known as the spiral flax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are typically clustered in a head-like structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive spiral pattern that aids in light absorption. The spiral flax is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.",
