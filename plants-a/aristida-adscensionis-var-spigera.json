    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. spigera, commonly known as the spiky grass or spigera lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, tufted culms with tightly packed, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
