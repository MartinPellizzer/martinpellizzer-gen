    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in saline and arid environments, making it a common species in coastal and semi-arid areas. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
