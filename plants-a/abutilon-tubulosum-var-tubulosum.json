    "intro": "Abutilon tubulosum var. tubulosum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tubulosum var. tubulosum is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of these states. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops, sand dunes, and open woodlands. The species is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of the region. Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in the Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tubulosum var. tubulosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was brought there during the 19th century by European settlers and gardeners who admired its unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in many areas, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Despite its ornamental value, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems."
