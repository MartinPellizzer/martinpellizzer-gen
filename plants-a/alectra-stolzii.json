    "intro": "Alectra stolzii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its small, palmate leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Alectra stolzii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, desert climates."
