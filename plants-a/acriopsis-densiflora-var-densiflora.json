    "intro": "Acriopsis densiflora var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered acris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to wildflower gardens.",
