    "intro": "Arundastrum, commonly known as the common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It has long, narrow leaves and produces feathery, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. Arundastrum is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other moist habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
