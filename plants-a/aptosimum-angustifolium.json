    "intro": "Aptosimum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leafed tansy, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
