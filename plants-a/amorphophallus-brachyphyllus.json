It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, thick, tuberous roots that resemble an elephant's foot, which store nutrients and water. Its leaves are typically large and arrow-shaped, and it produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a spathe. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
