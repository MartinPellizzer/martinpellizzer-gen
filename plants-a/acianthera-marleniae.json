    "intro": "Acianthera marleniae, commonly known as the Marlenia's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acianthera marleniae is considered a conservation concern.",
