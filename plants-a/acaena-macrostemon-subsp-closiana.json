    "intro": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. closiana, commonly known as the New Zealand burr plant, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright yellow flowers followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. closiana is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland environments where the climate is temperate and the soil is well-drained. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. closiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This subspecies is now considered a weed in certain regions of New Zealand due to its invasive tendencies. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can colonize disturbed areas quickly. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to outcompete native plant species."
