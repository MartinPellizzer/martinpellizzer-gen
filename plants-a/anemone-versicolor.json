    "intro": "Anemone versicolor, commonly known as the variable anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features showy, radially symmetrical flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or marshy areas, often forming clumps with fleshy, hairy stems. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
