    "intro": "Aldama cornifolia, commonly known as the horned Aldama, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiny calyces that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Aldama cornifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
