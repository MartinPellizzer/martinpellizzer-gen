    "intro": "Asplenium sessilifolium f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common shield fern. It is a small, evergreen fern with compact, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The fronds are typically short and clustered, forming a dense, low-growing mat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or shaded soil in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
