    "intro": "Archibaccharis serratifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
