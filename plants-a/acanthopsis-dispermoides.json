It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats. The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is commonly seen in fynbos vegetation types.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis dispermoides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among local conservationists and land managers."
