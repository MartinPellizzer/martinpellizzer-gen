    "intro": "Acacia hastulata, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seed pods are elongated and contain small, hard seeds. Acacia hastulata is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hastulata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal and sandy regions of the state. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, open habitats. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its distribution is largely confined to the southwestern and southern parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hastulata was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered an environmental weed in several regions of southern Australia. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but is particularly common in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural land. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a significant threat to native vegetation. Despite its invasive nature, it remains popular in horticulture for its aesthetic value."
