    "intro": "Alyssum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow or white flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Alyssum maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
