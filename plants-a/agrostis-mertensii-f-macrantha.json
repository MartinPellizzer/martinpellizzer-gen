    "intro": "Agrostis mertensii f. macrantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved bentgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often more prominent and elongated compared to the typical form of Agrostis mertensii. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. This form is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers, making it a notable variant in botanical studies."
