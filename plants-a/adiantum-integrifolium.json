    "intro": "Adiantum integrifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum integrifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shady garden settings or as a houseplant.",
