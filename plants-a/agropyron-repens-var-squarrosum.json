    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
