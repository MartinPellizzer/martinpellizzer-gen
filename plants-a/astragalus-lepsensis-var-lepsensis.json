    "intro": "Astragalus lepsensis var. lepsensis, commonly known as the Lepsen's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
