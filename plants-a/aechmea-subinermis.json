    "intro": "Aechmea subinermis, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a silvery-white powdery coating. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and regular misting to maintain humidity."
