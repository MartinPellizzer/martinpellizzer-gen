    "intro": "Azorella compressa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of South America. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it survive in cold, arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, reducing water loss and providing insulation. It produces yellow to orange flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Azorella compressa is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
