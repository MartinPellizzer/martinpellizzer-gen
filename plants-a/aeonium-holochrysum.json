    "intro": "Aeonium holochrysum, commonly known as the \"Golden Aeonium,\" is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with striking golden or yellow markings. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in arid landscapes."
