    "intro": "Agrostophyllum graminifolium subsp. rotundilabium, commonly known as the round-leafed grass-leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its botanical structure reflects its classification within the grass family, with a fibrous root system and a basal leaf arrangement."
