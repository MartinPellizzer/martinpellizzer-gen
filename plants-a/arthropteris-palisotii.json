    "intro": "Arthropteris palisotii, commonly known as the Palisot's water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Arthropteris palisotii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid indoor settings."
