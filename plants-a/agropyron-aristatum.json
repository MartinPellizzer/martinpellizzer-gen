    "intro": "Agropyron aristatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, tufted clusters of spikelets at the tips. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. Agropyron aristatum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
