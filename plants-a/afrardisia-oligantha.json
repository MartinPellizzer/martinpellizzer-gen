    "intro": "Afrardisia oligantha, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, woolly leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Afrardisia oligantha is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
