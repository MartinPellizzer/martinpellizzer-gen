It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
