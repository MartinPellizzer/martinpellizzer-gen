    "intro": "Acetosa aculeata, commonly known as the prickly sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, triangular leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Acetosa aculeata is noted for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
