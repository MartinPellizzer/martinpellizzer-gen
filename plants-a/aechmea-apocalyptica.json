    "intro": "Aechmea apocalyptica, commonly known as the \"Apocalyptic Bromeliad,\" is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and orange. The plant produces a tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears striking violet or pink flowers, which bloom in a dramatic display. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help collect and store water in the central rosette. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
