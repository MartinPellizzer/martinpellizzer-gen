    "intro": "Artemisia somae var. batakensis, commonly known as Batak wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. This variant is closely related to other Artemisia species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution."
