    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea subsp. eucinerea, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration in harsh environments. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils."
