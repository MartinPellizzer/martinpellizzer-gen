    "intro": "Astragalus mollis, commonly known as silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus mollis is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
