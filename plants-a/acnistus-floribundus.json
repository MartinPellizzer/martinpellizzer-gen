    "intro": "Acnistus floribundus, commonly known as the flameleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats.",
