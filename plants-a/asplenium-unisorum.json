    "intro": "Asplenium unisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium unisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
