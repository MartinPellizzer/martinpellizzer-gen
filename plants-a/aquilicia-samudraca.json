    "intro": "Aquilicia samudraca, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom throughout the year. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines. Aquilicia samudraca is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
