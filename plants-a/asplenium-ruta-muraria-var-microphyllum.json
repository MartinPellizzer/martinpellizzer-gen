    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf rock spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a serrated margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in crevices. This variant is notable for its smaller foliage compared to the typical form of A. ruta-muraria."
