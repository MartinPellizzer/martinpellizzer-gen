    "intro": "Aethionema acarii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. Aethionema acarii is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and a succulent stem that helps it retain moisture. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
