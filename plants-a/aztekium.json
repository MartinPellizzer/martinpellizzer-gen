    "intro": "Aztekium, commonly known as the desert rose or Aztec cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and spiny, segmented stems. The plant typically produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Aztekium species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. Due to their slow growth and unique appearance, they are popular among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
