    "intro": "Acer polymorphum sanguineum, commonly known as the blood-red maple, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage, which becomes particularly showy in the autumn months. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a smooth, glossy surface. The flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a samara with a winged structure that aids in wind dispersal.",
