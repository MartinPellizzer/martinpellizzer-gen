    "intro": "Asplenium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium peruvianum is native to South America, particularly Peru, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
