    "intro": "Armeria alpina subsp. bubanii, commonly known as the Alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
