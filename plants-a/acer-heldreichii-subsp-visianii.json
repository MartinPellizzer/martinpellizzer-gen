It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers cooler, moist environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
