    "intro": "Acacia rostellifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia rostellifera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open habitats such as dunes and coastal heathlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. The plant is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rostellifera was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and erosion control. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments. It is also valued for its timber and as a source of animal forage."
