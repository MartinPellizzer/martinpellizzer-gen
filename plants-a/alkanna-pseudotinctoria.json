It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright orange to red bracts that resemble a paintbrush. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in arid environments. Alkanna pseudotinctoria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
