    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. cuneata, commonly known as the sticky alder or black alder, is a variant of the black alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often sticky to the touch, a feature that distinguishes it from other alder species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The botanical features of this plant make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
