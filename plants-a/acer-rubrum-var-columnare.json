It features elongated, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and compact form.",
