    "intro": "Arenaria cherleria, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged environment. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria cherleria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, rocky terrains."
