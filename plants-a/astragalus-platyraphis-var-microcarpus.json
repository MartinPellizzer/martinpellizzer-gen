    "intro": "Astragalus platyraphis var. microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered with soft, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by pea-like pods containing small, rounded seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it resilient in harsh environments. It is often found in steppe and desert habitats, contributing to local biodiversity and soil stabilization."
