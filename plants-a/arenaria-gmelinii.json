    "intro": "Arenaria gmelinii, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. It is often found in dunes, coastal plains, and rocky areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a hardy choice for gardeners in challenging environments."
