    "intro": "Arundinella pilosa, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and hairy foliage, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color. Arundinella pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizing plant in aquatic environments."
