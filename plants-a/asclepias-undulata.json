    "intro": "Asclepias undulata, commonly known as the wavy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, wavy-edged leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias undulata is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the survival of certain butterfly species."
