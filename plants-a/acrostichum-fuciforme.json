    "intro": "Acrostichum fuciforme, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. Its distinctive appearance resembles the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild.",
