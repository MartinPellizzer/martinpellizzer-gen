    "intro": "Anabasis zoharyi, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Anabasis zoharyi is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
