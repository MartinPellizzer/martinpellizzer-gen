    "intro": "Aechmea spectabilis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity. Aechmea spectabilis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
