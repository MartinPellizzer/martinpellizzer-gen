It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in dry slopes. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. It is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthogilia gloriosa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking yellow flowers and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
