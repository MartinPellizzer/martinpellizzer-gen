It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dimorphic, with a distinct difference between the upper and lower surfaces. The tree produces a unique fruit with a fibrous, inedible outer husk enclosing a sweet, starchy pulp. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional cuisines and for its ornamental value."
