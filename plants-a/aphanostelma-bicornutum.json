    "intro": "Aphanostelma bicornutum, commonly known as the two-horned sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying arid-region flora."
