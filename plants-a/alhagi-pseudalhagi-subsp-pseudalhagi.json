    "intro": "Alhagi pseudalhagi subsp. pseudalhagi, commonly known as the desert shrub or sand verbena, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
