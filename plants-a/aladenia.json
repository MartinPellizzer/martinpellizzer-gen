    "intro": "Aladenia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. Aladenia species typically have woody stems and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange. They are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine despite their potential hazards."
