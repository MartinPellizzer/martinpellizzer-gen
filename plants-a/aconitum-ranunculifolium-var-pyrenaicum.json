    "intro": "Aconitum ranunculifolium var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Pyrenees region. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
