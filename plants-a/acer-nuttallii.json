    "intro": "Acer nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red foliage that turns vibrant in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its leaves are typically palmate with five to seven lobes, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young. Acer nuttallii prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.",
