    "intro": "Aster sphaerotus, commonly known as the globe aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets arranged in a compact cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are upright and often branched. Aster sphaerotus blooms in late summer to early fall, producing showy purple to pink flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
