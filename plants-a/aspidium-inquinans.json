    "intro": "Aspidium inquinans, commonly known as the smoky water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green fronds that often appear smoky or dusty due to the presence of fine, powdery spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium inquinans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
