    "intro": "Acacia terminalis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and sandy plains. Acacia terminalis plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and birds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia terminalis is primarily native to New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in various habitats across these regions, including dry sclerophyll forests and grasslands. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland regions. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important component of local ecosystems. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to the diverse climates and landscapes of southeastern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia terminalis was mainly introduced to the Cape Provinces, India, and Northern Provinces. It was likely brought in for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for the climates of these regions. Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of these areas, though it requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalances. This distribution highlights its adaptability and utility in different geographical contexts."
