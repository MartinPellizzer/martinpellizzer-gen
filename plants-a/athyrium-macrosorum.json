    "intro": "Athyrium macrosorum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile spore-bearing fronds emerging from the base. Its lush, green foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Athyrium macrosorum thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil for optimal growth."
