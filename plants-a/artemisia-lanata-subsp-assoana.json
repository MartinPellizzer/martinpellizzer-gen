    "intro": "Artemisia lanata subsp. assoana, commonly known as the woolly sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, sometimes pungent scent. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
