    "intro": "Androsace acuta, commonly known as the acute androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather conditions. Androsace acuta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, well-drained soils."
