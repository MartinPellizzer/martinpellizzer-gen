    "intro": "Acer majus var. glaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscape planting.",
