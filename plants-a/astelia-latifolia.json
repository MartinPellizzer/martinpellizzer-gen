    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteila latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf astelia, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Astelia latifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form clumps over time, creating a lush, textured appearance."
