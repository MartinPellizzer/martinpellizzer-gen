It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of feathery, plume-like panicles in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are alternate and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and graceful appearance during the summer months."
