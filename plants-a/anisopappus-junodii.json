It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
