    "intro": "Arenaria verticillata, commonly known as sand pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in harsh environments such as tundra and mountain slopes. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Arenaria verticillata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and limited nutrients."
