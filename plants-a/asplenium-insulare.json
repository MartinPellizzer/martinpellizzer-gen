    "intro": "Asplenium insulare, commonly known as the island maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant's spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds."
