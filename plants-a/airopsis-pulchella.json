    "intro": "Airopsis pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful sea whip, is a marine colonial organism belonging to the class Anthozoa. It forms dense, branching structures composed of many polyps that are typically encrusted with symbiotic algae. The plant exhibits a flexible, whip-like appearance, which allows it to sway with ocean currents. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reef environments. Its botanical structure is characterized by a central axial canal surrounded by a network of zooids."
