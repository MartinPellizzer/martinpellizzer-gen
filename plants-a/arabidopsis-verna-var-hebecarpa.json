    "intro": "Arabidopsis verna var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the spring cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent silique, which is characteristic of the mustard family. It is often used as a model organism in plant genetics research due to its short life cycle and ease of cultivation."
