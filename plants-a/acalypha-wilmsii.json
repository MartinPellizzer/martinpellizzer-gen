    "intro": "Acalypha wilmsii, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Acalypha wilmsii is relatively easy to grow and can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds.",

This plant is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forested areas or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of these regions. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wilmsii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
