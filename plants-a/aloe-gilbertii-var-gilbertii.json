    "intro": "Aloe gilbertii var. gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, blooming in the spring. Its leaves can be used to extract gel, which has traditional medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
