    "intro": "Arenaria mixta, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Arenaria mixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
