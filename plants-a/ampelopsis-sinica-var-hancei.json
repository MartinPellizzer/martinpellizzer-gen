    "intro": "Ampelopsis sinica var. hancei, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
