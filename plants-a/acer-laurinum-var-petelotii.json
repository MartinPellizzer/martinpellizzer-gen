    "intro": "Acer laurinum var. petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the maple tree native to China. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often sought after by botanical enthusiasts and horticulturists.",
