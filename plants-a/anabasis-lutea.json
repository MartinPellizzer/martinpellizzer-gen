    "intro": "Anabasis lutea, commonly known as the yellow desertweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in sandy soils, and it often grows in open habitats such as dunes and plains. Anabasis lutea is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
