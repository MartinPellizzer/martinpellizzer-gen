    "intro": "Anagallidium, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plants are herbaceous, with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. Anagallidium species are characterized by their ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making them resilient to drought and poor soil quality. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in their native ranges."
