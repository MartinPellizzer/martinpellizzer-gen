    "intro": "Agastache barberi, commonly known as the Sierra penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Agastache barberi is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
