    "intro": "Achyrophorus trichocephalus, commonly known as the hairy-headed achyrophorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Achyrophorus trichocephalus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.",
