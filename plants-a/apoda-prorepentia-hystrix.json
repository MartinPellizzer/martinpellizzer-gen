    "intro": "Apoda-prorepentia hystrix, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky foliage. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to humid, shaded environments in Southeast Asia. The plant features long, narrow fronds with serrated edges and prominent, spiny protrusions along the leaf margins. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soil. The spiny structure serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
