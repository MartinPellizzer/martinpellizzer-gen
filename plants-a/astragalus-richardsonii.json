    "intro": "Astragalus richardsonii, commonly known as Richardson's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus richardsonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
