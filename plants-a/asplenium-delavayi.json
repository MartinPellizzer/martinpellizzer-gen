    "intro": "Asplenium delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium delavayi is often found in high-altitude habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
