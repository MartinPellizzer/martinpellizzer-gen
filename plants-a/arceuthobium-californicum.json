    "intro": "Arceuthobium californicum, commonly known as the California dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees over time, affecting forest ecosystems."
