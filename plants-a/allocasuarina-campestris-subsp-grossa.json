    "intro": "Allocasuarina campestris subsp. grossa, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
