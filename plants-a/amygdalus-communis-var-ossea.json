    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. ossea, commonly known as the osseous almond, is a rare and unique variant of the almond tree. It is characterized by its distinctive woody, bone-like texture in its bark and fruit hulls, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, hard-shelled fruits. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists."
