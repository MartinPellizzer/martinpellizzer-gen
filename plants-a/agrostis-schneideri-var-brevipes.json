    "intro": "Agrostis schneideri var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-gray hue, and its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in horticultural settings for erosion control or ornamental purposes."
