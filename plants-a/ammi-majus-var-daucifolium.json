    "intro": "Ammi majus var. daucifolium, commonly known as the greater bishop's weed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a fluffy, white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
