    "intro": "Asplenium cicutarium var. confusum, commonly known as the confused water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, creeping growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its morphological similarities to other Asplenium species, which can make identification challenging."
