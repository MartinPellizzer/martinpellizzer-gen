    "intro": "Asplenium sphenolobium var. diplaziosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a fern native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette. The plant thrives in rocky, moist environments, often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid gardens."
