    "intro": "Arctostaphylos mendocinoensis, commonly known as Mendocino manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of northern California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, moist climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
