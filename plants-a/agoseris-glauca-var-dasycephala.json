    "intro": "Agoseris glauca var. dasycephala, commonly known as the bluehead larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and branched. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and the plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats. It is toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids, making it an important plant to avoid in grazing areas."
