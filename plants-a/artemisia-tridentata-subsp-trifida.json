    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. trifida, commonly known as western wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes."
