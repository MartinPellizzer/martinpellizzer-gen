It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This species is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
