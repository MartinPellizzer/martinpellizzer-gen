    "intro": "Allophylus fulvinervis, commonly known as the yellow-veined alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and along stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with prominent yellow veins, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Allophylus fulvinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its foliage."
