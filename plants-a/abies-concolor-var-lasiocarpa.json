    "intro": "Abies concolor var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical white fir. The cones are typically reddish-brown and persist on the branches for several years, adding to the plant's ornamental value. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in montane and subalpine forests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to cold, moist conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor var. lasiocarpa is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Nevada. It is commonly found in high elevation areas, such as mountain ranges and forested regions. This variety is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor var. lasiocarpa was mainly introduced to specific regions in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, as a ornamental and forestry species. It was introduced primarily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for its aesthetic value and potential for timber production. This variety is known for its distinctive blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and competition with local plant species. Despite its ornamental appeal, its spread has been limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
