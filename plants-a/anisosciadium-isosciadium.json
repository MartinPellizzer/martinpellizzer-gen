It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its fruit is a hairy pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is noted for its variability in leaf and flower morphology, which contributes to its common name."
