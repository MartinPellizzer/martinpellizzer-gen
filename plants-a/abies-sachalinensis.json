    "intro": "Abies sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 cm long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological adaptability.",

It typically grows in mountainous and coastal regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the cold climate and is commonly found in forested areas. It is a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Sakhalin Island. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. This plant is typically found in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts. Its introduction into the dataset highlights the importance of documenting and preserving rare flora."
