    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. pratensis, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine and are also popular in garden settings for their ornamental value."
