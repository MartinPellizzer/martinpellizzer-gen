It features a rosette of fleshy, spirally arranged leaves that are typically gray-green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
