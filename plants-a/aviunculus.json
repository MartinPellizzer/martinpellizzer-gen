    "intro": "Aviunculus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. Aviunculus has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread readily in suitable habitats. It is sometimes considered a weed in gardens due to its aggressive growth habit."
