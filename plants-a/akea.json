    "intro": "Akea, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant typically grows along coastal areas and thrives in sandy soils with ample sunlight. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Akea plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is also valued for its ornamental beauty."
