    "intro": "Agropyron richardsonii var. ciliatum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant."
