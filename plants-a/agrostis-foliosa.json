    "intro": "Agrostis foliosa, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis foliosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
