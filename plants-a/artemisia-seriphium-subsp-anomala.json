It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Artemisia genus, sharing similar structural and chemical features."
