    "intro": "Asclepias bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds, and it serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Bicknell's milkweed thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it is often found in association with other native flora. Its ecological importance is significant, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
