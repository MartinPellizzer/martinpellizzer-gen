    "intro": "Androsace henryi var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. This plant is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in high-altitude meadows."
