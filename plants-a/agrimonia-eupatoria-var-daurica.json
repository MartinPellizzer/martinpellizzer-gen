    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. daurica, commonly known as Daurian agrimony, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated edges, often with a slightly hairy surface. This variant is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of tannins."
