    "intro": "Agropyron latiglume var. alboviride, commonly known as the green-veined wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive greenish-white coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a ornamental plant."
