    "intro": "Aster salicinus, commonly known as the willowleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, willow-like texture, giving it its common name. The flowers bloom in the fall, producing clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
