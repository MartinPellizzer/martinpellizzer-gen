It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and slender, often branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its resilience and medicinal properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
