    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. praepropera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, straight pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally considered toxic to livestock."
