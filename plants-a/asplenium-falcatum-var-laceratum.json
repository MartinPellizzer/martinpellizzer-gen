    "intro": "Asplenium falcatum var. laceratum, commonly known as the lacerate spleenwort, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, lacerated or torn appearance along the edges, giving it its common name."
