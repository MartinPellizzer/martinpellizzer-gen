    "intro": "Alchemilla opaca, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Alchemilla opaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
