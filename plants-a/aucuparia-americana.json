    "intro": "Aucuparia americana, commonly known as the American white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaras with two papery wings. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The American white ash is valued for its strong, straight-grained wood, which has been used historically for furniture and sports equipment."
