    "intro": "Abrophaes, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin, membranous sheath, which helps in water retention. Abrophaes is known for its slow growth and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
