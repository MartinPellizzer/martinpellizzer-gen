    "intro": "Anticharis glandulosa var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue-leafed anticharis, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments."
