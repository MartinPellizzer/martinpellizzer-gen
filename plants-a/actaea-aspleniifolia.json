    "intro": "Actaea aspleniifolia, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that bear large, palmately compound leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, fern-like appearance. Actaea aspleniifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
