    "intro": "Acaena macrocephala, commonly known as New Zealand spinach or mountain spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Acaena macrocephala is valued for its edible leaves, which have a spinach-like flavor and are used in traditional M\u0101ori cuisine.",

It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Its distribution reflects its ecological significance in the Southern Hemisphere.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrocephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly associated with disturbed sites and can form dense stands in grasslands and coastal areas. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
