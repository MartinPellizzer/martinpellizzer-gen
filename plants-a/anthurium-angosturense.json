    "intro": "Anthurium angosturense, commonly known as the \"Angostura arrowhead,\" is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium angosturense is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
