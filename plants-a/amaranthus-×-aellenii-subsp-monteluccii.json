    "intro": "Amaranthus \u00d7 aellenii subsp. monteluccii, commonly known as the mountain amaranth, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America.

The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, scale-like bracts that surround the flowering spike. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are sturdy and often branched.
