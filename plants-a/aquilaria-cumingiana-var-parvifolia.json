It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate with well-drained soil. Its leaves are small and opposite, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody fruits. The tree is also known for its ability to produce agarwood, a substance formed from the resinous secretion in response to fungal infections."
