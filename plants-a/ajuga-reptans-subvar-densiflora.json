    "intro": "Ajuga reptans subvar. densiflora, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
