    "intro": "Anthyllis italica, commonly known as Italian broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anthyllis italica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
