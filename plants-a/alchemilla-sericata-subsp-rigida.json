    "intro": "Alchemilla sericata subsp. rigida, commonly known as rigid lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions, it is a popular choice for garden planting."
