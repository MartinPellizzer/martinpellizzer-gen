    "intro": "Aster crithmifolius, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-blue, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in maritime environments. Aster crithmifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salty sea air."
