    "intro": "Armeriastrum tragacanthium, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, and it plays a role in preventing erosion in desert ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic flowers."
