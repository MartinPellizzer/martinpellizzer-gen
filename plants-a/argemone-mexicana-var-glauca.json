It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions despite its potential hazards."
