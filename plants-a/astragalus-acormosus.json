    "intro": "Astragalus acormosus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate arrangements, and its roots are often fibrous and adapted to arid environments. Astragalus acormosus is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is well-suited to semi-desert and steppe habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
