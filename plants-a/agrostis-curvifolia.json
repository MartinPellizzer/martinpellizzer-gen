    "intro": "Agrostis curvifolia, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves that are often curved at the tips, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis curvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
