    "intro": "Acrostichum bourgaeanum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive fronds, which can reach lengths of up to 6 meters, making it one of the largest fern species in the world. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its spores are dispersed by wind. The fronds are compound, with a distinctive feather-like structure that contributes to its ornamental value.",
