    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. kernensis, commonly known as Kern's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
