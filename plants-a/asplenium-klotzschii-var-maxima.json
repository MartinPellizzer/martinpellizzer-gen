    "intro": "Asplenium klotzschii var. maxima, commonly known as the giant spleenwort, is a fern species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in difficult soil conditions. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
