    "intro": "Artemisia palustris, commonly known as swamp wormwood, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, often bitter scent. Artemisia palustris plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its wetland environment."
