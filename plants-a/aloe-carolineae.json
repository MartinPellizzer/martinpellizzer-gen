    "intro": "Aloe carolineae, commonly known as Caroline's aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its spiky, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
