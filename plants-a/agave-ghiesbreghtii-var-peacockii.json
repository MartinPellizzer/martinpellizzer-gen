    "intro": "Agave ghiesbreghtii var. peacockii, commonly known as the Peacock Agave, is a striking succulent native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are blue-gray in color with a distinctive white variegation pattern resembling a peacock's tail. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
