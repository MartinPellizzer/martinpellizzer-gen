    "intro": "Anacyclus exalatus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spiny fruits. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a distinctive lobed shape. Anacyclus exalatus is adapted to withstand drought and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
