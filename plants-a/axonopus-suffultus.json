    "intro": "Axonopus suffultus, commonly known as the carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Axonopus suffultus is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions. It is frequently used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weed growth and its ornamental appearance."
