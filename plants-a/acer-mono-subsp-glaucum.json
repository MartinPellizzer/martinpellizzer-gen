    "intro": "Acer mono subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.",
