It features broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pinkish to reddish-orange flowers with a unique horn-shaped structure at the center. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias obovata thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats."
