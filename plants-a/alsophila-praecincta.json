    "intro": "Alsophila praecincta, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a soft, leathery texture. Alsophila praecincta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
