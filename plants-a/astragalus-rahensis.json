    "intro": "Astragalus rahensis, commonly known as the Persian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as deep root systems. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. Astragalus rahensis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
