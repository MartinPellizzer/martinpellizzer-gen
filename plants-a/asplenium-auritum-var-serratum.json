    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that have serrated margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the soil. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate foliage and ease of care in humid conditions."
