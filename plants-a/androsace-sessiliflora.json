    "intro": "Androsace sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant during early spring. Androsace sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
