    "intro": "Astragalus arrectus var. eremiticus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
