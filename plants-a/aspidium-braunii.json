    "intro": "Aspidium braunii, commonly known as the Braun's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water clarity by reducing algal growth. Aspidium braunii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
