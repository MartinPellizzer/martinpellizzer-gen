    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. latipinnum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
