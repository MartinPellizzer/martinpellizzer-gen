    "intro": "Apera triaristata, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences with three bristles at the base of each floret, giving it its common name. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Apera triaristata is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and birds."
