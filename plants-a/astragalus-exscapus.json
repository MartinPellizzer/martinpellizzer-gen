    "intro": "Astragalus exscapus, commonly known as the scabrous milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow or pale green, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer."
