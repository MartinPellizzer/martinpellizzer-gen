    "intro": "Abatia stellata, commonly known as the starleaf abatia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a star-like appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Abatia stellata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia stellata is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, and Peru. This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often in scrublands and rocky areas. Abatia stellata is known for its distinctive star-shaped flowers. Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Andean foothills and valleys.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia stellata was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. This plant has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi as well. It is often associated with moist to wet soil conditions and can thrive in a variety of light environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
