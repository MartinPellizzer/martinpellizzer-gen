    "intro": "Astragalus ciliolatus, commonly known as the fringed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus ciliolatus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
