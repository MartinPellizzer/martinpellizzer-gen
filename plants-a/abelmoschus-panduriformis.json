It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along riverbanks where it can receive ample sunlight. It is often associated with agricultural landscapes and can be found in both wild and cultivated environments. Its native range extends to regions with a humid climate and seasonal rainfall patterns.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus panduriformis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential agricultural use. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The plant's unique leaf shape and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions contribute to its introduction in new environments. However, it is important to monitor its spread due to potential ecological impacts. Its introduction has also been linked to traditional medicine and culinary practices in some regions."
