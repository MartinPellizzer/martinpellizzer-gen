    "intro": "Alchemilla achtarowii, commonly known as the Achtarowian lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alchemilla achtarowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
