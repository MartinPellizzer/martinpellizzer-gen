    "intro": "Anthemis viridis, commonly known as green everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for a single bloom but are actually made up of many tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is aromatic and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
