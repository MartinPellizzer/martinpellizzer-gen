    "intro": "Arthrostylidium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries. Arthrostylidium spinosum is adapted to thrive in shaded environments and can survive by drawing water and nutrients from its host."
