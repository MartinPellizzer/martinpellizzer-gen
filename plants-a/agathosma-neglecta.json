    "intro": "Agathosma neglecta, commonly known as the Cape garlic or wild garlic, is a small, aromatic shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its strong, pungent odor, similar to garlic, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Agathosma neglecta is used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in modern pharmacology."
