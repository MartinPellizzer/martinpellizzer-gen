    "intro": "Astrocarpa minor, commonly known as the lesser star-tongue, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Astrocarpa minor is typically short-lived, with a growth cycle adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
