    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize rocky crevices and gravelly soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia."
