    "intro": "Asplenium viride var. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to alpine regions. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
