    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum var. normale, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are broadly ovate and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in humid, temperate climates."
