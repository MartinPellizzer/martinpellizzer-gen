    "intro": "Argyreia reticulata, commonly known as the \"Cape jasmine\" or \"Bull's horn plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, featuring heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to cover trellises or fences."
