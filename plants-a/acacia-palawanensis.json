    "intro": "Acacia palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges, and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Acacia palawanensis plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia palawanensis is primarily native to the Philippines, specifically found in the island of Palawan. It thrives in lowland and montane forest areas, often growing in secondary vegetation. This species is commonly encountered in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia palawanensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in lowland areas, coastal regions, and disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant has been cultivated for its ornamental value and for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it has become an important species in reforestation and afforestation projects."
