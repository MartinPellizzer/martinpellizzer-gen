    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. glauca, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-gray blades that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to purplish in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Blue grama is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
