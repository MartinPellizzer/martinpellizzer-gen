    "intro": "Arthrolobus torulosus, commonly known as the torulose bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its root-like structures called rhizophores, which anchor it to substrates in freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. These vesicles are filled with water and can rapidly inflate to trap prey. Arthrolobus torulosus is typically found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
