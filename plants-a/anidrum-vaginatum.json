    "intro": "Anidrum vaginatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Anidrum vaginatum is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
