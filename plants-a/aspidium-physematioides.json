    "intro": "Aspidium physematioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Aspidium physematioides is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
