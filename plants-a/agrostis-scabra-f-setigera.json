    "intro": "Agrostis scabra f. setigera, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rough ground cover. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This form is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
