    "intro": "Anadelphia pubiglumis, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is adapted to arid environments. Its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. Anadelphia pubiglumis is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
