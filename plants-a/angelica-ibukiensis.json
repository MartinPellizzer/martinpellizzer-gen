    "intro": "Angelica ibukiensis, commonly known as the Japanese angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica ibukiensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
