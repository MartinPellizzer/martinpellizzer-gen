It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem contains a pungent, garlic-like odor, which is a distinguishing feature. Allium douglasii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
