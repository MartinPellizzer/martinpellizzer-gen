It is native to China, specifically the Zhejiang province, and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is a perennial evergreen, often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Aspidistra zhenganensis is adapted to thrive in shady, moist environments and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
