    "intro": "Arrhenatherum pratense, commonly known as meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
