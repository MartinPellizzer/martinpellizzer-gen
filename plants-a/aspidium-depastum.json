    "intro": "Aspidium depastum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, and damp woodlands. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium depastum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
