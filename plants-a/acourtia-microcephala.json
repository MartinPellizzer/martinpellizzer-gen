It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Acourtia microcephala is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",
