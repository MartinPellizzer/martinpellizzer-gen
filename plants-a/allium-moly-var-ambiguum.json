    "intro": "Allium moly var. ambiguum, commonly known as the wild leek or the garlic mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad and often have a garlic-like scent, and its flower stalks rise above the foliage, bearing small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are edible and have a strong onion-like flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
