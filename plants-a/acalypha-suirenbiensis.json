    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha suirenbiensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is commonly found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This species is also present in parts of northern Vietnam and eastern India, where similar environmental conditions exist. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found along stream banks and in rocky terrain. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha suirenbiensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm and humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability. Its introduction has led to its spread in several regions outside its native range. However, it is important to monitor its potential impact on local ecosystems."
