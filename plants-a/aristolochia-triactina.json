    "intro": "Aristolochia triactina, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic compounds."
