    "intro": "Acaciella santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander acacia, is a flowering plant native to Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and is characterized by its pod fruits. The plant is known for its small, yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves, which are typical of many species in its family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella santanderensis is primarily native to the Andean region of Colombia, specifically in the departments of Santander and Cesar. It is found in the cloud forests and humid montane areas at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level. This species is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of these high-altitude ecosystems. It plays an important ecological role in the biodiversity of the region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella santanderensis was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Venezuela. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
