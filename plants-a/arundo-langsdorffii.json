    "intro": "Arundo langsdorffii, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
