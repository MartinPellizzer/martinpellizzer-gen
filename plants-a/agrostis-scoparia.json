    "intro": "Agrostis scoparia, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Agrostis scoparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
