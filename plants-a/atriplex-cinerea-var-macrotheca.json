    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea var. macrotheca, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and oblong, with a leathery texture adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
