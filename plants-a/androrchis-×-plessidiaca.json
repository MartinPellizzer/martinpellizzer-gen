    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 plessidiaca, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between Androrchis lutescens and Plessisidia orchidoides. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a fibrous root system. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a pale lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
