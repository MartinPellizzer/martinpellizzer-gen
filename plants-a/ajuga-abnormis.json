    "intro": "Ajuga abnormis, commonly known as the strange bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover. Ajuga abnormis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
