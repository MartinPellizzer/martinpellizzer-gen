    "intro": "Aeollanthus pinnatifidus var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aeollanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
