    "intro": "Agrostis pubens, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense growth habit, which makes it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with slender, awned spikelets. Agrostis pubens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural habitats."
