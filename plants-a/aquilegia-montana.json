It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, yellow, and orange, often with a contrasting inner color. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are deeply lobed and fern-like in appearance. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aquilegia montana prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
