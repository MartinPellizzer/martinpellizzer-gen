It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain several seeds. Anuragia verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
