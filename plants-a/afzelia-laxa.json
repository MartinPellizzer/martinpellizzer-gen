    "intro": "Afzelia laxa, commonly known as the African teak or African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by winged fruits. Afzelia laxa thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
