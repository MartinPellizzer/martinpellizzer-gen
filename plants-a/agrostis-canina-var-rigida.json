    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. rigida, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass in certain regions."
