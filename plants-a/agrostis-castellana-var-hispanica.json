It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes, sandy soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry and saline conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
