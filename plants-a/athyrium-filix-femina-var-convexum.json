    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. convexum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a central, upright rhizome with multiple fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into delicate, feathery structures. Its foliage is typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance, giving it a distinctive, ornamental look. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
