    "intro": "Asperula stricta, commonly known as sweet willie or creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Asperula stricta is often used in rock gardens and as ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
