    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. hearstiorum, commonly known as the Hearst's bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, and it produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its red or orange berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This variety is closely related to other bearberry species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
