    "intro": "Abarema curvicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in shrubland and forest understory habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces edible seeds that are used in traditional cuisines. Abarema curvicarpa plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems.",

The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open wooded areas and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema curvicarpa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a tropical or subtropical climate. It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to high levels of moisture. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has shown potential as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
