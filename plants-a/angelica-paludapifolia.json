    "intro": "Angelica paludapifolia, commonly known as the marsh angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a distinct aromatic scent. The plant features large, compound leaves with a pinnate structure, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Angelica paludapifolia thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
