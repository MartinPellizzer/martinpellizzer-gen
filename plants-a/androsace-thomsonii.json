    "intro": "Androsace thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's mouse-eared moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
