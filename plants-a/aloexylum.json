    "intro": "Aloexylum, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in mountainous areas with high humidity. Aloexylum species usually have compound leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are also known for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making them resilient and adaptable."
