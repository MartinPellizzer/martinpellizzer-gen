    "intro": "Artemisia bicolor, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features silver-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
