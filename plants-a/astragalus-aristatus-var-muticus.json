    "intro": "Astragalus aristatus var. muticus, commonly known as the silent milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. This variety is notable for its reduced flowering compared to other Astragalus species, giving it its common name."
