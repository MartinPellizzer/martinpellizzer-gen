    "intro": "Asterochlaena morongii var. viscosa, commonly known as the viscid asterochlaena, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, viscid leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
