    "intro": "Abies forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and western China. It belongs to the genus Abies, which includes other firs such as the balsam fir and the grand fir. The tree is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cones that hang downward. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies forrestii is primarily native to China South-Central and Tibet. This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in temperate and subalpine climates. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. The plant is well adapted to the cold and humid conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in the forests of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude areas. It thrives in areas with ample sunlight and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for temperate forest ecosystems. This species is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate pollution. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, including landscaping and reforestation projects. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
