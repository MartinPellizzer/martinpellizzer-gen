    "intro": "Arcytophyllum puberulentum, commonly known as the pubescent sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine pubescence, which provides additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. Arcytophyllum puberulentum is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
