It is found in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States, as well as in northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. This cactus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open landscapes. It is commonly seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats where it can receive adequate sunlight. Due to its resilience, it is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus griseus was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert regions, particularly in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
