    "intro": "Anthobolus foveolatus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Anthobolus foveolatus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
