These plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, cruciform flowers that range in color from white to pink. Arabis species are generally hardy and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
