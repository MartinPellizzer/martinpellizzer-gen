It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Astragalus densiflorus is often found in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
