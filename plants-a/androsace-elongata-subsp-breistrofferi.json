    "intro": "Androsace elongata subsp. breistrofferi, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features a compact rosette of linear, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high sunlight exposure. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor, high-altitude ecosystems."
