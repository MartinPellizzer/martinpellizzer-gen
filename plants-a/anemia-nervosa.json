    "intro": "Anemia nervosa, commonly known as neurasthenia, is not a botanical term but a historical medical condition. It was once thought to be caused by a deficiency in vital energy or nerve strength. The term \"anemia nervosa\" suggests a connection to nervous system health rather than actual blood-related deficiencies. Botanically, it has no relevance to plant species or botanical characteristics. This condition is now understood to be related to mental health rather than botanical science."
