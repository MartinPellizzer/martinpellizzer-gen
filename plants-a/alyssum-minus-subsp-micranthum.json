    "intro": "Alyssum minus subsp. micranthum, commonly known as lesser alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant plantings."
