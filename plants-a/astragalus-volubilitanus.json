    "intro": "Astragalus volubilitanus, commonly known as the climbing milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across rocky or sandy substrates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus volubilitanus is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water-use strategies."
