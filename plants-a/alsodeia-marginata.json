    "intro": "Alsodeia marginata, commonly known as the coastal alsike, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments. Alsodeia marginata is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the seashore."
