It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to northern Europe and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
