    "intro": "Asplenium glandulosum subsp. bivalens, commonly known as the two-lobed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, glossy leaves that are often divided into two lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
