    "intro": "Andrachne robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Andrachne robinsonii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert and semi-desert regions."
