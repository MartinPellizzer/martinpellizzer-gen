    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to withstand salty sea air and harsh coastal conditions. Armeria vulgaris is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in rock gardens and coastal borders."
