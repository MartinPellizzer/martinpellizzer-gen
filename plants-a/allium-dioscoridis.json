It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears umbels of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and are rich in sulfur compounds that contribute to its pungent aroma. Allium dioscoridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitats."
