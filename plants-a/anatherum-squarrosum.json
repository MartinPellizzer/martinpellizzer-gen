    "intro": "Anatherum squarrosum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control. Anatherum squarrosum thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
