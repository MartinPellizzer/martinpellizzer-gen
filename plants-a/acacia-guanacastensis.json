It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dry to moist forests and along riverbanks. This species is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia guanacastensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions of Central and South America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats. This species is commonly used for its hard, durable wood and has been introduced for agroforestry and reforestation purposes. It can also be found in some parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia due to its adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
