    "intro": "Alsophila nothofagorum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to form dense clumps, and it plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the understory vegetation in forest ecosystems."
