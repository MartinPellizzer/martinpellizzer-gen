It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and smooth, gray-brown bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
