    "intro": "Aspiliopsis pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved aspilia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
