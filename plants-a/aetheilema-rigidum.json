    "intro": "Aetheilema rigidum, commonly known as the rigid flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed, forming a dense mat or clump. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and are usually green or brown in color. Aetheilema rigidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
