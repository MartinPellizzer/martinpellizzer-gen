    "intro": "Androsace conservatorum, commonly known as the conservation Androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
