    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. pusilla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This subspecies typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. pusilla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and small, spiky fruits. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
