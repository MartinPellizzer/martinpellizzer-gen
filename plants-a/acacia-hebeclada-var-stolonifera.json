    "intro": "Acacia hebeclada var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spherical heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hebeclada var. stolonifera is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hebeclada var. stolonifera was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for land rehabilitation and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature. The plant thrives in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it suitable for rehabilitation projects. It has been introduced in several countries in Africa and the Middle East for its ecological benefits. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation."
