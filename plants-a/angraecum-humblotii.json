    "intro": "Angraecum humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale blue flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific moth pollinators. Due to its rarity and unique features, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
