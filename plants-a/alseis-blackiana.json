    "intro": "Alseis blackiana, commonly known as the black alseis, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in pine flatwoods. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and turn red or orange in the fall. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Alseis blackiana is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
