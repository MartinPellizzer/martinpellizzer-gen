    "intro": "Acomis acoma, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Acomis acoma typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but lacks the characteristic milky sap found in those species.",
