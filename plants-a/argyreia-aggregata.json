    "intro": "Argyreia aggregata, commonly known as the \"Cocaine plant\" or \"Crimson beauty,\" is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its association with the illicit drug cocaine, it is heavily regulated in many countries."
