It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and its preference for rocky, well-drained soils. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often in canyons or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
