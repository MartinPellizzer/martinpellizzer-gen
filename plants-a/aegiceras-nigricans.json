    "intro": "Aegiceras nigricans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering pollutants. The plant's distinctive feature is its salt-excreting glands, which allow it to tolerate high salinity levels. Its small, dark green leaves are typically arranged in whorls, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Aegiceras nigricans is an essential component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
