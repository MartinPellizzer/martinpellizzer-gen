    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sphaerogemma is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea. This unique plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Socotra, where it thrives in rocky and coastal habitats. It is adapted to the extreme climate conditions of the island, including high temperatures and limited rainfall. The plant is known for its distinctive spherical seed pods and is a symbol of the island's unique biodiversity. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered an endemic species to Socotra.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sphaerogemma was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the southern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts on the regions where it has been established. However, it can also become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
