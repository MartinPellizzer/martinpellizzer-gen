    "intro": "Arenaria platysperma, commonly known as the broad-seeded sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are adapted to cold and dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Arenaria platysperma is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
