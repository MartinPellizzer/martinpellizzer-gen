    "intro": "Anemone filia subsp. scaposa, commonly known as the scaposa anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often bear showy, white or pink flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, with five to seven petal-like sepals that give the appearance of petals. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, leafless flowering stems, which are often shorter than the foliage. It prefers moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
