It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds in a capsule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
