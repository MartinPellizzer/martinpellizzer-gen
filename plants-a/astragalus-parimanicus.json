    "intro": "Astragalus parimanicus, commonly known as the Parimani milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its pods are typically slender and contain several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Astragalus parimanicus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils."
