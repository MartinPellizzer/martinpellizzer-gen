    "intro": "Amorphophallus flammeus, commonly known as the titan arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for its large, meaty inflorescence that resembles a corpse, hence its common name. The plant's botanical features include a massive underground tuber, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive long periods of dormancy. Its flowers consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful, petal-like bract. The titan arum is a member of the Araceae family and is known for its brief but dramatic flowering cycle, which can emit a strong odor reminiscent of decaying flesh."
