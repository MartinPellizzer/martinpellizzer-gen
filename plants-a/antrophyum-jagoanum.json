    "intro": "Antrophyum jagoanum, commonly known as the Jagoanum cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
