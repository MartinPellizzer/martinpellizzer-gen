It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, hairy stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The flower is unique, featuring a single, showy violet-blue blossom with a hairy, spurred lip. It blooms during the summer months and is pollinated by specific species of bees. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
