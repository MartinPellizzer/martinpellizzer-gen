    "intro": "Angraecum oeonioides, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, arching inflorescences with star-shaped flowers that are predominantly white with purple or pink markings. The plant typically grows on trees or rock surfaces, thriving in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar deep within the blooms. Angraecum oeonioides is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and rarity."
