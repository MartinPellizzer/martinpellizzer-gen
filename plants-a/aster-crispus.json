    "intro": "Aster crispus, commonly known as sea aster, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and vibrant blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a crinkled appearance, contributing to its common name. Aster crispus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
