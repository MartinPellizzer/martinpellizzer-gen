    "intro": "Aliciella monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Valley alicia, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Mono Basin in California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along the shores of Mono Lake. It has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
