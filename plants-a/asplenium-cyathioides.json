    "intro": "Asplenium cyathioides, commonly known as the Cyathioides spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in clusters called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium cyathioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in woodland gardens."
