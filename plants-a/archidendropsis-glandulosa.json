    "intro": "Archidendropsis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or greenish hues, and it produces legume-like pods containing seeds. The glandular features of its leaves are thought to play a role in deterring herbivores and may also aid in water retention."
