    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia megaladena is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the island of Tasmania. It thrives in a variety of habitats such as coastal areas, open forests, and heathlands. This species is commonly found in sandy soils and is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for native wildlife. Acacia megaladena is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia megaladena was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western Cape region. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it has also been used in reforestation projects. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas, leading to careful management practices."
