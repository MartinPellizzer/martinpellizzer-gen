    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. glastifolia, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to other members of the species."
