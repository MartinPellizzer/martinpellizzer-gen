    "intro": "Acalypha aliena, commonly known as the red leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Acalypha aliena is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha aliena is primarily native to Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and often grows in shaded to partially sunny environments. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha aliena was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich conditions. The plant has spread beyond its native range, becoming an invasive species in several regions. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation pose a threat to local ecosystems. Efforts are being made to control its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application."
