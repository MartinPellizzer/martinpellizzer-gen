    "intro": "Adiantum robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family. Adiantum robinsonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.",
