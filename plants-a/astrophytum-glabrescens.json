    "intro": "Astrophytum glabrescens, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular or cylindrical shape, often featuring a smooth, pale green stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
