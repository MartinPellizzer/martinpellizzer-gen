    "intro": "Arenaria apetala, commonly known as the barren sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria apetala plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
