    "intro": "Allium gherardii, commonly known as the plains garlic, is a perennial herb native to the central and western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Allium gherardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
