    "intro": "Aira pubescens, commonly known as the hairy grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces spikelet-based inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Aira pubescens is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
