    "intro": "Asplenium horridum var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
