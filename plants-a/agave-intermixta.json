    "intro": "Agave intermixta, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale yellow flowers. Agave intermixta is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It is widely cultivated for its sap, which is used in the production of tequila."
