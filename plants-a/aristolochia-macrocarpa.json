    "intro": "Aristolochia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant blossoms that are typically purple or greenish in color. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and vigorous climbing habit. However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
