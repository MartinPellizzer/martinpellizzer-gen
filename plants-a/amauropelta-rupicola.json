    "intro": "Amauropelta rupicola, commonly known as the rock shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in rocky or calcareous habitats. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in regions with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
