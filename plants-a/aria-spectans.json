    "intro": "Aria spectans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Aria spectans has specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air rather than the soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
