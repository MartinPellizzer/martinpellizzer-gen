It is a fern with a distinctive, creeping rhizome that produces fiddlehead-like fronds. The fronds are typically arching and have a delicate, feathery appearance, with pinnae that are narrow and often curled. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
