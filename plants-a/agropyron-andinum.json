    "intro": "Agropyron andinum, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Agropyron andinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
