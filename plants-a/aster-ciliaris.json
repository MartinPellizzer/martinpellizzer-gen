    "intro": "Aster ciliaris, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Aster ciliaris is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
