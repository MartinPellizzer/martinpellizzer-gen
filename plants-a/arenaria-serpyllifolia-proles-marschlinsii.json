    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia proles marschlinsii, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude habitats."
