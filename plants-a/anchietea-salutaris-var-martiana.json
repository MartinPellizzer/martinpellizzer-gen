    "intro": "Anchietea salutaris var. martiana, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically light green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering impurities."
