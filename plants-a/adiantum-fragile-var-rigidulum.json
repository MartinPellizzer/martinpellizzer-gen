    "intro": "Adiantum fragile var. rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm long. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-draining, acidic soil. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging fronds and the presence of small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its more robust relatives but is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care.",
