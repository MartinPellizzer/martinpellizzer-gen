    "intro": "Artemisia wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia wallichiana is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
