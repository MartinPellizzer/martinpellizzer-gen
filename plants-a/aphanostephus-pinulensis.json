    "intro": "Aphanostephus pinulensis, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spiky inflorescences that are often mistaken for pine cones, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. Aphanostephus pinulensis is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
