It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in wetlands and along waterways. The plant features hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a distinct celery scent when crushed. Its small white flowers cluster in umbrella-like structures, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Apium berula is valued for its culinary uses and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
