    "intro": "Alsine canadensis, commonly known as eastern sandreed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Alsine canadensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
