    "intro": "Antirrhinum elatinoides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant has a thick, waxy coating on its leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Antirrhinum elatinoides is adapted to survive in sandy or gravelly soils with low nutrient content."
