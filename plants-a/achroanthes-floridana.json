    "intro": "Achroanthes floridana, commonly known as the Florida ghostflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a flowering plant in the family Ericaceae, characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and elliptical, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",
