    "intro": "Aronicum atlanticum, commonly known as coastal parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and wetlands. The plant features a tall, slender stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, forming clusters at the top of the stem. The root system is fibrous, and the plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences."
