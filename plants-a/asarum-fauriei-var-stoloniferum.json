    "intro": "Asarum fauriei var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping asarum, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, reddish-purple leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike, which are typically hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats over the soil."
