    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. virgatus, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in wetland ecosystems. It is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
