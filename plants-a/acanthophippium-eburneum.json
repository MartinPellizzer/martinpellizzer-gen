    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium eburneum is primarily native to Borneo and Sumatera. This species is found in the tropical rainforests of these islands. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forest canopies. The plant is well adapted to the warm and wet climate of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these two Indonesian islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium eburneum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade, cultivation, and accidental transport. It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides, indicating its adaptability to anthropogenic environments. This plant is often spread by wind, water, or through attachment to animals and vehicles. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded areas. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage."
