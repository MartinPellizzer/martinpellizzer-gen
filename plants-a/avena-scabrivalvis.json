    "intro": "Avena scabrivalvis, commonly known as rough-valved oat, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that have a rough, sandpaper-like texture. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. Avena scabrivalvis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand harsh environmental conditions."
