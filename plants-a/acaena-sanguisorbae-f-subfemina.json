It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pink bracts that surround the small yellow flowers.

It typically grows in forest margins, shrublands, and rocky areas. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae f. subfemina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local biodiversity."
