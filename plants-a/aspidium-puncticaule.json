It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a pale or silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. Aspidium puncticaule is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
