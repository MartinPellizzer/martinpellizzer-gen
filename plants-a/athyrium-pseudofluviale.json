    "intro": "Athyrium pseudofluviale, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and botanical collections."
