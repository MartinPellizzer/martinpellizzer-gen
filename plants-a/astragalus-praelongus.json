    "intro": "Astragalus praelongus, commonly known as the longpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by elongated, slender pods. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Astragalus praelongus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
