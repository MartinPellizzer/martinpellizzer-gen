    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. majus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is valued for erosion control and as a forage crop."
