    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. jacutense, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to East Asia. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, often with a light green to dark green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
