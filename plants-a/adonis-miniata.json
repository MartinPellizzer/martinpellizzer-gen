    "intro": "Adonis miniata, commonly known as the miniature adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy, and it produces a cluster of small, yellowish flowers at the top of its stem. Adonis miniata is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered vulnerable in the wild.",
