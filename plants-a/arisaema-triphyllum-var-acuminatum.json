    "intro": "Arisaema triphyllum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the spiny arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf with a spiny margin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces a spadix enclosed within a spathe, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is also known for its toxic properties, particularly its sap, which can cause skin irritation."
