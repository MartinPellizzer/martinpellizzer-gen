    "intro": "Alternanthera paronychioides var. floribunda, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-pink foliage, which becomes more intense under full sunlight. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which are not the primary ornamental feature. This variety is prized for its bold coloration and is often used in container gardens or as a border plant in tropical climates."
