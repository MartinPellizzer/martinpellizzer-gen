    "intro": "Artanthe fuscescens, commonly known as the darkleaf artanthe, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Artanthe fuscescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
