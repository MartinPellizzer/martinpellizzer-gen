    "intro": "Acetosella monophylla, commonly known as the one-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a sour taste and making them suitable for use in salads or as a culinary herb. Acetosella monophylla is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing food for various insects and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.",
