    "intro": "Aristolochia purpusii, commonly known as the Chinese wild ginger, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, white aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
