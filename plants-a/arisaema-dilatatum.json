    "intro": "Arisaema dilatatum, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is often lobed and has a waxy texture. The plant produces a spadix enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically green with a yellow or white stripe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
