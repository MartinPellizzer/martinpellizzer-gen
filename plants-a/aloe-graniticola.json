    "intro": "Aloe graniticola, commonly known as the granite aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a textured surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in summer. This species is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
