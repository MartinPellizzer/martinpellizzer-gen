    "intro": "Aethusa capillacea, commonly known as hemlock water-dropwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of poison hemlock, though it is not toxic. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near water sources. Aethusa capillacea is an annual herb that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with a distinctive hollow stem that is often mistaken for poison hemlock."
