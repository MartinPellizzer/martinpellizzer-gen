It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, with five petals and two elongated nectar-rich spurs. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are palmately divided into three to five lobes. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, downy coating, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
