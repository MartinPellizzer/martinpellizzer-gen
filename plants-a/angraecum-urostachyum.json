    "intro": "Angraecum urostachyum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
