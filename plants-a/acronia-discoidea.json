    "intro": "Acronia discoidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, white, and highly fragrant, often blooming in late summer. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.",
