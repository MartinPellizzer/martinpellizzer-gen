    "intro": "Astragalus leucocladus, commonly known as white-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Astragalus leucocladus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
