    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. arenaria, commonly known as beachgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and the ability to form dense mats that stabilize sandy soils. This variant is particularly adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray, wind, and poor soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively and establish quickly in disturbed areas. It plays a vital ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
