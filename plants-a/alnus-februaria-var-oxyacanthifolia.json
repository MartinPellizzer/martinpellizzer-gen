    "intro": "Alnus februaria var. oxyacanthifolia, commonly known as the redstem alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in wetlands. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish beneath, and its small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring. It plays an important role in ecological succession, particularly in disturbed sites, and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. The variety is distinguished by its more pronounced red pigmentation in the leaf undersurface compared to the typical form."
