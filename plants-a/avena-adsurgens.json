    "intro": "Avena adsurgens, commonly known as the climbing oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend structures such as fences or trees. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are linear with a rough texture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense vegetation, which can impact local ecosystems."
