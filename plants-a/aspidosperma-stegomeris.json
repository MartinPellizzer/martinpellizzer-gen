    "intro": "Aspidosperma stegomeris, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and dense canopy of elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to large, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. These fruits contain a single, hard, dark seed surrounded by a sweet, creamy pulp. The tree is valued for its ecological role and the economic importance of its fruit in local communities."
