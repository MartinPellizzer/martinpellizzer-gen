    "intro": "Amarolea megacarpa, commonly known as the giant seed-bearing plant, is a unique species characterized by its large, fleshy fruits that can weigh several kilograms. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical regions with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. The plant's leaves are broad and lobed, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are showy and typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit, which contains a single large seed, is not only a botanical curiosity but also has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
