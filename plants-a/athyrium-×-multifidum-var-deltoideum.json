    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 multifidum var. deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid lady fern, is a hybrid fern species characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. Its delicate, lace-like appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and shaded landscapes. The varietal name 'deltoideum' refers to the triangular shape of its pinnae, adding to its distinctive botanical appearance."
