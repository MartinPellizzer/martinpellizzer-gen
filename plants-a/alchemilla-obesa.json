    "intro": "Alchemilla obesa, commonly known as the fat plant or broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla obesa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
