    "intro": "Astragalus rascheyanus, commonly known as the Raschey's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus rascheyanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
