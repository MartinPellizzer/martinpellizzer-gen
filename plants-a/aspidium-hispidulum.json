    "intro": "Aspidium hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium hispidulum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
