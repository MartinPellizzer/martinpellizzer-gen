    "intro": "Adoxa moschatellina var. insularis, commonly known as the island mosquito plant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific island environments in the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that resemble those of the mosquito plant, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is a member of the Adoxaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.",
