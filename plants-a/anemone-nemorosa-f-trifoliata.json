    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf anemone, is a variant of the wood anemone characterized by its trifoliate leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodland areas. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring. Its foliage consists of three leaflets, which are heart-shaped and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
