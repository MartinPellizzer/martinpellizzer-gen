    "intro": "Avena flexuosa var. discolor, commonly known as the red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Avena flexuosa var. discolor is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
