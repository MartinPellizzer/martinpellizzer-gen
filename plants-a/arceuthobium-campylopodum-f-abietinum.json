    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum f. abietinum, commonly known as the fir dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees, particularly firs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming small, spherical growths on the branches. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers and seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced tree growth and vitality. Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced morphology and specialized structures for attachment and nutrient absorption."
