    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and reddish-brown inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of florets that mature into pale yellow to brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
