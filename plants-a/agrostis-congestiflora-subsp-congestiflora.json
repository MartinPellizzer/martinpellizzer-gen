It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
