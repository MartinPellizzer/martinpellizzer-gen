    "intro": "Agrostis borealis subsp. viridissima, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often clustered at the tip of the stem. The species plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
