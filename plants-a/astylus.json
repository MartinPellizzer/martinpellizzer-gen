These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are adapted for pollination by insects. Astylus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various pollinators."
