    "intro": "Androsace angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense mat of dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
