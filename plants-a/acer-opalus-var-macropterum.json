    "intro": "Acer opalus var. macropterum, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, symmetrical shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The Norway maple is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
