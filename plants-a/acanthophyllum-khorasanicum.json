    "intro": "Acanthophyllum khorasanicum, commonly known as the Khorasan spiny shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching structure and dense covering of spines. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Acanthophyllum khorasanicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert steppes and dunes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones characterized by low vegetation cover and extreme climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum khorasanicum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Iran. It is commonly found in sandy and rocky soils where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is well adapted to low precipitation and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in these ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific climatic zones where it can survive with minimal water availability."
