    "intro": "Acrotriche fasciculiflora, commonly known as the clustered sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy soils with minimal water availability. Acrotriche fasciculiflora is an important component of coastal and inland sand dune ecosystems.",
