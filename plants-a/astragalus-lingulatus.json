    "intro": "Astragalus lingulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are usually pale blue to purple, arranged in clusters. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus lingulatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
