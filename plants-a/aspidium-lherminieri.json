    "intro": "Aspidium lherminieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like rocks or soil. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
