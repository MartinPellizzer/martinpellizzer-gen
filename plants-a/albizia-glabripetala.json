    "intro": "Albizia glabripetala, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a silky texture due to fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several flat, elliptical seeds. Albizia glabripetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
