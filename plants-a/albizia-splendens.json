    "intro": "Albizia splendens, commonly known as the splendour acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Albizia splendens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
