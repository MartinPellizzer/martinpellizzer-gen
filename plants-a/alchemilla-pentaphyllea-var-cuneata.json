It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicle-like clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, textured appearance."
