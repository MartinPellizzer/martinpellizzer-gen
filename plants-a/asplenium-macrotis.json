    "intro": "Asplenium macrotis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-like shape, and are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Asplenium macrotis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
