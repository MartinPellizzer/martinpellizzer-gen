    "intro": "Acrotrema thwaitesii var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous acrotrema, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread along the soil surface. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, consisting of a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
