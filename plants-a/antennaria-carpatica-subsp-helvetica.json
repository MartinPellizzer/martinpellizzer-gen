    "intro": "Antennaria carpatica subsp. helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils."
