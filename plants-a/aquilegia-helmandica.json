    "intro": "Aquilegia helmandica, commonly known as the Helmand columbine, is a flowering plant native to Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
