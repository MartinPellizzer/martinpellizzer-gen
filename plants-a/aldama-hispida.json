    "intro": "Aldama hispida, commonly known as the hairy aldama, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Aldama hispida is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
