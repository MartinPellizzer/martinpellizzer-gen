    "intro": "Aulospermum duchesnense, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its showy purple-blue flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aulospermum duchesnense is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
