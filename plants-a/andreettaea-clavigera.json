    "intro": "Andreettaea clavigera, commonly known as the Brazilian lily, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
