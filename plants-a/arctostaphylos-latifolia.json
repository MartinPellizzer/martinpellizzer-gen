    "intro": "Arctostaphylos latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf manzanita, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, reddish bark and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Arctostaphylos latifolia is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
