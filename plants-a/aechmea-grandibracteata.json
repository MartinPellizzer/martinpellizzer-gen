    "intro": "Aechmea grandibracteata, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small animals. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and sword-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Aechmea grandibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
