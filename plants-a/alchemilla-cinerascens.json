It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Alchemilla cinerascens is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
