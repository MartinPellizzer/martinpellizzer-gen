It is characterized by its small, pale green to reddish leaves and clusters of tiny white or pinkish flowers. This variant is distinguished by its variable coloration and subtle morphological differences from the typical *Alopecurus myosuroides*. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
