    "intro": "Arenaria lessertiana, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Arenaria lessertiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its arid and rocky habitats."
