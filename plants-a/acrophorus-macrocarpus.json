It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing water surfaces and supporting biodiversity.",
