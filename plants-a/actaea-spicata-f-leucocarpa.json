    "intro": "Actaea spicata f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited bugbane, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, followed by distinctive white, fleshy berries that are edible but have a mild, sweet taste. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique fruiting structures, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes.",
