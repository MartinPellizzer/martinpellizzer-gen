    "intro": "Ardisia congesta, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruiting display. Ardisia congesta is often cultivated in shaded gardens and as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
