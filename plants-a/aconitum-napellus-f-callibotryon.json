    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. callibotryon, commonly known as the Alpine garden aconite, is a horticultural form of the European aconite. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more upright stems compared to the typical species. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall spires. Its foliage consists of doubly pinnate leaves that are deeply divided and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.",
