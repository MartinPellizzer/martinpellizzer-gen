    "intro": "Aulomyrcia reticulata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
