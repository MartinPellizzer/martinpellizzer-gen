    "intro": "Alatiliparis spiralipetala, commonly known as the spiral-petaled alata, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its intricate, spiraling petal arrangement. It belongs to the family Alatiliparaceae and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale blue with a subtle violet hue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
