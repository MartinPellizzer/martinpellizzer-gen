    "intro": "Anacantha, commonly known as prickly burr or goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that enclose the flowers, often giving it a distinctive and rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Africa, Asia, and Australia. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Anacantha species are often used in traditional medicine and can be invasive in some areas."
