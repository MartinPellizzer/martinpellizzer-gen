    "intro": "Aristida rigidiseta, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Aristida rigidiseta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
