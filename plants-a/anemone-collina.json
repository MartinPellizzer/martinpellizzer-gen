It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant features showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, with petal-like sepals that resemble true petals. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are typically covered in fine hairs. Anemone collina is often found in moist, well-drained habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
