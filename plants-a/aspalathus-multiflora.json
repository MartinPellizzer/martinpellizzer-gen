    "intro": "Aspalathus multiflora, commonly known as the African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is a key component of fynbos vegetation. Aspalathus multiflora is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of Rooibos tea."
