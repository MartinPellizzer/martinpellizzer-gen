    "intro": "Asclepias consanguinea, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tufted seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a valuable host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Botanically, it belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains latex."
