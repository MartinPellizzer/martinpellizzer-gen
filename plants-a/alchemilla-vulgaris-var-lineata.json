    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. lineata, commonly known as the variegated lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features attractive, shield-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in moist, shady woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover. The leaves are also known for their slightly sticky texture and historical use in herbal remedies."
