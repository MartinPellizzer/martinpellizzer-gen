    "intro": "Asplenium schomburgkianum, commonly known as the Schomburgk's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are found on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium schomburgkianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
