    "intro": "Abies religiosa subsp. religiosa, commonly known as the sacred fir, is a species of fir tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a single layer. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. The plant has cultural significance in indigenous communities and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles.",

    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies religiosa subsp. religiosa was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude areas. It is commonly found in parts of central and southern Mexico, where it thrives in temperate forests. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental or for reforestation purposes. However, its spread is limited by its specific climatic requirements and geographic distribution."
