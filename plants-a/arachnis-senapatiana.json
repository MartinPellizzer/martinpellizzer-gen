    "intro": "Arachnis senapatiana, commonly known as the Himalayan arachnis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Arachnis senapatiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
