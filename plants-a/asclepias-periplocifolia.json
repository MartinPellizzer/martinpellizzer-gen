    "intro": "Asclepias periplocifolia, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods that contain numerous small, fluffy seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias periplocifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
