    "intro": "Astragalus antisellii var. gaviotus, commonly known as the Gaviotus milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone conditions. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological significance and potential medicinal properties."
