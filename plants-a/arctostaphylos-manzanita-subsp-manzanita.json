    "intro": "Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp. manzanita, commonly known as manzanita, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its gnarled, reddish-brown stems and evergreen, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. These flowers give way to small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. Manzanita is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
