It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
