    "intro": "Athyrium solutum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with short, stout pinnae that are arranged in a dense, upright manner. Athyrium solutum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
