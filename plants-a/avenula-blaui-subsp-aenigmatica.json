It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, blue-violet flowers, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is distinguished by its unique morphological traits and limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
