    "intro": "Arthrochilium xanthophaeum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. The orchid has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions."
