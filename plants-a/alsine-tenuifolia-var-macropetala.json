    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with thin, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its flowers have showy, elongated petals that distinguish it from other members of the Caryophyllaceae family. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
