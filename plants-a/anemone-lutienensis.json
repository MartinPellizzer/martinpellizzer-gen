    "intro": "Anemone lutienensis, commonly known as the Lutien anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with a distinctive central cone-shaped structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, often with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
