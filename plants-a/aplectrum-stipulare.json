    "intro": "Aplectrum stipulare, commonly known as the stipule leafless orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, fleshy stems. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
