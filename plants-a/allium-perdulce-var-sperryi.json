    "intro": "Allium perdulce var. sperryi, commonly known as the Sperry's sweet leek, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Allium genus. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
