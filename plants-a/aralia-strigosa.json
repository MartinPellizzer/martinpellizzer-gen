    "intro": "Aralia strigosa, commonly known as the rough aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Aralia strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
