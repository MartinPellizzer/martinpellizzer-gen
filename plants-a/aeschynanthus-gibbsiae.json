    "intro": "Aeschynanthus gibbsiae, commonly known as the glandular ivy or the hanging lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
