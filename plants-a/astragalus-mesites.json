    "intro": "Astragalus mesites, commonly known as the Mesite milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus mesites plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
