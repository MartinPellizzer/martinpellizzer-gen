    "intro": "Argyroderma framesii subsp. framesii, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-grey thallus that often has a powdery or granular surface. This lichen typically grows on calcareous rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like lobes that are usually flat and attached to the substrate. The species is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a common indicator of rocky, sunny habitats."
