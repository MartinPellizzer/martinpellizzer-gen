    "intro": "Anthurium polytomum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, a feature typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium polytomum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
