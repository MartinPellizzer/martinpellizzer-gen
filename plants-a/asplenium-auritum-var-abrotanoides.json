    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. abrotanoides, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped fronds that often have a distinctive ear-like appearance. The plant typically grows on rocks or soil in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
