    "intro": "Asplenium henryi, commonly known as Henry's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the undersides of its fronds. Native to Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
