It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow center. The plant produces a dense cluster of flowers on a single, erect stem, which blooms during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Angraecum muriculatum is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops."
