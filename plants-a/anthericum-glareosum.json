    "intro": "Anthericum glareosum, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
