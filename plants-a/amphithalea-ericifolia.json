    "intro": "Amphithalea ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Amphithalea ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
