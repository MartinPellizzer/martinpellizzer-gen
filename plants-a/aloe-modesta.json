    "intro": "Aloe modesta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in a thick layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often have a reddish tinge at the tips. Aloe modesta is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
