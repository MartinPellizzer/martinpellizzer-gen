    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and feathery inflorescences that produce small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. This versatile plant is cultivated for its edible grains and has been used historically for both food and animal forage."
