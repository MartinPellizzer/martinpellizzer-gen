    "intro": "Arenaria kingii var. uintahensis, commonly known as Uintah sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
