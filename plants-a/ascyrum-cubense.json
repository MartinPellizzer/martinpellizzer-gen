It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Ascyrum cubense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
