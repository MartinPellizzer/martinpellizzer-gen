It typically features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra regions. Arenaria dahurica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
