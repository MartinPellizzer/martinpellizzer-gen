    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 irenemantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 irenemantoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
