    "intro": "Arum italicum var. concolor, commonly known as the Italian arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is typically deep green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, white to green spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
