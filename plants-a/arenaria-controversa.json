    "intro": "Arenaria controversa, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Arenaria controversa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
