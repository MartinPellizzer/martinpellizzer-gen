    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ulmifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as forest edges, shrublands, and disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution extends to some regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ulmifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It is commonly used in gardens and as a ground cover because of its rapid growth and ability to thrive in both sunny and partially shaded areas. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain areas where it spreads beyond cultivated settings. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its unintended spread."
