It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in regions such as southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
