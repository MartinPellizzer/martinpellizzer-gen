    "intro": "Aloe perfoliata var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or the low aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
