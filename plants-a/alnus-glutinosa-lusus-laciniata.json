    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa lusus laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist soils near streams or in wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
