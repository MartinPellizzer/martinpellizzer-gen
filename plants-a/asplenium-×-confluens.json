    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 confluens, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green with a leathery texture and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Asplenium \u00d7 confluens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
