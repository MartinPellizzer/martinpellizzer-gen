The plant has compound leaves with multiple pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
