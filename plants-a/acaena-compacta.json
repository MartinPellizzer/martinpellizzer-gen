    "intro": "Acaena compacta, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain hard, dark seeds. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense mats on the ground. Acaena compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena compacta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Acaena compacta plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena compacta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth and attractive foliage. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, spreading aggressively in native ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native plant species."
