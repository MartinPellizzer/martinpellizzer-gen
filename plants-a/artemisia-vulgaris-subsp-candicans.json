    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. candicans, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. The leaves contain volatile oils, giving the plant its distinctive aromatic properties."
