    "intro": "Aleuritopteris affinis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
