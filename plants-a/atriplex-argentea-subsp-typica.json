    "intro": "Atriplex argentea subsp. typica, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Atriplex argentea subsp. typica is often found in salt-affected soils and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
