    "intro": "Atriplex incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its glabrous, often grayish-green leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex incisa is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing soil in harsh environments. It is also used in traditional medicine by some Indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
