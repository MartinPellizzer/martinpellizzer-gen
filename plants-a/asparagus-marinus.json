    "intro": "Asparagus marinus, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant has fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and salty conditions. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. The edible stems are sometimes harvested for culinary use, though they are typically consumed raw or cooked."
