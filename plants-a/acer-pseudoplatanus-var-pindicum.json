    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. pindicum, commonly known as the Pindus maple, is a variant of the common maple native to the Pindus Mountains in northern Greece. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. The Pindus maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to mountainous environments.",
