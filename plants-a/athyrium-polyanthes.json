    "intro": "Athyrium polyanthes, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or semi-upright. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and indoor settings."
