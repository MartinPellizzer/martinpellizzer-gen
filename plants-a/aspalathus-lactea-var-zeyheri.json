It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its low-growing nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
