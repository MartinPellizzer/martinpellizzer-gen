    "intro": "Achyrophorus angustissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellowish to brownish flower heads that resemble small daisies. Native to the northern regions of North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found growing in clusters, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its native habitat.",
