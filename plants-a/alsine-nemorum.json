    "intro": "Alsine nemorum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or violet. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. The species is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for certain insects."
