    "intro": "Artemisia maritima subsp. humifusa, commonly known as coastal wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a strong aromatic scent, and it produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils. Its medicinal properties have also been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
