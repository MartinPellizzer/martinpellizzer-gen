    "intro": "Amanoa congesta, commonly known as the clustered amanoa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Amanoa congesta plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
