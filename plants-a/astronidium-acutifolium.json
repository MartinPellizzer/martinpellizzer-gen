    "intro": "Astronidium acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed starling tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are acuminate at the tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
