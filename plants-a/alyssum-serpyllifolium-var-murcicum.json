    "intro": "Alyssum serpyllifolium var. murcicum, commonly known as creeping allyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form a dense mat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
