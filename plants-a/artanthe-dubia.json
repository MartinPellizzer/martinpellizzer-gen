    "intro": "Artanthe dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale pink or white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Artanthe dubia is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
