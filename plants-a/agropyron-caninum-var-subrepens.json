    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. subrepens, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a fibrous root system and dense, prostrate growth habit, allowing it to form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a resilient species in various ecological settings."
