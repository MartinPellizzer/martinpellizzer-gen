    "intro": "Acanthophyllum kabulicum, commonly known as the Kabul spiny bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.",

This plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in areas with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum kabulicum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is adapted to harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies focusing on drought-resistant flora. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
