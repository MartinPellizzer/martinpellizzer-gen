    "intro": "Astragalus newberryi var. eriocarpus, commonly known as the Newberry milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
