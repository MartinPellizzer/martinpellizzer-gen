    "intro": "Apocynum platyanthum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its latex is milky and contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals. Apocynum platyanthum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species for pollinator support."
