    "intro": "Athyrium mesosorum, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
