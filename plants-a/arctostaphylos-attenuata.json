    "intro": "Arctostaphylos attenuata, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters, which bloom in white or pink during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. Arctostaphylos attenuata is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils."
