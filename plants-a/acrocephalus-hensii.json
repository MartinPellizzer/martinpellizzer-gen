    "intro": "Acrocephalus hensii, commonly known as the Henslow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or damp environments such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats. Acrocephalus hensii is valued for its ecological importance in supporting insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity.",
