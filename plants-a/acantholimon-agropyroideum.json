    "intro": "Acantholimon agropyroideum, commonly known as the tufted sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.",

It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the natural vegetation of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon agropyroideum was mainly introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and gravelly soils. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often seen in areas with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in these environments."
