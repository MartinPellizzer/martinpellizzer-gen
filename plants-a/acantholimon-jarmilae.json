    "intro": "Acantholimon jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It is a perennial species with a compact growth habit, often reaching heights of less than 20 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the alpine and subalpine zones. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of the region. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon jarmilae was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, railway embankments, and cultivated fields. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Europe. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
