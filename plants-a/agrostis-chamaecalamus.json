    "intro": "Agrostis chamaecalamus, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a dense growth habit that forms a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and durability, it is also cultivated for ornamental and turfgrass purposes."
