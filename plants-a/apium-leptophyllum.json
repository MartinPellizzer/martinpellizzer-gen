    "intro": "Apium leptophyllum, commonly known as slender cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, hollow stems and small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. Its leaves are finely divided and often resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Apium leptophyllum is typically found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
