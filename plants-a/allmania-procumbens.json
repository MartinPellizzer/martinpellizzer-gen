    "intro": "Allmania procumbens, commonly known as the Florida bellflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Allmania procumbens thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds."
