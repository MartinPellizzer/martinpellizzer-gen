    "intro": "Anneslia eriophylla, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, typical of xerophytic plants. Anneslia eriophylla is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
