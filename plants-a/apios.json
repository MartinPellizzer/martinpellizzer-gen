    "intro": "Apios, commonly known as the wild bean or groundnut, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes several species, with Apios americana being the most well-known in North America. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The fruit is a legume pod containing edible seeds, while the roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Apios species are often found in moist, wooded areas and are valued for their ecological and potential nutritional benefits."
