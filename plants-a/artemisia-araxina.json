It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in flat-topped inflorescences, which bloom in late summer.
