    "intro": "Atriplex leucoclada var. inamoena, commonly known as white saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt lakes, and saline soils, demonstrating high tolerance to salt and drought. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, smooth seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions."
