    "intro": "Astragalus ludlowii, commonly known as Ludlow's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
