    "intro": "Acostia gracilis, commonly known as the slender water plant, is a delicate aquatic herb native to the wetlands of South America. It features slender, branching stems that float on the water's surface, with small, pale green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting insects such as beetles and flies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is adapted to low-light conditions. Due to its fragile structure, it is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters.",
