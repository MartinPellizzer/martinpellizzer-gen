It is a spineless, columnar cactus that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Its stems are cylindrical and covered with a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
