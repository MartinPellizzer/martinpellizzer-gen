    "intro": "Audibertiella incana, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. Its surface is often covered with a fine, silky layer of hairs, which gives it its common name. Audibertiella incana is typically found on bark and rock surfaces in temperate forest environments."
