    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha leptostachya var. carpinifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in forest understories. It is known for its ornamental value, with striking foliage that makes it a popular choice in horticulture. The plant's distribution is closely tied to its preference for humid climates and is relatively localized within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha leptostachya var. carpinifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the early 20th century through horticultural trade. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
