    "intro": "Arisarum simorrhinum var. subexertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety, with a distinctive midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
