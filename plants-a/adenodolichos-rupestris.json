    "intro": "Adenodolichos rupestris, commonly known as the rock bean, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry, arid environments. Adenodolichos rupestris is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.",
