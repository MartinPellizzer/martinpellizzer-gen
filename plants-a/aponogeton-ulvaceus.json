It features broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that develop underwater and are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in water, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life.
