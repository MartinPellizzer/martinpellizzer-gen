    "intro": "Aylostera odehnalii, commonly known as the Odehnal's aylostera, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its unique morphology includes finely divided leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aylostera odehnalii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
