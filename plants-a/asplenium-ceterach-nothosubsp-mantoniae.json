    "intro": "Asplenium ceterach nothosubsp. mantoniae, commonly known as the Mantoniae spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along streams or in rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a distinctive, serrated edge. This nothosubspecies is considered a hybrid form, likely resulting from natural crosses between A. ceterach and other related species."
