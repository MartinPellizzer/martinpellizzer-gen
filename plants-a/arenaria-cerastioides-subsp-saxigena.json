    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides subsp. saxigena, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its subspecific name, *saxigena*, refers to its preference for saxicolous (rock-dwelling) habitats."
