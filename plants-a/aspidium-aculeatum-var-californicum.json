    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. californicum, commonly known as the California holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moderate climates."
