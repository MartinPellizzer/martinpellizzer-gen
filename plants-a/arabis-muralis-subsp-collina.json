    "intro": "Arabis muralis subsp. collina, commonly known as wall arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found growing on walls, cliffs, and slopes. Its hardy nature and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
