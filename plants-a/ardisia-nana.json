    "intro": "Ardisia nana, commonly known as dwarf ardisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features. Ardisia nana thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
