    "intro": "Artocarpus subrotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that give it its common name. The tree produces large, spiky fruits that are typically harvested when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a texture similar to breadfruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other breadfruit species. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has potential uses in traditional medicine and agriculture."
