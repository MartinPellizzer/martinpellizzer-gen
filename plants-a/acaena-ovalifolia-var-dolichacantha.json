    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. dolichacantha, commonly known as the long-stemmed prostrate acacia, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense mats on the ground. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",

This variant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its spiny growth habit.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. dolichacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in grasslands. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit. However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects."
