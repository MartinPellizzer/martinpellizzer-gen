It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green in color. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and reforestation efforts."
