    "intro": "Aeollanthus stormsioides, commonly known as the storm's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns resembling a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree bark without drawing nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat destruction and its extreme rarity, Aeollanthus stormsioides is considered critically endangered."
