    "intro": "Anchusa vulgaris, commonly known as the common blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring a sturdy stem and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom from June to September, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Anchusa vulgaris is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
