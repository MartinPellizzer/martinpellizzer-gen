    "intro": "Alsophila phalerata var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or coastal areas. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
