    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as slender alsike clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
