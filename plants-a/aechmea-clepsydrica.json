    "intro": "Aechmea clepsydrica, commonly known as the water tank bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rain and debris. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and its flowers are often bright red or orange, adding visual contrast. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea clepsydrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting small aquatic organisms in its leaf axils."
