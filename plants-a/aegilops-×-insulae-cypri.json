    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 insulae-cypri, commonly known as the Cyprus wild rye, is a naturally occurring hybrid species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its genetic makeup results from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Aegilops umbrosa, contributing to its unique morphological traits. Due to its adaptability and potential for agricultural use, it is of interest in plant breeding programs."
