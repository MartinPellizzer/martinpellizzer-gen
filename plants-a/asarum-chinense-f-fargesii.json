    "intro": "Asarum chinense f. fargesii, commonly known as the Yunnan wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it is not recommended for culinary or medicinal use without proper preparation."
