    "intro": "Asparagus collinus, commonly known as the mountain asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles and attract pollinators such as bees. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Asparagus collinus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows."
