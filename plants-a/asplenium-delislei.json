    "intro": "Asplenium delislei, commonly known as the Delisle's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium delislei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
