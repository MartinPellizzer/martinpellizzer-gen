    "intro": "Acacia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Acacia glandulifera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its resilience to drought. It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and forage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia glandulifera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and suitable climate conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia glandulifera was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts on local ecosystems."
