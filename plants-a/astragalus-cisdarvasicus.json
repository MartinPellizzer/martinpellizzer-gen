    "intro": "Astragalus cisdarvasicus, commonly known as the Cisdarvasica milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
