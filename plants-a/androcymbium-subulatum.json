    "intro": "Androcymbium subulatum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
