    "intro": "Androsace halleri subsp. nuria, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or white petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
