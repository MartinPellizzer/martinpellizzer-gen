It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw form. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, open areas. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a species of ecological interest."
