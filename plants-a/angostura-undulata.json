It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf patterns and striking, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
