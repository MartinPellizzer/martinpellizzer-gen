    "intro": "Androsace henryi var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Mountain androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
