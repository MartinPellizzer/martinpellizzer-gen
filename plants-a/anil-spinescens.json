    "intro": "Anil spinescens, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. Its berries contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
