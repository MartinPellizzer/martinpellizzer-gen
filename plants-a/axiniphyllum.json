    "intro": "Axiniphyllum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, and it relies on water for pollination. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Axiniphyllum plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
