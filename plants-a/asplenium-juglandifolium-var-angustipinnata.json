    "intro": "Asplenium juglandifolium var. angustipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate shield fern, is a variant of the walnut-leaf spleenwort. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
