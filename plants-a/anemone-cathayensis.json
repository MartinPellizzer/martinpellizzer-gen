    "intro": "Anemone cathayensis, commonly known as the Chinese anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features showy, white to pink flowers with a prominent central cone, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
