    "intro": "Arum phalliferum, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a broad, petal-like spathe. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decay, which serves to attract its primary pollinators\u2014flies and beetles. Its botanical structure includes a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and water, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Arum phalliferum is also notable for its unique reproductive strategy, where the spadix generates heat to enhance the release of its odor and facilitate pollination."
