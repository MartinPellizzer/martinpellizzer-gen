    "intro": "Artemisia mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Mongolia and northern China. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves contain volatile oils that give it a strong, bitter scent. Artemisia mongolica is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
