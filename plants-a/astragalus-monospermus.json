    "intro": "Astragalus monospermus, commonly known as the single-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a single, spherical seed pod that contains a single, smooth seed, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert environments. Astragalus monospermus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
