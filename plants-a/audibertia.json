    "intro": "Audibertia, commonly known as the African bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. They typically grow as annual or biennial herbs, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Audibertia species are known for their ability to thrive in poor soils and their role in nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
