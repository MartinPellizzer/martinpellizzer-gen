    "intro": "Astragalus drepanophorus, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Astragalus drepanophorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native environment."
