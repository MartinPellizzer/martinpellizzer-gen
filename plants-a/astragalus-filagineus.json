    "intro": "Astragalus filagineus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus filagineus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
