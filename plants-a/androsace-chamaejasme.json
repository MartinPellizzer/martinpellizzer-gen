    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and its flowers are usually white or pink, borne on short stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
