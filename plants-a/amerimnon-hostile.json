    "intro": "Amerimnon hostile, commonly known as the venomous nightshade, is a rare and toxic plant native to the dense rainforests of South America. It features dark green, broad leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant's most notable characteristic is its bright red berries, which contain potent alkaloids and are highly poisonous if ingested. Despite its dangers, it plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing food for specific insect species. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
