    "intro": "Atriplex rubra, commonly known as red orache, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which help it conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Atriplex rubra is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline conditions."
