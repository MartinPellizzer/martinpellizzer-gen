    "intro": "Artanthe scabriuscula, commonly known as roughleaf artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has gray-green, rough-textured leaves. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Artanthe scabriuscula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
