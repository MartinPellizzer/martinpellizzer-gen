    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. scabriflora, commonly known as the rough-flowered three-awn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bristly, awned flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry environments."
