It typically grows to a height of about 1-2 meters and features glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The fruit has a smooth, thin rind and a creamy, sweet flesh with a mild, acidic flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in home gardens."
