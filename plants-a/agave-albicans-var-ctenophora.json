    "intro": "Agave albicans var. ctenophora, commonly known as the white agave with a feathered margin, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a distinctive feather-like edge that gives the plant its varietal name. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
