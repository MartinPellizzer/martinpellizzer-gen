    "intro": "Asplenium macrocarpon, commonly known as the large-fruited spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves, and it produces large, fleshy, edible spores that are a food source for various invertebrates. Asplenium macrocarpon is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
