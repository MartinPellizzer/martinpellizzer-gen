It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
