    "intro": "Ayenia hirta, commonly known as the hairy ayenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Ayenia hirta is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
