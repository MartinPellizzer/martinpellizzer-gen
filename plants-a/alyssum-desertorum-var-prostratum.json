    "intro": "Alyssum desertorum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use in dry landscapes."
