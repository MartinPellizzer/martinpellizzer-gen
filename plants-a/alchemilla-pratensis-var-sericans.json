The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows, and is often found in calcareous soils. Alchemilla pratensis var. sericans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
