    "intro": "Allium macrostemon, commonly known as the broad-leaf garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Himalayas. It features a bulb composed of several small, rounded cloves, which are covered in a papery outer skin. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences with numerous small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a garlic-like scent when crushed. Allium macrostemon is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
