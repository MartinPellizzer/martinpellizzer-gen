    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. racemulosa, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces upright stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
