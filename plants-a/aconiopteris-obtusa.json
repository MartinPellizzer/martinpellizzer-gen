    "intro": "Aconiopteris obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's robust and adaptable nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.",
