    "intro": "Aubrieta floribunda, commonly known as the Persian wallflower, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with trailing stems and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for well-drained soils. Aubrieta floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun."
