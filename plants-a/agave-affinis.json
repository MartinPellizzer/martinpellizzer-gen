    "intro": "Agave affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by fleshy, spiky fruits. Agave affinis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
