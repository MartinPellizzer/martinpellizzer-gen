    "intro": "Acmispon pilosus, commonly known as hairy needlepod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Acmispon pilosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.",
