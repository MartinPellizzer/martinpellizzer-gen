    "intro": "Agrostis alba, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is slender and often drooping. Agrostis alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
