    "intro": "Almaleea paludosa, commonly known as the swamp almaleea, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Almaleea paludosa plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
