    "intro": "Asterocephalus simplex, commonly known as the simple starhead, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically includes species with medicinal properties. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster at the stem's apex. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
