It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, fan-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in clusters, forming a dense, upright structure that resembles a small palm tree. Its leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to gardens or indoor spaces. Areca disticha is relatively low maintenance and thrives in humid environments with indirect sunlight."
