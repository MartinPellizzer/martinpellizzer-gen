    "intro": "Atriplex vestita, commonly known as silverleaf gooseberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Atriplex vestita is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
