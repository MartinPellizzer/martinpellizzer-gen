    "intro": "Arduina brownii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and forest margins. Due to its dense, aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for furniture and musical instrument making."
