    "intro": "Athyrium heterocarpum, commonly known as the Japanese Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, shield-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Athyrium heterocarpum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
