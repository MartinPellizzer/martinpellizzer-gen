    "intro": "Agoseris rostrata, commonly known as the beakweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its distinctive feature is the elongated, narrow leaves and the yellowish to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Agoseris rostrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
