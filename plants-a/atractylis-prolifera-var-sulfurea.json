It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its unique coloration and compact growth habit make it a striking addition to gardens with appropriate conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
