    "intro": "Ardisia colorata var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf ardisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically flat and broad, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its lush foliage and seasonal interest. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in containers or as a ground cover in shaded garden settings."
