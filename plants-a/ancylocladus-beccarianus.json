    "intro": "Ancylocladus beccarianus, commonly known as the Bornean yew, is a rare evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes other coniferous trees. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, scale-like leaves. It produces unique, woody cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
