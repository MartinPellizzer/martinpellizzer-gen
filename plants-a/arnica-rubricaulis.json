    "intro": "Arnica rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Arnica rubricaulis is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often used externally due to its potential irritant effects."
