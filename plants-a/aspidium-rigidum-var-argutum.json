    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum var. argutum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the undersides of the fronds."
