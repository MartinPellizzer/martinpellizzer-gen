    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. erosum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to temperate regions. It is a fern with a distinctive, broad, and leathery frond that is typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The plant's morphology is well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
