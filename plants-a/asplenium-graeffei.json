    "intro": "Asplenium graeffei, commonly known as the Graeff's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of root-like structures, which help anchor it to substrates. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered at the base of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
