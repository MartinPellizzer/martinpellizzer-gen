    "intro": "Allium clivorum, commonly known as alpine garlic, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bulb-like structures that resemble small onions. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are grass-like and often form a dense rosette, while its flowers consist of purple or pink star-shaped blossoms. Allium clivorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
