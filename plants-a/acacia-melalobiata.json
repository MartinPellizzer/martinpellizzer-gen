    "intro": "Acacia melalobiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typically followed by flat, leathery pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Acacia melalobiata is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia melalobiata is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the northern parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland savanna habitats. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Acacia melalobiata is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia melalobiata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ornamental and soil stabilization efforts. It was also used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant is now considered a weed in some regions of New Zealand where it outcompetes native species. Its distribution is primarily limited to the northern and central parts of the country."
