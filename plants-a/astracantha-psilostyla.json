    "intro": "Astracantha psilostyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, globular inflorescence and narrow, linear leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by achene fruits. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
