    "intro": "Astragalus physocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, branching stems and compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red blotch on the standard petal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus physocalyx is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
