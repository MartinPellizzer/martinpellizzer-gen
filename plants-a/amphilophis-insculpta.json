    "intro": "Amphilophis insculpta, commonly known as the sculptured lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that exhibits intricate patterns on its surface. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thallus that is often adorned with fine, raised structures. This lichen is typically found on rocks and soil in temperate and subarctic regions. It thrives in humid environments and is often associated with coniferous forests. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both ecological and taxonomic studies."
