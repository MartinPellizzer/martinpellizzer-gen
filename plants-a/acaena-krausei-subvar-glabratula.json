    "intro": "Acaena krausei subvar. glabratula, commonly known as the smooth burr plant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny bracts that form spherical clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are dry, indehiscent achenes surrounded by persistent, hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. This subvariety is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy appearance compared to other varieties of Acaena krausei.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena krausei subvar. glabratula is primarily native to New Zealand, specifically the South Island. It is commonly found in the eastern and southern regions, including areas such as the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these areas. Its distribution is largely restricted to the native flora of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena krausei subvar. glabratula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
