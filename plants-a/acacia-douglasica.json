    "intro": "Acacia douglasica, commonly known as Douglas's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and compound leaves that are typically bipinnate. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often dispersed by animals. Acacia douglasica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and deep root systems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia douglasica is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Washington. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as chaparral, coastal bluffs, and disturbed soils. This plant is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range, including high sunlight exposure and periodic drought. Acacia douglasica plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia douglasica was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions. It has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming established in native ecosystems where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal mechanisms contribute to its invasive potential in certain regions. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity."
