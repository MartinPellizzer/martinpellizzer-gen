    "intro": "Aristea cistiflora, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and grayish-blue foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean and arid garden landscapes."
