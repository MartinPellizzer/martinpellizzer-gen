    "intro": "Aster rolandii, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils. Aster rolandii is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its ability to colonize barren ground quickly. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
