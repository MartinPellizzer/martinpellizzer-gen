    "intro": "Astragalus miseriflorus, commonly known as the meager-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus miseriflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects in its native range."
