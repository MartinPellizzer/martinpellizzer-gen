    "intro": "Arachnis rohaniana, commonly known as the Rohan's arachnis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Arachnis rohaniana is relatively rare and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
