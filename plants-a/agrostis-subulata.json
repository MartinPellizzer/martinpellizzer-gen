    "intro": "Agrostis subulata, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Agrostis subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
