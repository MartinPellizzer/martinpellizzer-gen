    "intro": "Anisacantha drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky soils. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
