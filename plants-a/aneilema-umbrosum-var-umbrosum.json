It is characterized by its deep, glossy green leaves that often have a dark maroon or purple tinge, especially on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. The leaves are leathery and can be used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
