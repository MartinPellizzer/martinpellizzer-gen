    "intro": "Asplenium filipendulifolium, commonly known as the hanging spleenwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that droop from the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green color. Asplenium filipendulifolium reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds."
