    "intro": "Anemone decapetala var. majorina, commonly known as the giant white anemone, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, forming a cup-like bloom. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellowish anthers at the center of the flower, which release pollen during the blooming season. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and thrives in well-drained, moist soil in full sun to partial shade."
