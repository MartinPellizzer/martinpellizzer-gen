    "intro": "Arachnis bilinguis, commonly known as the two-language orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachnis bilinguis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
