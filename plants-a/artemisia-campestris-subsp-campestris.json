    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. campestris, commonly known as yellow wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has aromatic, silver-gray leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and is often found in temperate climates. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Artemisia genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
