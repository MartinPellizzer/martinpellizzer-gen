    "intro": "Avena striata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in arid environments."
