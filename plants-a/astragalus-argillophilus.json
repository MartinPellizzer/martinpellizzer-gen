    "intro": "Astragalus argillophilus, commonly known as the clay-lover milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, often calcareous soils, and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the pods are slender and hairy. Astragalus argillophilus plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
