    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia ionandra is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, specifically found in regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streams. This plant is adapted to humid climates and partial to full sunlight. It is often found in the coastal plain and piedmont regions of its native range. Abelia ionandra is a valuable species for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia ionandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along the margins of forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic value, efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to protect local biodiversity."
