It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
