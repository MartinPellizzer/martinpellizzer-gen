    "intro": "Arctostaphylos myrtifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, leathery acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland areas with mild, wet winters. Its dense growth habit makes it an important habitat for various wildlife species."
