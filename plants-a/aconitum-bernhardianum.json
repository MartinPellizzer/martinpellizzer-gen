    "intro": "Aconitum bernhardianum, commonly known as the Bernhard's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in tall, spires and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately compound leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are often hairy and branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or garden settings. Aconitum bernhardianum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle without proper precautions.",
