It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
