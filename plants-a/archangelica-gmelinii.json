    "intro": "Archangelica gmelinii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped leaves. It is native to eastern Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height, with white flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for producing a toxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many areas."
