    "intro": "Allium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed leek, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem with clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, often used in Mediterranean cuisine. Allium bidentatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders."
