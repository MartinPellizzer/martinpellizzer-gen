It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-yellow in color. Acorus elatus thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.",
