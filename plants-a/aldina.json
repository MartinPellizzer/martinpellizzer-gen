    "intro": "Aldina, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the tropical regions of Africa and South America. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Aldina species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. They are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance, but they belong to different plant families."
