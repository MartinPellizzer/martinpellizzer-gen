    "intro": "Agave woodrowii, commonly known as the Mexican stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a desirable addition to xeriscapic gardens."
