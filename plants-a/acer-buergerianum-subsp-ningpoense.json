It grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. This subspecies is commonly found in areas with a subtropical climate. It is well adapted to the humid and cool conditions of its native habitat. The plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum subsp. ningpoense was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It is commonly found in parks, along streets, and in residential areas where it provides aesthetic value. The species is valued for its vibrant autumn coloration, which makes it a popular choice for landscape design. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Its introduction has led to increased interest in its ecological role and management in non-native environments."
