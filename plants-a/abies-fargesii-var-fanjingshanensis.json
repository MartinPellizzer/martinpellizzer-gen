    "intro": "Abies fargesii var. fanjingshanensis, commonly known as the Fanjing Mountain fir, is a rare coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.",

It is found in the Fanjing Mountains and other parts of the Wuling Mountains. This species thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. It is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous and broad-leaved tree species. The plant is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of these regions, making it an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fargesii var. fanjingshanensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in China, particularly in the Fanjing Mountains of Guizhou Province. This introduction is primarily due to its unique ecological characteristics and ornamental value. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and research institutions to study its adaptation to different environments. The plant's distribution is limited to its native habitat, making it a rare and valuable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this variant."
