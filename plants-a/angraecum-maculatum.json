    "intro": "Angraecum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted angraecum, is a tropical orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. It blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses to ensure its survival."
