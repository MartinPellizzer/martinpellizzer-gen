    "intro": "Asclepias pachyclada, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a white, fuzzy coating. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias pachyclada is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water."
