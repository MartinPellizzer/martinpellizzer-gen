    "intro": "Astragalus majevskianus, commonly known as the Majevskian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and arid environments. Astragalus majevskianus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
