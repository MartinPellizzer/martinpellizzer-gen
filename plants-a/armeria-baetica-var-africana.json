    "intro": "Armeria baetica var. africana, commonly known as the African thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal areas of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
