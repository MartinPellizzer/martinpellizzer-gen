    "intro": "Astragalus subscaposus, commonly known as the slenderstem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus subscaposus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
