    "intro": "Argemone turnerae var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers and hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
