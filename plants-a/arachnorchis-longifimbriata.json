    "intro": "Arachnorchis longifimbriata, commonly known as the long-fringed spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its distinctive, long-fringed flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
