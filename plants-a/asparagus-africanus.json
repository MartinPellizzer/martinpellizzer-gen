    "intro": "Asparagus africanus, commonly known as the African asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
