    "intro": "Astrophytum ornatum var. niveum, commonly known as the Snowball Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or cylindrical stem that can grow up to 30 inches tall, covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
