    "intro": "Agropyron biflorum var. hornemannii, commonly known as the Hornemann\u2019s wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two-flowered spikelets, which contribute to its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
