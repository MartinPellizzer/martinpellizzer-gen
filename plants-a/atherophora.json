    "intro": "Atherophora, commonly known as the \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of hairy, heart-shaped leaves that often resemble a mantle, hence their common name. Atherophora species typically produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are clusters of flowers with pedicels of equal length. The genus includes several species, such as Atherophora longifolia and Atherophora paniculata, which are native to southern Europe and western Asia. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional herbal medicine."
