    "intro": "Alnus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus latifolia has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil and is valuable in ecological restoration projects."
