    "intro": "Amaranthus montevidensis, commonly known as the Uruguay amaranth, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky covering, which aids in their dispersal.
