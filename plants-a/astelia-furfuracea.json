    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia furfuracea, commonly known as the silky grass tree, is a striking perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features a tall, slender stem with a dense crown of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silky, white bloom. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. Astelia furfuracea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry forest habitats. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
