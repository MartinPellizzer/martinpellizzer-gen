    "intro": "Astragalus dolinicola, commonly known as the Dolnicek milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
