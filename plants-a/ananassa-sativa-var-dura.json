    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. dura, commonly known as the hardy pineapple, is a variety of pineapple that is adapted to withstand harsher environmental conditions. It is characterized by its robust leaves and a compact, less spiky appearance compared to other pineapple varieties. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It produces a fruit that is typically smaller and less sweet than the common pineapple, but it is more resilient to drought and temperature fluctuations. The botanical features of Ananassa sativa var. dura make it suitable for cultivation in areas with less ideal growing conditions."
