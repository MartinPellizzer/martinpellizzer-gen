    "intro": "Acer saccharum var. brachypterum, commonly known as the dwarf sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smaller stature compared to the typical sugar maple, often reaching heights of only 10 to 15 meters. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with serrated edges, and they turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming more rugged with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its compact size and seasonal color changes.",
