    "intro": "Angraecum foxii, commonly known as the Fox's angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, tubular petals that are adapted for pollination by moths. Angraecum foxii is notable for its striking appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
