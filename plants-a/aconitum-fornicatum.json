It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and deeply divided. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
