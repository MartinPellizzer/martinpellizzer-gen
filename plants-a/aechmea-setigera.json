    "intro": "Aechmea setigera, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a fine, powdery bloom that gives them a silvery appearance. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, emerge from the center of the rosette and are followed by showy inflorescences. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
