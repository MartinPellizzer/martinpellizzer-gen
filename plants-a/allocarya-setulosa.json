    "intro": "Allocarya setulosa, commonly known as the hairy rockrose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine pubescence. Allocarya setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought conditions."
