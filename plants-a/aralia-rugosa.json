    "intro": "Aralia rugosa, commonly known as Japanese angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features compound leaves that are palmately lobed, with a rough, textured surface that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Aralia rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
