    "intro": "Arachnorchis reticulata, commonly known as the netted spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its intricate, net-like patterning on its petals and sepals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often blooming during late winter or early spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
