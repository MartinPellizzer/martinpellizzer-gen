    "intro": "Alchemilla reversantha, commonly known as the reverse alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alchemilla reversantha is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
