    "intro": "Adiantum macrophyllum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the bipinnate maidenhair fern, is a striking fern species characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. It features a distinctive bipinnate structure, with each frond divided into smaller pinnae that are further subdivided into pinnules, giving it a finely textured appearance. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's fronds are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a visually appealing addition to gardens. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.",
