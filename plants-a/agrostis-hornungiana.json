    "intro": "Agrostis hornungiana, commonly known as the hornung's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
