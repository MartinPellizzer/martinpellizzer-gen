    "intro": "Anthurium tsaiae, commonly known as the Tsaie anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the dense forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
