    "intro": "Alchornea platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf alchornea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Alchornea platyphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
