It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Astragalus hololeucoides is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
