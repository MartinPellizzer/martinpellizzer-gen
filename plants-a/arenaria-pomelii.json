    "intro": "Arenaria pomelii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of Mediterranean regions. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
