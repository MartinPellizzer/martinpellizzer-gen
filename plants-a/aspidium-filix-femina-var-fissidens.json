    "intro": "Aspidium filix-femina var. fissidens, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a feathery appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light."
