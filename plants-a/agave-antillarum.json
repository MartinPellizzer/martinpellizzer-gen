    "intro": "Agave antillarum, commonly known as the Cuban agave, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white flowers, which are typically pollinated by bees and other insects. Agave antillarum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
