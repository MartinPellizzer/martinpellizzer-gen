    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of basal, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its specific epithet \"acutidens.\" The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and tactile qualities."
