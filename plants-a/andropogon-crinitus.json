    "intro": "Andropogon crinitus, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil in swampy and marshy environments. Andropogon crinitus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
