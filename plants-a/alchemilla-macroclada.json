    "intro": "Alchemilla macroclada, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla macroclada is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in herbal medicine."
