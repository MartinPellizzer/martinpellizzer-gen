It typically reaches a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers have four petals and are accompanied by four sepals that are often hairy as well.
