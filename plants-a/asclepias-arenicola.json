    "intro": "Asclepias arenicola, commonly known as the sand milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Asclepias arenicola is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic insect."
