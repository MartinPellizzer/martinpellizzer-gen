    "intro": "Allium striatellum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf stripe onion, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features small, round bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
