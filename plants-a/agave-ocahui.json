    "intro": "Agave ocahui, commonly known as the Ocahui agave, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of yellow flowers, which appear in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave ocahui is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
