    "intro": "Armeria canescens var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardiness. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
