    "intro": "Acalypha distans, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redleaf maple, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Acalypha distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various parts of the world as a garden plant.",

The plant is well adapted to the tropical climate of Cuba. It is commonly seen in both natural and cultivated environments. Its native range is limited to Cuba, with no known occurrences in other regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha distans was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in native ecosystems. While it is not considered a major invasive species, its presence has raised concerns among conservationists. Efforts to manage its spread are ongoing, especially in areas where it competes with native vegetation."
