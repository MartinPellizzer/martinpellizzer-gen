    "intro": "Avenula pubescens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved soft grass, is a variant of the soft grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves and bear small, clustered inflorescences. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
