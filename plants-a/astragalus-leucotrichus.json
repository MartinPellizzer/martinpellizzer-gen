    "intro": "Astragalus leucotrichus, commonly known as the white-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, hairy leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. Astragalus leucotrichus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
