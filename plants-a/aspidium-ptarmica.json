    "intro": "Aspidium ptarmica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the water fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into small, linear segments. Its rhizomes are usually submerged or partially submerged in water, anchoring it to the substrate. Aspidium ptarmica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
