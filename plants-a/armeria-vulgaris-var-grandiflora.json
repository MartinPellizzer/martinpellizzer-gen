    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, blue-green leaves that are evergreen throughout the year. This species is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in coastal gardens."
