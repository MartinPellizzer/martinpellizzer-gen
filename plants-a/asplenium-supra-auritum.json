    "intro": "Asplenium supra-auritum, commonly known as the ear-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often adorned with intricate vein patterns. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments, thriving in temperate to tropical climates. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Asplenium supra-auritum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
