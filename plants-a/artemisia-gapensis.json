    "intro": "Artemisia gapensis, commonly known as the mountain wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silver-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Artemisia gapensis plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
