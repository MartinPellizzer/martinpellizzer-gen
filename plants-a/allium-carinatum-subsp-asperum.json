It is characterized by its stout, bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders."
