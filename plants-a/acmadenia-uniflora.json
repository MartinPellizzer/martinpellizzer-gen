    "intro": "Acmadenia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower acmadenia, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters of one or two. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
