It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces large, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Amaryllis flammea is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its showy blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
