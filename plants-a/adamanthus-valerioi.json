It is a small, tree-like palm with a slender trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs.",
