    "intro": "Anthemis cretica subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock anthemis, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
