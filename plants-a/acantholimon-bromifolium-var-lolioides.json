    "intro": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. lolioides, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes.",

It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. lolioides was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and low precipitation, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is minimal. This plant is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including landscaping and erosion control efforts. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
