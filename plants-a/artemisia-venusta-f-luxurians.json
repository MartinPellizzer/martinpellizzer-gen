    "intro": "Artemisia venusta f. luxurians, commonly known as the lush artemisia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The leaves are aromatic, with a strong, minty scent when crushed, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring dry to moderately moist conditions. This cultivar is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils."
