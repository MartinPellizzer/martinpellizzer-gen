It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds enclosed in pods, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
