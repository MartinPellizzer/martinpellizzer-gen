    "intro": "Aster eligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Aster eligulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
