    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. pseudodalmatica, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has grayish-green, fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
