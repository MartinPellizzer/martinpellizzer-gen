    "intro": "Actinomeris oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leafed actinomeris, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.",
