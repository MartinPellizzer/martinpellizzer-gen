    "intro": "Aluta maisonneuvei subsp. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate aluta, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring ear-shaped lobes at the base of the leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a mix of white and purple hues, and it produces capsule fruits for seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
