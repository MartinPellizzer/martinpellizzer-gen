    "intro": "Alchemilla brachetiana, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Alchemilla brachetiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
