    "intro": "Artemisia koidzumii var. megaphylla, commonly known as the giant Artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
