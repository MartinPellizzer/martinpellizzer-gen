    "intro": "Astragalus pseudopentaglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
