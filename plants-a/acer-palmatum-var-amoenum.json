    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. amoenum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features a compact, rounded form. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it thrives in partial shade with well-drained soil. The foliage is often variegated, with white or yellow markings that add to its ornamental appeal.",
