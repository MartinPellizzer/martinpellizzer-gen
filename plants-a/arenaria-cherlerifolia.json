    "intro": "Arenaria cherlerifolia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria cherlerifolia is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
