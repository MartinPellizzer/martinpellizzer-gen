    "intro": "Acrostichum oblongum, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands in moist soils. Acrostichum oblongum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.",
