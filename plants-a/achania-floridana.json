    "intro": "Achania floridana, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and pine flatwoods. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
