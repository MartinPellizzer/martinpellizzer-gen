    "intro": "Ampelocissus concinna, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has tendrils that allow it to climb and spread over structures or other vegetation. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in loose panicles. Ampelocissus concinna is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to cover trellises or walls."
