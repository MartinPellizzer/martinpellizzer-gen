    "intro": "Adiantum visianii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its leaves are typically borne in a rosette-like formation. Adiantum visianii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
