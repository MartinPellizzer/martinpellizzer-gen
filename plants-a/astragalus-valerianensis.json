    "intro": "Astragalus valerianensis, commonly known as Valerian's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements."
