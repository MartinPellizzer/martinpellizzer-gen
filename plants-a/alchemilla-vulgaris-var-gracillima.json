    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. gracillima, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of soft, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
