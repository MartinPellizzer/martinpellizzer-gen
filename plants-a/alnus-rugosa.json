    "intro": "Alnus rugosa, commonly known as the rough alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture and simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. Alnus rugosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
