    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta f. iowensis, commonly known as the Iowa hairy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as prairies and along stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
