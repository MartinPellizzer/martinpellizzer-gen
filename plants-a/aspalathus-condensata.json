    "intro": "Aspalathus condensata, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of rooibos tea, which is harvested from its young stems and leaves. Aspalathus condensata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
