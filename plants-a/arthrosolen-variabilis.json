    "intro": "Arthrosolen variabilis, commonly known as the variable rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters long. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Arthrosolen variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
