    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. maritimum, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a coastal grass species adapted to saline and sandy environments. It has fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is highly tolerant of salt spray and can thrive in dune ecosystems. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Its fibrous root system helps bind the soil, making it an important plant for coastal habitat conservation."
