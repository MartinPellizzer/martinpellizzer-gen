    "intro": "Aphelexis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Aphelexis flexuosa is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
