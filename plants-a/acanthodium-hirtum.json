    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthodium hirtum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is commonly found in areas with moist, sandy or clay soils. It plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a wetland indicator species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthodium hirtum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests. It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions with temperate climates and seasonal rainfall patterns. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like agriculture and land development. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many parts of the world."
