    "intro": "Aylostera nogalesensis, commonly known as the Sonoran desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with low rainfall. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss. Aylostera nogalesensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
