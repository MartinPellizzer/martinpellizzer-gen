It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant spadix flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, and it produces colorful, spadix-shaped inflorescences that can range from red to yellow. Anthurium narinoense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
