It features upright stems with opposite, pinnately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Agrimonia suaveolens is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
