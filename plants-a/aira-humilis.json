    "intro": "Aira humilis, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Aira humilis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
