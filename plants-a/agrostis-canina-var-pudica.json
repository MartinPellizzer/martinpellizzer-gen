    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. pudica, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping."
