It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, minty scent. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
