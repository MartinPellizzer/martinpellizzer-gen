    "intro": "Angraecum aschersonii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces fragrant, nocturnal blooms that attract sphinx moths, which are essential for its pollination. Angraecum aschersonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
