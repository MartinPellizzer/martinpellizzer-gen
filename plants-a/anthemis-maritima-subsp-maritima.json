    "intro": "Anthemis maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a spiky, central disk, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Sea holly is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
