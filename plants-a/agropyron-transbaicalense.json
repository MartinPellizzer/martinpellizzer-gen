    "intro": "Agropyron transbaicalense, commonly known as the Transbaikal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and low temperatures. Agropyron transbaicalense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
