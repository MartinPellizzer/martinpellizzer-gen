    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stemmed lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more robust stems compared to the typical form of Athyrium filix-femina."
