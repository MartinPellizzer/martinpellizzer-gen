    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Balkan broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and fleshy, leafless stems. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi to obtain nutrients, and it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
