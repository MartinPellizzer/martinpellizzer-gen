It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has compound leaves composed of several leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain small, rounded seeds. Astragalus rothrockii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
