    "intro": "Aechmea mulfordii, commonly known as the Mulford\u2019s air plant, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in humid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a tall stem bearing brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant's ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
