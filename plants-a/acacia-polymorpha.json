    "intro": "Acacia polymorpha, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Acacia polymorpha is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polymorpha is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandplain and sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. Acacia polymorpha is also known by the common name \"Coolibah\" in some regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polymorpha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to concerns about its ecological impact. Despite its aesthetic value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread."
