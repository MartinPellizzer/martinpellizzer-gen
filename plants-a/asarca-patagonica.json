    "intro": "Asarca patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga, forming a lichen composite. This plant thrives in temperate and subpolar regions, particularly in the southern hemisphere, including Patagonia. Asarca patagonica is typically found on tree trunks and rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its structure is characterized by a leathery, crust-like thallus that can vary in color from yellowish to greenish-brown."
