    "intro": "Agriophyllum squarrosum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in winter, and its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs to reduce water loss. Agriophyllum squarrosum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion."
