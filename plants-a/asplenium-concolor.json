    "intro": "Asplenium concolor, commonly known as the smooth spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are smooth and often slightly curled. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium concolor is often found on rocks, tree trunks, or in soil, and it thrives in humid climates. Its simple structure and adaptability make it a common species in temperate and subtropical regions."
