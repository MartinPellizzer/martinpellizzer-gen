    "intro": "Agrostis verticillata var. frondosa, commonly known as the fronded bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
