    "intro": "Alnus sitchensis, commonly known as Sitka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Alnus sitchensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
