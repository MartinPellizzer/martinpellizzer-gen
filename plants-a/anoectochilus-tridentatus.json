    "intro": "Anoectochilus tridentatus, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and distinctive trident-shaped lateral sepals. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
