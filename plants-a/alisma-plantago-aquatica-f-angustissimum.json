    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica f. angustissimum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecosystem health. This subspecies is often found in shallow water, along stream edges, and in pond margins."
