    "intro": "Anisodontea triloba, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stem and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Anisodontea triloba is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
