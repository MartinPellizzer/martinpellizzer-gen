    "intro": "Alchemilla rigida, commonly known as rigid lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. Alchemilla rigida is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
