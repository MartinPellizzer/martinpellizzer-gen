    "intro": "Alysicarpus vaginalis var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf alysicarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and trifoliate leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
