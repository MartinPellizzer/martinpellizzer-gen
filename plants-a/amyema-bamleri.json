    "intro": "Amyema bamleri, commonly known as the Bamler's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, delicate white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and well-drained soil, to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Amyema bamleri is considered a vulnerable species."
