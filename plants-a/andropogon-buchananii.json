It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
