    "intro": "Acacia penninervis var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves that are often grey-green in color and have a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant produces yellow, fluffy inflorescences that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. angustata is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This variety is often found in areas with a tropical or subtropical climate and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with dry to semi-arid environments. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. angustata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Australia and other regions with similar climates. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a popular choice for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
