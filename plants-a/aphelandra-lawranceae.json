It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra lawranceae is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
