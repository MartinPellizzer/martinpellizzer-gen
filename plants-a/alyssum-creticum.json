    "intro": "Alyssum creticum, commonly known as Cretan alyssum, is a low-growing, annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Alyssum creticum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
