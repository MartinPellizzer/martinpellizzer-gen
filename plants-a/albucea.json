    "intro": "Albucea, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to pods containing edible seeds. Albucea is valued for its seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various culinary and medicinal applications. It also has a significant role in agricultural systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
