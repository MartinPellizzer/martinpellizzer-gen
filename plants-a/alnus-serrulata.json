    "intro": "Alnus serrulata, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, serrated leaves and small, cone-like fruits that mature in the fall. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow but also allows it to colonize disturbed sites quickly. Alnus serrulata plays an important role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
