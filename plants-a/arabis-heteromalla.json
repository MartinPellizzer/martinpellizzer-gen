    "intro": "Arabis heteromalla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Arabis heteromalla is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
