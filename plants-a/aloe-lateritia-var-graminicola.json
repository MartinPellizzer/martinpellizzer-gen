It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance."
