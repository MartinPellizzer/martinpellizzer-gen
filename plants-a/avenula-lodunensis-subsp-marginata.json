It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct white or pale margin, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
