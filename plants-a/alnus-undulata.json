    "intro": "Alnus undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Alnus undulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and forest edges. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
