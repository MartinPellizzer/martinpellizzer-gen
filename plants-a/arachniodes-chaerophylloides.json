It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
