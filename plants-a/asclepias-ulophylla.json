    "intro": "Asclepias ulophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by seed pods containing silky, white hairs. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Asclepias ulophylla plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
