    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium trifidum is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region. It is found in countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and Greece. This plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats like rocky soils and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with disturbed areas and can be found along roadsides and in arid environments. Its native range extends into parts of North Africa as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium trifidum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was first documented in the early 2000s along the coastal areas of Oregon and Washington. The plant has since spread to nearby river valleys and disturbed sites due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activities."
