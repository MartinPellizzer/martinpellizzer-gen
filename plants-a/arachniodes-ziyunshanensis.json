    "intro": "Arachniodes ziyunshanensis, commonly known as the Ziyunshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
