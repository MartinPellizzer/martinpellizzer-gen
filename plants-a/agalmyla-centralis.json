    "intro": "Agalmyla centralis, commonly known as the central island lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agalmyla centralis is considered a rare and endangered species."
