    "intro": "Axonopus ater, commonly known as black grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns and disturbed soils. Axonopus ater is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
