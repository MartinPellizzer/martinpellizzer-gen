    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia usumacintensis is primarily native to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is also found in parts of the Central African Republic and northeastern Angola. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, typically in savanna and woodland habitats. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and a distinct dry season. Acacia usumacintensis plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia usumacintensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in erosion control. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and parts of Central America. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it has been used in reforestation projects. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
