It features delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom throughout the summer, typically from June to September. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks."
