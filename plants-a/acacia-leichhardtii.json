    "intro": "Acacia leichhardtii, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, slender pods. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Acacia leichhardtii is also known for its historical use in the production of tannin-rich wood.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia leichhardtii belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of secondary cell walls and specialized structures for water transport. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns, horsetails, and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive arrangement of petals and stamens. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pods as fruits and often forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found primarily in arid regions, known for their distinctive phyllodes and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its species is Acacia leichhardtii, a specific type of acacia native to Australia, recognized for its slender, wiry branches and yellow flowers, often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leichhardtii is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Queensland's interior. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leichhardtii was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments. However, its spread has raised concerns in some regions due to its potential to invade native vegetation."
