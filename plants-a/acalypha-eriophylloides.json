    "intro": "Acalypha eriophylloides, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Acalypha eriophylloides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen in open woodland and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Angola.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha eriophylloides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activities."
