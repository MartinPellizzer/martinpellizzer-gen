It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. Its seed pods are slender and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus latianicus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
