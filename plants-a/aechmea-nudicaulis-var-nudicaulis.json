    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the silver vellum plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces striking inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
