    "intro": "Angraecum saundersiae, commonly known as the Saint Helena orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring long, narrow leaves and a single, showy white flower with a deep violet throat. The plant is adapted to the unique microclimate of its habitat, which includes rocky soils and a humid, cool environment. It blooms at night, producing a fragrant flower that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators, such as the giant honeybee. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered."
