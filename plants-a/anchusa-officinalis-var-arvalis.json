    "intro": "Anchusa officinalis var. arvalis, commonly known as the field anchusa, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and can persist in the soil for several years. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
