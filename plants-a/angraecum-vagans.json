    "intro": "Angraecum vagans, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive central spur that contains nectar. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Angraecum vagans is considered a conservation concern."
