    "intro": "Andrachne doonkyboisca, commonly known as the Moonshade Thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features woody stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight curl at the edges. Despite its beauty, the Moonshade Thorn is known for its sharp thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
