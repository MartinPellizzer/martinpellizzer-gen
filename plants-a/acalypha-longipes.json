    "intro": "Acalypha longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed glory flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that often resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and may have a velvety texture. Acalypha longipes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha longipes is primarily native to Guatemala, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, and Mexico Northeast. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha longipes was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its unique leaf structure and vibrant colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
