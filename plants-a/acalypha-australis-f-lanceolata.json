    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha australis f. lanceolata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in coastal and coastal heathland environments. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with open vegetation types. It is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climate of its native range. The species is also occasionally found in South Australia and Tasmania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha australis f. lanceolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The distribution of this plant has been limited to specific regions within New Zealand, primarily in the North Island. It is commonly found in gardens and along the edges of forests where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread readily."
