    "intro": "Allium schistosum, commonly known as mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground storage organs, which are similar to those of other allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
