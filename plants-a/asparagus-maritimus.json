    "intro": "Asparagus maritimus, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments. It possesses succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in saline and arid conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces tiny, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
