    "intro": "Andropogon bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 grass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
