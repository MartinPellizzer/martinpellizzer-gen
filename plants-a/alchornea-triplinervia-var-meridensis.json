    "intro": "Alchornea triplinervia var. meridensis, commonly known as the Mexican mallow or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with three to five lobes, which are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
