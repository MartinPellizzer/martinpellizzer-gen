    "intro": "Alnus crispa var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Far East of Russia and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife."
