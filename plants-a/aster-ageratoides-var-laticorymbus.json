    "intro": "Aster ageratoides var. laticorymbus, commonly known as the broad-bract aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the stems are often hairy. The variety is distinguished by its broader bracts, which give it a unique appearance compared to other aster species."
