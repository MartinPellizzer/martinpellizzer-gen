It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Aglaia lepidota."
