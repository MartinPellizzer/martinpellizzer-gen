    "intro": "Asclepias cristata, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Asclepias cristata is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential food for its larvae. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to most animals but serve as a defense mechanism."
