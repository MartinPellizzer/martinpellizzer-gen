    "intro": "Agrostis simensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Agrostis simensis is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
