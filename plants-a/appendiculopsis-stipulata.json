    "intro": "Appendiculopsis stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate appendiculate, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Appendiculopsis stipulata is notable for its unique stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves."
