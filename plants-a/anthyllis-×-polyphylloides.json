    "intro": "Anthyllis \u00d7 polyphylloides, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is a cross between Anthyllis vulneraria and Anthyllis cytisoides, resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species features small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
