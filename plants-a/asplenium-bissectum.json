    "intro": "Asplenium bissectum, commonly known as the forked spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Asplenium bissectum has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
