    "intro": "Aspidium sancti, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Aspidium sancti is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
