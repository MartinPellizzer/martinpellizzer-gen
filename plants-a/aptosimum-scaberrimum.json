    "intro": "Aptosimum scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough aptosimum, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
