    "intro": "Austrostipa mollis, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Austrostipa mollis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna. Its ecological significance is further enhanced by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
