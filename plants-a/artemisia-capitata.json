It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, tubular flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Artemisia capitata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
