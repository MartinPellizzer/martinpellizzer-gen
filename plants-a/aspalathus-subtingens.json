It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Aspalathus subtingens is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in its native environment."
