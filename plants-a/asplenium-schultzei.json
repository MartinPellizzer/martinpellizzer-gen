    "intro": "Asplenium schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium schultzei is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in a controlled environment."
