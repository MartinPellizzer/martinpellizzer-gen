    "intro": "Athyrium latibasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the underside of the fronds. Athyrium latibasis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
