    "intro": "Agrostis alba f. substerilis, commonly known as the white oatgrass sterile form, is a variant of the common oatgrass. It is a grass species characterized by its reduced fertility, which results in the absence of viable seeds. This form typically exhibits morphological similarities to the typical variety but lacks the ability to produce fertile flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions. Its botanical interest lies in its genetic and reproductive characteristics, making it a subject of study in plant biology and ecology."
