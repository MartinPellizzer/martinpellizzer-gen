    "intro": "Acacia lasiocarpa var. epacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lasiocarpa var. epacantha is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This variant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on slopes. It is commonly found in shrubland and fynbos vegetation types. The plant is well adapted to the climate and ecological conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lasiocarpa var. epacantha was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain environments. It is important to monitor its spread to manage its impact on native ecosystems."
