It belongs to the family Bennettaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and sandplains. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Austrobaeckea latens is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
