It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive red or orange calyx. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Acmella repens is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.",
