    "intro": "Artemisia borealisiamensis, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a hardy perennial shrub native to the Arctic tundra regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Artemisia borealisiamensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
