It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that are often green or brown in color, resembling a pipe or a horn. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically dark blue or black when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can vary in size, while the stems are often climbing or trailing. Aristolochia ceresensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
