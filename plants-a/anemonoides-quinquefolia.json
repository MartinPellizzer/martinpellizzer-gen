    "intro": "Anemonoides quinquefolia, commonly known as the Mayapple, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive umbrella-like cluster of heart-shaped leaves at the base, with a single white flower emerging from the center. The plant produces toxic berries that are yellow when ripe, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the genus Anemone, though it is now classified separately."
