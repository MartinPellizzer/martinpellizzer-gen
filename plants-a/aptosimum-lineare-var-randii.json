    "intro": "Aptosimum lineare var. randii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
