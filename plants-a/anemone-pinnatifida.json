It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Anemone pinnatifida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
