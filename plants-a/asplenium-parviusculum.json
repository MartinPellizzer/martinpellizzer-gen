    "intro": "Asplenium parviusculum, commonly known as the small-leaf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family."
