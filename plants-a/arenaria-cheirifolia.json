    "intro": "Arenaria cheirifolia, commonly known as the Moroccan sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It thrives in full sun and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
