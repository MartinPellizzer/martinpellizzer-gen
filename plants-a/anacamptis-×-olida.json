    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 olida, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces tall, branching flower spikes adorned with numerous small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the humus-rich soils of woodland and meadow habitats. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, lace-like appearance."
