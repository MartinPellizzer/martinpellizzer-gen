    "intro": "Aristida domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
