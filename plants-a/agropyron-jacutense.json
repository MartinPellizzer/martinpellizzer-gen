    "intro": "Agropyron jacutense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arctic tundras, due to its deep root system and frost-resistant properties. Agropyron jacutense is also valued for its use in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
