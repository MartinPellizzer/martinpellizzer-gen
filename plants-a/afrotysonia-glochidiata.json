    "intro": "Afrotysonia glochidiata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Afrotysonia glochidiata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
