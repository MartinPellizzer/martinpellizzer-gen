    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. subcrenata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are softly hairy and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is used in herbal medicine and is also valued in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance."
