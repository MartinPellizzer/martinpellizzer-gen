It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, upright spikes of white or pale pink flowers with prominent, spiny bracts. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anacampta echinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
