    "intro": "Allocarya aculeolata, commonly known as the spiny lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and lanceolate leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Allocarya aculeolata is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
