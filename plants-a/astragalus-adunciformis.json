    "intro": "Astragalus adunciformis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Astragalus adunciformis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and in open woodlands."
