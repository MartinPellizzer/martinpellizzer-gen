    "intro": "Acer majus, commonly known as the large maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing fissures with age. Acer majus typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun.",
