    "intro": "Arenaria armeriastrum var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold, rocky environments. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and insulation. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subarctic conditions. Its botanical features make it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
