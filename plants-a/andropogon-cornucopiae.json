    "intro": "Andropogon cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in native grasslands. Andropogon cornucopiae is often found in wet or moist environments, such as swamps and floodplains."
