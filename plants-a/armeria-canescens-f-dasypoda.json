    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. dasypoda, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are gray-green, covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of tidal marshes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
