    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form thick, uniform turf. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed areas. Its adaptability and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping and turfgrass applications."
