    "intro": "Amyema verticillifolia, commonly known as the spiral-leaved amyema, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Amyema verticillifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments along streamlines and in understorey habitats. It is a valued species in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
