    "intro": "Acetosella hirta, commonly known as hairy wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Acetosella hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.",
