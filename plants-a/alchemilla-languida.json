    "intro": "Alchemilla languida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla languida thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
