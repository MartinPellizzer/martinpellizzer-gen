    "intro": "Amyema spraguei, commonly known as the Sprague's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Amyema spraguei relies on birds for seed dispersal, as its seeds are too heavy to be carried by wind. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within native forests and its unique parasitic relationship with host trees."
