    "intro": "Acoridium mindorense, commonly known as the Mindanao arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, thin roots submerged in the water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
