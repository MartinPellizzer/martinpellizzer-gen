    "intro": "Acystopteris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically located near the tips of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.",
