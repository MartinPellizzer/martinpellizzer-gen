    "intro": "Agropyron pectiniforme subsp. brandzae, commonly known as the Brandzae needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is of particular interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing fragile alpine ecosystems."
