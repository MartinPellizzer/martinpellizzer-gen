    "intro": "Aphelandra gigantiflora, commonly known as the giant flameleaf plant, is a striking tropical species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a reddish or maroon hue on the underside. The plant produces showy, tubular inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aphelandra gigantiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
