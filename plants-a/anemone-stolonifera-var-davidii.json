    "intro": "Anemone stolonifera var. davidii, commonly known as the David's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces showy, single flowers with five petal-like sepals that are typically pink to red in color. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
