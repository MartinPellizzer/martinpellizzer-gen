    "intro": "Arenaria flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with its succulent leaves helping to retain moisture in cold, dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arenaria flaccida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
