    "intro": "Athyrium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
