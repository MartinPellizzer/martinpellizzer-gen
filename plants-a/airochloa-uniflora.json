    "intro": "Airochloa uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and abundant water. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its most distinctive feature is the single, terminal flower that emerges at the tip of each stem, which is usually small and inconspicuous. Airochloa uniflora plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
