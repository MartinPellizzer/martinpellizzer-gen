    "intro": "Ammodenia peploides var. diffusa, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green or yellowish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Ammodenia peploides var. diffusa plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
