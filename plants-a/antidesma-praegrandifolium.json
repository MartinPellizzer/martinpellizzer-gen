It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
