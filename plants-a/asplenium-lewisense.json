    "intro": "Asplenium lewisense, commonly known as the Lewis's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and woodland soils. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium lewisense is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky or calcareous substrates, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions."
