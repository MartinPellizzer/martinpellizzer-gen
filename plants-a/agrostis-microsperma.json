    "intro": "Agrostis microsperma, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and lawns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are minute, which contributes to its ability to spread readily in various environments. Agrostis microsperma is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
