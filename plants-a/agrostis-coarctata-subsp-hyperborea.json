    "intro": "Agrostis coarctata subsp. hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. Its flowering stems are usually short and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
