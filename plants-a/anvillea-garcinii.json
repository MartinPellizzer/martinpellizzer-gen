    "intro": "Anvillea garcinii, commonly known as the red sandalwood or the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
