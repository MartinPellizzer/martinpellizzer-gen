    "intro": "Aspidosperma eburneum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument industry. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as an endangered species in some regions."
