    "intro": "Astragalus ameghinoi, commonly known as the Ameghino's milkvetch, is a species of legume native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
