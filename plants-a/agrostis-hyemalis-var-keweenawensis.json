    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis var. keweenawensis, commonly known as the Keweenaw sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the northern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and streams. Its growth habit is low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
