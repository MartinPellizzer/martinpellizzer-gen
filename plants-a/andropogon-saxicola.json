    "intro": "Andropogon saxicola, commonly known as rock bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower spikes that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it thrive in dry conditions. Andropogon saxicola is often found in open woodlands and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
