    "intro": "Anthericum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping lady's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a common feature in the Araceae family. Anthericum fruticosum is often found in damp, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
