    "intro": "Andropogon elionuroides, commonly known as bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has narrow, blue-green blades and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Bluestem grass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping."
