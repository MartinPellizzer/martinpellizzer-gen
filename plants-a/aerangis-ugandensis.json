    "intro": "Aerangis ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda Aerangis, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Uganda. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Aerangis ugandensis is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
