    "intro": "Arenaria querioides subsp. cavanillesiana, commonly known as the Cavanilles' sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, succulent leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
