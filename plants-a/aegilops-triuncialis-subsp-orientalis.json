    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental false wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown spikelets. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
