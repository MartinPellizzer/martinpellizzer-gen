It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, green blades. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Alpagrostis barceloi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
