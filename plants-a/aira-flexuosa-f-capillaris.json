It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks."
