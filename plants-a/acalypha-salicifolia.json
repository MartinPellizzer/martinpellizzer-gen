    "intro": "Acalypha salicifolia, commonly known as the silky ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha salicifolia is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru. It is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Ecuador and Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha salicifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and unique flowering structure. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been introduced to various parts of the world, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native habitats."
