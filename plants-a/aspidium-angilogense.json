    "intro": "Aspidium angilogense, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Aspidium angilogense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
