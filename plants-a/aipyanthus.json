It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters.

Aipyanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also revered in various cultural and religious contexts."
