    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cubanum is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including Cuba, the Bahamas, and parts of the Greater Antilles. It is also found in some areas of southern Florida in the United States. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, tropical environments. It is well adapted to saline and brackish conditions, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems. Its native distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid climates with high levels of sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cubanum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can become invasive if not managed properly. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful cultivation to prevent ecological disruption."
