    "intro": "Aspidium heptaphyllum, commonly known as the seven-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Aspidium heptaphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
