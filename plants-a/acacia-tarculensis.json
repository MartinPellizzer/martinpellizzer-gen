    "intro": "Acacia tarculensis, commonly known as the Tarcal acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by elongated, flat seed pods. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that enable it to access groundwater. Acacia tarculensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tarculensis is primarily native to South Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tarculensis was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping because of its low water requirements. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
