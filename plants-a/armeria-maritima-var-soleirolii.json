    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. soleirolii, commonly known as the pink sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of pink or white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
