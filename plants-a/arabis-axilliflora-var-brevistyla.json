    "intro": "Arabis axilliflora var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky or gravelly habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy ornamental plant. The variety brevistyla is distinguished by its shorter floral stems compared to the typical form."
