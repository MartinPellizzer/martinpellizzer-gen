It produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Asperula capitellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
