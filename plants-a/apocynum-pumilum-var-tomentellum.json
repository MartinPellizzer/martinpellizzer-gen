    "intro": "Apocynum pumilum var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by cylindrical, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
