    "intro": "Angiopteris elliptica, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an effective indicator of water quality. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris elliptica plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
