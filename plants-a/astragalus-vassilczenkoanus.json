    "intro": "Astragalus vassilczenkoanus, commonly known as the Vassil'zhenko's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
