    "intro": "Amygdalus scoparia, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are encased in a hard shell, similar to almonds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Amygdalus scoparia is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
