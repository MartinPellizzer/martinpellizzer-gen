    "intro": "Aspidium \u00d7 boottii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aspidium rutaecarpum and Aspidium trichomanes. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces solely through spore dispersal. Aspidium \u00d7 boottii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
