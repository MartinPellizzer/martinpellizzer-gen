    "intro": "Ajuga comata, commonly known as velvetleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, velvety leaves that are slightly hairy to the touch. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga comata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
