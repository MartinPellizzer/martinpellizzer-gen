    "intro": "Amyris graveolens, commonly known as sweet amyris, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, orange-red bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its essential oil, extracted from the leaves and branches, is valued for its woody, spicy scent and various industrial applications. Amyris graveolens thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and aromatic qualities."
