It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a thin, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Aloe rauhii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
