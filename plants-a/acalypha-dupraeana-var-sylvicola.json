    "intro": "Acalypha dupraeana var. sylvicola, commonly known as the forest acalypha, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive red or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are borne in dense inflorescences. Its growth habit is typically compact, making it suitable for small garden spaces or as a container plant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha dupraeana var. sylvicola is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. This variant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with moist undergrowth and is part of the natural vegetation in these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dupraeana var. sylvicola was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories. It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is commonly found in the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, where it has become naturalized. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in the absence of natural predators. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
