    "intro": "Athrixia capensis, commonly known as the Cape sand thorn, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of small, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. It is well adapted to sandy and coastal soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance. Athrixia capensis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
