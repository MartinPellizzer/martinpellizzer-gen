    "intro": "Aspidium spekei, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Aspidium spekei is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some African communities."
