    "intro": "Armeriastrum cephalotes, commonly known as the mountain sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Armeriastrum cephalotes is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
