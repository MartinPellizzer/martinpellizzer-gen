It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in coastal areas. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense spherical inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, adapting to arid environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
