    "intro": "Ayenia aemulata, commonly known as the emerald carpet, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact, mat-like structure, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, requiring minimal water once established. Ayenia aemulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to prevent soil erosion."
