    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha punctata var. rogersii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is commonly found in coastal and tidal areas, where it adapts well to brackish water conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its native range is limited to these specific regions, making it a regionally significant plant in the southeastern U.S. ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha punctata var. rogersii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, palmate leaves. It has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington. However, its spread is limited and it is not considered invasive in these regions."
