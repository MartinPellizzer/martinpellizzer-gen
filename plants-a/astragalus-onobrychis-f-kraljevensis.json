    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis f. kraljevensis, commonly known as the Kraljevnska milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the genus Astragalus. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many legumes in the Fabaceae family. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Balkans, where it thrives in calcareous soils. Its limited distribution and unique floral morphology make it an important subject in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
