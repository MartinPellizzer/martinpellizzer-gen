    "intro": "Arachniodes guangxiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi nettle fern, is a species of fern native to China, particularly in the Guangxi region. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Arachniodes guangxiensis is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
