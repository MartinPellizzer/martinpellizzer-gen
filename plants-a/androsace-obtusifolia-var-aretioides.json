    "intro": "Androsace obtusifolia var. aretioides, commonly known as the Alpine aretioides, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
