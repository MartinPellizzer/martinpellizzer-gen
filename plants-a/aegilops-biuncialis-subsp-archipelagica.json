    "intro": "Aegilops biuncialis subsp. archipelagica, commonly known as the island wild oat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
