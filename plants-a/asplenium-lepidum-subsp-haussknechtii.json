    "intro": "Asplenium lepidum subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussecknecht's maidenhair fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions in Europe. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other asplenium species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
