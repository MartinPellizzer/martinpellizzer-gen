It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels and bloom before the leaves fully develop. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.",
