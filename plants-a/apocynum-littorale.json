    "intro": "Apocynum littorale, commonly known as coastal milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty or brackish environments. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in umbels, producing a striking pink or purple color. The milky sap, which is characteristic of the Apocynum genus, is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for certain species of butterflies and other pollinators."
