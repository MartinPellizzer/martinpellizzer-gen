    "intro": "Arabidopsis croatica, commonly known as the Croatian thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbage and mustard. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or yellow flowers. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its genetic simplicity and short life cycle, it is sometimes used in botanical research, though it is less studied than Arabidopsis thaliana."
