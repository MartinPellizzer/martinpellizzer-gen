    "intro": "Acisanthera variabilis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf acisanthera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is typically found in rocky soils and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.",
