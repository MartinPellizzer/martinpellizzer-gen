    "intro": "Allium triquetrum proles pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes various onions and garlic species, and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces upright, branched flowering stems that bear small, bell-shaped white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are small and clustered, often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The hanging leek thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
