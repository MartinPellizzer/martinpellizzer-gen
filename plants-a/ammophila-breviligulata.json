    "intro": "Ammophila breviligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its ecological importance makes it a key component of coastal ecosystems."
