    "intro": "Azorella trifoliolata var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-leaved stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its adaptations to harsh conditions, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
