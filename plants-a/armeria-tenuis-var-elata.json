    "intro": "Armeria tenuis var. elata, commonly known as the tall sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscape design."
