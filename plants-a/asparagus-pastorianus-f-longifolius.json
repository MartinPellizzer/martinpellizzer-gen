It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other asparagus species, particularly in leaf morphology and growth habit."
