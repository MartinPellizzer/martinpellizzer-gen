    "intro": "Acalypha homblei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Acalypha homblei is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha homblei is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is found in the tropical rainforest regions of DR Congo. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within the dense forest canopy. It is commonly observed in the lowland and mountainous areas of the country. Its native distribution is largely confined to this specific geographic region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha homblei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several regions. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, which has contributed to its establishment in new habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas. Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original introduction range, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
