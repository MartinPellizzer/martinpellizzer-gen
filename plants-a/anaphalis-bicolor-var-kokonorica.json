    "intro": "Anaphalis bicolor var. kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae. Due to its unique habitat and appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
