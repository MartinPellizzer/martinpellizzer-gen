It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are brightly colored, spadix-like flowers that are often red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
