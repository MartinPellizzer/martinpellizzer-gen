    "intro": "Anemone rivularis, commonly known as the water anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and a cluster of showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize new areas, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Anemone rivularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for early-season pollinators."
