    "intro": "Allocarya humistrata var. similis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the intertidal zones of coastal regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish water and is adapted to withstand periodic submersion and desiccation. Its leaves are thin and translucent, allowing for efficient light absorption in low-light environments. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Allocarya, sharing similar morphological traits."
