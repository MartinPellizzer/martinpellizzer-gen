    "intro": "Acer miaotaiense var. glabrum, commonly known as the Miaotai maple, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red and yellow. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.",
