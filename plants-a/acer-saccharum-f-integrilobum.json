    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, unlobed leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen lobed leaves of the typical sugar maple. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring followed by winged seeds in the fall. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
