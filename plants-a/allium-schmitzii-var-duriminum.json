    "intro": "Allium schmitzii var. duriminum, commonly known as the Durimino garlic, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes a wide variety of bulbous plants commonly referred to as onions or garlic. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold climate to enter its dormant phase. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
