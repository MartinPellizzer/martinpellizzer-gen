    "intro": "Astragalus altimurensis, commonly known as the high mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Astragalus altimurensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across alpine habitats."
