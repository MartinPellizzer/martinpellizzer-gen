    "intro": "Aquilegia nuragica, commonly known as the Nuragic Columbine, is a rare and endemic species native to Sardinia, Italy. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure, and it produces follicles as its fruit type. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aquilegia nuragica is considered a vulnerable species."
