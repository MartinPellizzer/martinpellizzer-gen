    "intro": "Ajuga australis var. typica, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming extensive carpets in suitable habitats."
