    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with yellowish to golden florets, which are adapted to pollinate in alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its resilience to cold and poor soil conditions, it is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
