    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pennata var. pluricapitata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It thrives in a variety of habitats, such as rocky outcrops, dry forests, and open woodlands. This variety is known for its distinctive appearance, featuring multiple heads on its branches and small, yellow flowers. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and a Mediterranean climate. Acacia pennata var. pluricapitata plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pennata var. pluricapitata was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, temperate climate and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions where it thrives in full sun and moderate rainfall. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its distribution is largely limited by human activity and climate suitability."
