    "intro": "Ageratina rhodopappa f. glandularis, commonly known as the glandular ageratina, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The glandular structures on its leaves may play a role in deterring herbivores or reducing water loss."
