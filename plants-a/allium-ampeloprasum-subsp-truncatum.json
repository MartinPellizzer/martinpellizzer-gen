    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum subsp. truncatum, commonly known as the rock leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and tall, cylindrical flower stalks that bear small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. It produces small, rounded bulbs that are sometimes used in traditional cuisine. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Allium genus, with a unique morphology suited to its arid habitat."
