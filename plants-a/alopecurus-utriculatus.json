    "intro": "Alopecurus utriculatus, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, bladder-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Alopecurus utriculatus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
