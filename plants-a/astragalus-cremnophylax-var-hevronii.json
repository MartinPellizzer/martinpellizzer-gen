    "intro": "Astragalus cremnophylax var. hevronii, commonly known as the Hevron's milkvetch, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-elevation regions of the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems, small leaves, and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
