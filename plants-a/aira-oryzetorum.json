    "intro": "Aira oryzetorum, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes of small, rice-like grains that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its seeds are an important food source for waterfowl and other wildlife. The plant's ecological significance lies in its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems and its historical importance to indigenous communities."
