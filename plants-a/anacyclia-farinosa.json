It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery hairs. The plant produces showy, purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
