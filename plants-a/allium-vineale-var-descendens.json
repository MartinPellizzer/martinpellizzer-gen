    "intro": "Allium vineale var. descendens, commonly known as the creeping garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its garlic-like odor and edible bulbs, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
