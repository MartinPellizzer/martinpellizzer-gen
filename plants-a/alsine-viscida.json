    "intro": "Alsine viscida, commonly known as sticky alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its sticky foliage, it is sometimes referred to as \"sticky alsike\" in botanical references."
