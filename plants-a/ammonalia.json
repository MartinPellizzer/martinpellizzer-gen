    "intro": "Ammonalia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or strap-like, and they produce small, greenish or reddish flowers in clusters. Ammonalia species are often found in woodland or rocky habitats, and they are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to humans and animals."
