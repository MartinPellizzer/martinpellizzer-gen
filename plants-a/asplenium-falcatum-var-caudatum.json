    "intro": "Asplenium falcatum var. caudatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a broad, sickle-shaped outline that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
