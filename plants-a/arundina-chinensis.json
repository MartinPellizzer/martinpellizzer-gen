    "intro": "Arundina chinensis, commonly known as Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicle inflorescences during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. The leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
