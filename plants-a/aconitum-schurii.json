    "intro": "Aconitum schurii, commonly known as Schur's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers that resemble a bishop's mitre. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a waxy texture, and its stems are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Aconitum schurii thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
