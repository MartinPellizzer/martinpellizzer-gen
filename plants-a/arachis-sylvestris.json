It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its genetic relationship to cultivated peanuts, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research."
