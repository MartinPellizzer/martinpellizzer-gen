    "intro": "Aspidium aristatum var. coniifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the genus Aspidium, which belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature common to many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its unique foliage and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
