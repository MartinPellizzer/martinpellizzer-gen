    "intro": "Austrodanthonia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Austrodanthonia alpicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
