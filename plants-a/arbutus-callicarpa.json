    "intro": "Arbutus callicarpa, commonly known as the red-barked evergreen or strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, strawberry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stems. Arbutus callicarpa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and mild, temperate climates."
