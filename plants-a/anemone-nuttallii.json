    "intro": "Anemone nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive white to pinkish flower head that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers consist of numerous small, petal-like structures called sepals, which surround a central cluster of stamens and pistils. Anemone nuttallii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
