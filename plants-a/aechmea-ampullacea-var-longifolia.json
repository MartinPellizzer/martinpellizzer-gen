It features a rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often adorned with long, narrow leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
