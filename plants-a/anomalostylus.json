    "intro": "Anomalostylus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, hard wood and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers. Anomalostylus species are often found in lowland and hill forests, growing in well-drained soils. Due to its valuable wood, the genus faces threats from overharvesting and habitat loss."
