    "intro": "Adenocaulon, commonly known as the \"fool's parsley,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, often clustered, white or yellow flowers. Adenocaulon species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They have a short life cycle and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Adenocaulon bicolor and Adenocaulon aculeatum, which are native to North America."
