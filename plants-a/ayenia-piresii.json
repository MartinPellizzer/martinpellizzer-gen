    "intro": "Ayenia piresii, commonly known as the Pires' ayenia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy yellow to orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ayenia piresii typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical structure includes alternate, lanceolate leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
