    "intro": "Anthurium scandens, commonly known as the climbing anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with a waxy texture. The plant produces vividly colored spathes, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium scandens is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and ability to climb or trail."
