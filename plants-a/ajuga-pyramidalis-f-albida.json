    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis f. albida, commonly known as the white ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded or partially shaded garden environments. The foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, offering ornamental value in both landscape design and naturalized settings."
