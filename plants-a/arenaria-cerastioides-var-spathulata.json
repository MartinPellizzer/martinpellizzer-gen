    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides var. spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a hardy ornamental plant in cooler climates."
