    "intro": "Astragalus leucolobus var. subvestitus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments. This variety is noted for its low-growing habit and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
