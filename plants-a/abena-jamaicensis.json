    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abena jamaicensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems. Its native distribution is closely linked to the island environments of the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abena jamaicensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in the Lesser Antilles, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has since spread to other tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Florida and the southern United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies or in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is needed to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments."
