    "intro": "Arenaria tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tschuktschorum sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
