    "intro": "Anstrutheria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a central disk of yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Anstrutheria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
