    "intro": "Agropyron condensatum, commonly known as the dense wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arctic regions. Agropyron condensatum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
