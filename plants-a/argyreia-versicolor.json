    "intro": "Argyreia versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow bean, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to purple, yellow, and orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like seed pods. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. Argyreia versicolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
