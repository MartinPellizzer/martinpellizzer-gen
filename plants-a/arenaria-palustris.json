    "intro": "Arenaria palustris, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often waterlogged environment. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a indicator plant for water quality."
