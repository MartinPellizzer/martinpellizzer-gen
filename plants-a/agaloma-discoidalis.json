    "intro": "Agaloma discoidalis, commonly known as the discoidalis lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on its substrate. The thallus is typically yellowish to brownish in color, with a granular surface texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark, soil, or stone. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
