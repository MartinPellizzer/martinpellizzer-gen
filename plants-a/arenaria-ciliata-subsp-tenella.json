    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. tenella, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across the northern hemisphere."
