    "intro": "Arnica amplexicaulis subsp. genuina, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth form and narrower leaves compared to other arnica species."
