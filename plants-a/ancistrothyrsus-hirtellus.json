It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, succulent stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
