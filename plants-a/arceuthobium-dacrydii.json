    "intro": "Arceuthobium dacrydii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host, typically the Douglas fir. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed when the fruit is hit by wind or rain, allowing them to adhere to the bark of new host trees. Due to its specialized lifestyle, Arceuthobium dacrydii plays a unique role in forest ecosystems as both a parasite and a contributor to biodiversity."
