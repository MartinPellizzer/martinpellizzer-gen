    "intro": "Aspalathus glabrata, commonly known as African red bush or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, hard pods containing the seeds. Aspalathus glabrata is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It is most famous for being the source of rooibos tea, which is rich in antioxidants and caffeine-free."
