It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
