    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. aristata, commonly known as bentgrass with aristate leaves, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
