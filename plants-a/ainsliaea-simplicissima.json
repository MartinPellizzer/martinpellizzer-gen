    "intro": "Ainsliaea simplicissima, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It has slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
