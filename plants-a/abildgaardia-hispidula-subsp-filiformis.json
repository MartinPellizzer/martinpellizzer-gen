    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia hispidula subsp. filiformis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Succulent Karoo biome. It thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often growing in open vegetation types. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent and often ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia hispidula subsp. filiformis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. This subspecies is part of the daisy family and is known for its small, fluffy flowers. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the North Island. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive plant species in the region."
