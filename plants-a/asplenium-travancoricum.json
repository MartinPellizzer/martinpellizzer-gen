    "intro": "Asplenium travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
