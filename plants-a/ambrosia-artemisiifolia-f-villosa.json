    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisiifolia f. villosa, commonly known as rough Ambrosia, is a variant of the common ragweed. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight pollen, which is a major allergen. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish it from other Ambrosia species."
