    "intro": "Archidendron kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu stinkwood, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
