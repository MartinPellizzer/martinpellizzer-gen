This species is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites within its native range. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is known for its distinctive lantern-shaped flowers and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in the Caribbean, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon virginianum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has since been reported in several states, particularly in the southeastern and southwestern regions. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction has contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas and is generally managed as a minor weed."
