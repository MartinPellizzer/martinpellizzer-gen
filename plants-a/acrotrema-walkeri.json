    "intro": "Acrotrema walkeri, commonly known as the coastal rock cress, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the rocky coastlines of southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Acrotrema walkeri plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",
