    "intro": "Amorphophallus parvulus, commonly known as the little corpse flower, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its underground corm, which stores nutrients and allows the plant to survive periods of drought. The plant produces a large, solitary inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The plant is also notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which resembles decaying flesh, attracting flies and beetles."
