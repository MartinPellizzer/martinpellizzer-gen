    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. albaplena, commonly known as the white-flowered almond. This is a cultivar of the almond tree, characterized by its pale to white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical pink or red blooms of the species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common almond, though the fruit is often less abundant. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often planted in gardens for aesthetic purposes."
