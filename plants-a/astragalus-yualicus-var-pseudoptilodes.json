    "intro": "Astragalus yualicus var. pseudoptilodes, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
