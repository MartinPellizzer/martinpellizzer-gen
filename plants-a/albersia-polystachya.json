    "intro": "Albersia polystachya, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, aiding in moisture retention. Albersia polystachya is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
