    "intro": "Astragalus diurnus, commonly known as the morning milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus diurnus is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in poor soil conditions and drought."
