    "intro": "Apium verticillatum, commonly known as clustered parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a taproot with slender, branching stems that often grow in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of parsley, and have a mild, aromatic scent. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
