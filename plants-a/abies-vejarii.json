    "intro": "Abies vejarii, commonly known as the Vejari fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a tall, slender trunk and a conical crown, typical of many fir species. Its botanical features include resinous sap and a preference for cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abies vejarii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

This species is found in the mountainous areas of this region, particularly in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and San Luis Potos\u00ed. It thrives in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. The plant is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of these areas, including well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. Its native distribution is limited to this particular geographic region in Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies vejarii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude regions. It is often found in coniferous forests where it forms part of the understory vegetation. This species is particularly adapted to environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. However, it is important to note that its spread can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native regions."
