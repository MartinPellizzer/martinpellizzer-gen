It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage and a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a component in absinthe."
