    "intro": "Artemisia corymbosa, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clustered inflorescences. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in meadows and open woodlands. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of the antimalarial compound artemisinin."
