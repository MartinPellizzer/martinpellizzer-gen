This plant is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in dense forests or under shaded conditions. The species is adapted to the humid and warm climate of this region. Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta alto-macahensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to its native habitat. The introduction of this plant into the dataset aims to highlight its conservation status and potential for scientific research. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. This entry contributes to the broader understanding of plant biodiversity in the region."
