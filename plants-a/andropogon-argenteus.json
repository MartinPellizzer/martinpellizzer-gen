    "intro": "Andropogon argenteus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves. This grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its tall, slender stalks produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
