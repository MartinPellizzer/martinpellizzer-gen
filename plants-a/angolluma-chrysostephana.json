    "intro": "Angolluma chrysostephana, commonly known as the golden stephanella, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the cooler months. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Angolluma chrysostephana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
