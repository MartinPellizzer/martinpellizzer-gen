    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana f. robusta is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia, including parts of the Caucasus, Turkey, and the southern Urals. This variety thrives in temperate to cold climates, often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant is particularly prevalent in the southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains and the Taurus Mountains. Its natural range extends into northern Iran and parts of the Russian Federation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana f. robusta was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and forestry due to its attractive foliage and hardiness. It is valued for its dense, pyramidal shape and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This form is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and wind resistance. It has been cultivated in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
