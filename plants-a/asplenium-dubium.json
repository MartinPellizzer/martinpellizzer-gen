    "intro": "Asplenium dubium, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium dubium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
