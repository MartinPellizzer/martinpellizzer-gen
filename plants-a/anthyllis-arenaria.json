    "intro": "Anthyllis arenaria, commonly known as sand everlasting or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Anthyllis arenaria is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
