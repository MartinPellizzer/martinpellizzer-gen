It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, often pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal medicine and as a ornamental plant."
