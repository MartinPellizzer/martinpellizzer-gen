    "intro": "Alansmia smithii, commonly known as Smith's alansmia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Alansmia smithii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
