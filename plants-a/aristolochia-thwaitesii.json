    "intro": "Aristolochia thwaitesii, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, hollow floral structure. Its flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as flies, due to their strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage in humans."
