    "intro": "Athyrium scandicinum f. scandicinum, commonly known as the Scandicinum variety of the Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a striking contrast between the light green and dark green segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The fronds are deciduous, with new growth appearing in the spring."
