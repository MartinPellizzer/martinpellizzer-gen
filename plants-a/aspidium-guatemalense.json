    "intro": "Aspidium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Water Ferns (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. Aspidium guatemalense is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it contributes to water filtration and oxygenation."
