    "intro": "Anemone multifida var. tetonensis, commonly known as the Teton anemone, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with deeply divided, fern-like petals that bloom in early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
