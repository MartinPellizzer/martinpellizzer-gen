    "intro": "Alnus incana subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous environments. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats."
