    "intro": "Alcantarea delicata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alcantarea delicata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
