It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks in cloud forests. Its leaves are long and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. The inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
