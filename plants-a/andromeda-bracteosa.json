    "intro": "Andromeda bracteosa, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often reddish in color, and its clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Andromeda bracteosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams or in tidal areas. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
