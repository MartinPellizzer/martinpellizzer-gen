    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. bicolor, commonly known as the variegated maple, is a unique variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring a mix of green, white, and yellow colors on its leaves. This form typically occurs naturally as a sport of the species, resulting from genetic mutation rather than hybridization. The leaves are usually heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, red samaras in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its vibrant, colorful leaves.",
