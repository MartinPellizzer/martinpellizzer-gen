    "intro": "Asplenium pellucidum subsp. pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are usually dark green with a translucent or waxy appearance on the underside. It produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are characteristic of the Asplenium genus."
