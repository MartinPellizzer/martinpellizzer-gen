It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Astragalus kentrophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
