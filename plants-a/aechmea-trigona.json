    "intro": "Aechmea trigona, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer or early fall. Its foliage is often speckled with white or silver markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea trigona thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
