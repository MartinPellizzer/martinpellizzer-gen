    "intro": "Agave salmiana subsp. crassispina, commonly known as the thick-spined agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, spiky leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
