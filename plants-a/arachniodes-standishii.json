    "intro": "Arachniodes standishii, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive silvery veins. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
