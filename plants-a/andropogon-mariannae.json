    "intro": "Andropogon mariannae, commonly known as the Marianna grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
