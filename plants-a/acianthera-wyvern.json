    "intro": "Acianthera wyvern, commonly known as the wyvern orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in its humid environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing organic matter in the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, the wyvern orchid is now classified as critically endangered.",
