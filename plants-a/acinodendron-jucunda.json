    "intro": "Acinodendron jucunda, commonly known as the yellow-barked acacia, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, yellowish bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.",
