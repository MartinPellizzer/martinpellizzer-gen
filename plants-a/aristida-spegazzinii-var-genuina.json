It is characterized by its fine, wiry foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bristly lemma-like structures. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resilience to grazing. This variety is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
