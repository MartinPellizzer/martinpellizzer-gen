    "intro": "Azorella chamitis, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of Chile. It forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from below the permafrost layer. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white wax, reducing water loss and protecting against intense UV radiation. Azorella chamitis is also known for its ability to flower and produce seeds even under extreme climatic conditions."
