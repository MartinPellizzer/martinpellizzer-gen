    "intro": "Acalypha tabascensis, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique morphological features. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges in color from green to reddish-brown. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically with a distinctive cyathium structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tabascensis is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. It is also found in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Belize. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in lowland areas near rivers and in disturbed habitats such as abandoned fields. Acalypha tabascensis is often associated with secondary growth and can be seen in forest edges and scrublands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tabascensis was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several states including Texas, Florida, and California, where it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential. However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive invasive species."
