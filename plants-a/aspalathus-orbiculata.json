It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are the primary part used, and they are harvested and processed to produce the popular herbal tea. Aspalathus orbiculata is also valued for its high antioxidant content and unique flavor profile."
