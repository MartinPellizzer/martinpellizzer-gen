    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme subsp. arctisibirica, commonly known as the Siberian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rosette-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the base of the stems during the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
