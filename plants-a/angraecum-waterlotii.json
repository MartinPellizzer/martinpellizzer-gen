    "intro": "Angraecum waterlotii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble stars, which bloom at night. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract night-flying moths for pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
