    "intro": "Asparagopsis retrofracta, commonly known as the red meat alternative or \"red algae,\" is a species of red algae belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its branching, filamentous structure and bright red coloration, which is due to the presence of phycoerythrin, a pigment that absorbs light for photosynthesis. This plant thrives in warm, shallow marine environments and is often found in tide pools and coastal areas. It plays a significant ecological role by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Due to its high protein content and ability to reduce the taste of ammonia, it has gained attention as a potential supplement in livestock feed."
