    "intro": "Asparagus karthikeyanii, commonly known as the Karthikeyan asparagus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of southern India, particularly the Western Ghats, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is characterized by its ability to form dense clumps and has a slow growth rate, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
