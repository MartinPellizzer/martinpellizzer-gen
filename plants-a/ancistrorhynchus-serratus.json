    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus serratus, commonly known as the serrated plecostomus, is a species of catfish native to the rivers of South America. It is characterized by its elongated body and a distinctive, serrated edge along its dorsal fin. The plant-like appearance of its body, with its bony plates, has led to its common name. It is often found in rocky or weedy habitats, where it uses its mouth to scrape algae from surfaces. This species plays an important role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by controlling algal growth."
