It is characterized by its striking white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has a slender, weeping habit with long, cascading branches that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. This ornamental tree is often planted for its aesthetic value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.",
