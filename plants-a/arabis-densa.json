    "intro": "Arabis densa, commonly known as dense rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. Arabis densa is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
