    "intro": "Androcalva fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's lichen, is a unique plant that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to substrates such as bark or stone. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its photosynthetic partner for energy. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and resistance to environmental stressors. Androcalva fraseri is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, where it plays a significant part in the lichen community."
