    "intro": "Agrostis diandra, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, dunes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a distinct midrib. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis diandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass in certain regions."
