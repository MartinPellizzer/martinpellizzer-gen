    "intro": "Asparagus burjaticus, commonly known as the Burjat asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are used in local cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in dry gardens."
