    "intro": "Amorphophallus dzui, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the surrounding ecosystem. The plant plays a vital role in supporting aquatic biodiversity and maintaining water quality in its native habitat."
