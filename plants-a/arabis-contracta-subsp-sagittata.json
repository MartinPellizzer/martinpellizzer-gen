    "intro": "Arabis contracta subsp. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate or arrow-shaped, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
