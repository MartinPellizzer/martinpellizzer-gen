    "intro": "Aleuritopteris argentea var. obscura, commonly known as the dark silver fern, is a variant of the silver fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
