    "intro": "Arabis soyeri, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Arabis soyeri typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in rockeries and alpine gardens."
