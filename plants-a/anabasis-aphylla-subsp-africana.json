    "intro": "Anabasis aphylla subsp. africana, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
