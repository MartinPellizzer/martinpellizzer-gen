    "intro": "Ageratina altissima var. roanensis, commonly known as Roan Mountain blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Ageratina altissima."
