    "intro": "Avenochloa pubescens var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine pubescent grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Due to its resilience, it is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest for ecological and horticultural studies."
