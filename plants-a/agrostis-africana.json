    "intro": "Agrostis africana, commonly known as African bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
