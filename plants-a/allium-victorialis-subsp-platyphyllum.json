It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are often used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly cultivated than other allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
