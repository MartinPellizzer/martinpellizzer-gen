    "intro": "Assonia longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a reduced leaf structure to minimize water loss. Assonia longicuspis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience in arid environments."
