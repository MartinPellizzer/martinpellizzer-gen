    "intro": "Alloplectus martinianus, commonly known as the Martin's burr, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces spiny, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Alloplectus martinianus thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields."
