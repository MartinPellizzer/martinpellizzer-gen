    "intro": "Aquifolium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage with dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardy nature and year-round visual interest contribute to its widespread cultivation."
