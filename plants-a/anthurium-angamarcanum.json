    "intro": "Anthurium angamarcanum, commonly known as the Angamarca arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium angamarcanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
