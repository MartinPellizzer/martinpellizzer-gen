    "intro": "Arivela limmenensis, commonly known as the Limmen Basin hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and is adapted to seasonal flooding, which influences its growth cycle. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Arivela limmenensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators."
