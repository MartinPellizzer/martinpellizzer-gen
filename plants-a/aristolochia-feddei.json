    "intro": "Aristolochia feddei, commonly known as the Fedde's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Due to its striking appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
