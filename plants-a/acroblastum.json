    "intro": "Acroblastum, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and their flowers are clustered in umbels or cymes. Acroblastum species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
