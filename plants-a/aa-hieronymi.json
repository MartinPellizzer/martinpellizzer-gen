    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa hieronymi was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Hawaii for its ornamental value and unique appearance. It is commonly found growing in rocky and sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to ensure it does not become invasive in local flora."
