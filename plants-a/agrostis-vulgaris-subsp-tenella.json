    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris subsp. tenella, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems that are often less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually shorter than the leaves. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental use and is also used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
