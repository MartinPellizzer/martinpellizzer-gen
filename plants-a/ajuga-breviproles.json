    "intro": "Ajuga breviproles, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Ajuga breviproles thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in moist, shady environments."
