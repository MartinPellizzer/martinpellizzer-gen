    "intro": "Aphelandra carduifolia, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, golden-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra carduifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting foliage."
