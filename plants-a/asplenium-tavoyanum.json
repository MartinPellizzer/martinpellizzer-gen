    "intro": "Asplenium tavoyanum, commonly known as the Tavoyan spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are often covered with a distinctive, hairy layer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
