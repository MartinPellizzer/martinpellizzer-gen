It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lilac flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. Althaea chinensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
