    "intro": "Austrodanthonia setacea, commonly known as the slender wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale-green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Austrodanthonia setacea is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
