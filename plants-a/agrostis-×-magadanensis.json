    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 magadanensis, commonly known as the Magadan grass, is a hybrid species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant is native to the cold regions of the Russian Far East and is adapted to harsh, temperate climates. It typically grows in open areas such as tundra and mountain slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
