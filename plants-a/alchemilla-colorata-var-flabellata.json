    "intro": "Alchemilla colorata var. flabellata, commonly known as the silver-sword plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
