    "intro": "Agrostis hallii var. pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of seeds. It is adapted to temperate climates and exhibits seasonal growth patterns. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
