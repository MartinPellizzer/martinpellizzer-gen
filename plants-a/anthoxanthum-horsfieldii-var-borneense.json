    "intro": "Anthoxanthum horsfieldii var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to brownish flowers. It is adapted to humid, low-light environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
