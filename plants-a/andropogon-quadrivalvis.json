    "intro": "Andropogon quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-angled grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its square, rigid stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
