    "intro": "Acanthopanax giraldii var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy angel's trumpet, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax giraldii var. hispidus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in dense forests and shrublands, often growing on rocky slopes or along stream banks. It is well adapted to the region's cool, moist conditions and is part of the local biodiversity in these ecosystems. The species is also occasionally reported in neighboring areas of northern Myanmar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax giraldii var. hispidus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in eastern Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has been observed in parts of China, Korea, and Japan, where it is often found in forest understories. The plant's introduction is associated with both natural dispersal and human activities, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. However, its spread outside native habitats requires careful monitoring to prevent potential ecological impacts."
