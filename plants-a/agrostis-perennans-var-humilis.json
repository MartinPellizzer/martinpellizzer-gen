    "intro": "Agrostis perennans var. humilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
