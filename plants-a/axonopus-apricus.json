    "intro": "Axonopus apricus, commonly known as the dwarf carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in shaded or moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture and a tendency to roll when dry. Axonopus apricus is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
