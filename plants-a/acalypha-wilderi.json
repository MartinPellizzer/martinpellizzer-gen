    "intro": "Acalypha wilderi, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild spurflower, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with smooth, often hairy stems. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, contributing to its common name. Acalypha wilderi produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by the showy bracts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha wilderi is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forest understories. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, humid climates with abundant rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wilderi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by birds and water, contributing to its rapid colonization of new habitats. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species."
