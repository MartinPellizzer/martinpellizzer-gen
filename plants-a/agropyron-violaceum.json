    "intro": "Agropyron violaceum, commonly known as purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that often display a purple or reddish hue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron violaceum is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
