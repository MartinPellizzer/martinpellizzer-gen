    "intro": "Atriplex elongata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Atriplex elongata is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
