    "intro": "Alchemilla mandoniana, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of leafless stalks. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid, high-altitude environments. Alchemilla mandoniana is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
