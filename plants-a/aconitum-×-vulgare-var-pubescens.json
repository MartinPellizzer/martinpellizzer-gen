    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 vulgare var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, downy pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
