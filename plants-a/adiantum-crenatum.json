    "intro": "Adiantum crenatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often tinged with a pale green or silver hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its small, spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum crenatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.",
