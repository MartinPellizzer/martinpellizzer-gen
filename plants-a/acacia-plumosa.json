    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia plumosa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a range of climatic conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Acacia plumosa is also known for its distinctive feathery foliage and yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia plumosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for regions with low rainfall. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its ornamental foliage, which adds visual interest to landscapes. However, it may become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
