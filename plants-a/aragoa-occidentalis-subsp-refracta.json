    "intro": "Aragoa occidentalis subsp. refracta, commonly known as the western aragoa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments. Its reproductive cycle involves self-pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
