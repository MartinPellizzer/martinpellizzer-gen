    "intro": "Asplenium magnum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense network of underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives it its common name. Asplenium magnum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
