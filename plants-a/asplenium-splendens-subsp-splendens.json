    "intro": "Asplenium splendens subsp. splendens, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, glossy leaflets. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, circular structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its lush, feathery appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in indoor and outdoor settings."
