    "intro": "Androsace henryi var. typica, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
