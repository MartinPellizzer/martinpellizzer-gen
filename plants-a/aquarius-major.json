    "intro": "Aquarius major, commonly known as the giant water star, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its large, star-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. Its leaves are typically bright green with a waxy texture, allowing them to remain buoyant and capture sunlight efficiently. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, which develop into fruiting bodies that release seeds into the water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in ornamental water gardens."
