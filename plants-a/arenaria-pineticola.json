    "intro": "Arenaria pineticola, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Arenaria pineticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
