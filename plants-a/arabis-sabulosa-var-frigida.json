    "intro": "Arabis sabulosa var. frigida, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
