    "intro": "Arbutus salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf arbutus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are alternate and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Arbutus salicifolia is known for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
