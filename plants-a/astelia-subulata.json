    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astilea subulata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms a rosette shape. The leaves are narrow, needle-like, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Astelia subulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
