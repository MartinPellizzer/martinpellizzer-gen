    "intro": "Aracium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy aracium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Aracium pubescens is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
