It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a compact addition to alpine gardens. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, come in shades of white, pink, and red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aquilegia minuta prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in cooler climates."
