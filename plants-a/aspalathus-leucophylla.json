    "intro": "Aspalathus leucophylla, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy soils. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce the popular herbal tea. The plant plays a significant role in both local ecosystems and the global tea industry."
