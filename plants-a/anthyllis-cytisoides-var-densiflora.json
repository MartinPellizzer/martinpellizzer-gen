It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often found in Mediterranean climates. Its dense flowering habit gives it its varietal name, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
