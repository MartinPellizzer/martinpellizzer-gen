    "intro": "Astragalus carminis, commonly known as the carmine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus carminis is known for its yellow to orange flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
