    "intro": "Adhatoda sulcata, commonly known as the wavy-leaved adhatoda, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite, simple, and have a slightly rough texture. Adhatoda sulcata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
