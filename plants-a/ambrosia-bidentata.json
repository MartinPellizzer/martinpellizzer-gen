    "intro": "Ambrosia bidentata, commonly known as the sand ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Ambrosiaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has feathery leaves and produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Ambrosia bidentata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
