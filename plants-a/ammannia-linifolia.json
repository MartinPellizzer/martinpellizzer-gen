    "intro": "Ammannia linifolia, commonly known as prairie bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
