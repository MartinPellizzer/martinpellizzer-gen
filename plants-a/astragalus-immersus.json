    "intro": "Astragalus immersus, commonly known as the submerged milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Astragalus immersus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators in its native habitat."
