    "intro": "Astragalus incanus var. incurvus, commonly known as the bentleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with the terminal leaflet being curved downward, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
