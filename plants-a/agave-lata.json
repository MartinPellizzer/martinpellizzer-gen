    "intro": "Agave lata, commonly known as the silver agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, white berries. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
