    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha dissitiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of forests. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and has been introduced to other tropical regions. Its native distribution is closely associated with humid climates and is often found near water sources or in disturbed habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dissitiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this species has been primarily limited to specific regions within New Zealand, particularly in the North Island. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Despite its introduction, it has not become widely established beyond these localized areas."
