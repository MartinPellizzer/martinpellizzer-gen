    "intro": "Ateleia standleyana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, palmate leaves, and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and the demand for its timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
