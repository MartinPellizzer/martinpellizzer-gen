    "intro": "Artemisia valentina, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves that emit a distinctive, often camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of the compound artemisinin."
