    "intro": "Asclepias \u00d7 purpurascens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a hybrid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, toxic to many animals but essential for monarch butterflies as a food source for their larvae. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias \u00d7 purpurascens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
