It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant is notable for its aromatic foliage, which releases a distinctive, sweet scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.
