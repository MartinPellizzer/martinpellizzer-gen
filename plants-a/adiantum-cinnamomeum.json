    "intro": "Adiantum cinnamomeum, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick, hence its common name. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with roots that anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Adiantum cinnamomeum thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight.",
