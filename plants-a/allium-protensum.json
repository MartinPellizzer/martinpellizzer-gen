    "intro": "Allium protensum, commonly known as the broad-leaved garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears umbels of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs, which are edible, are similar in appearance to garlic and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. Allium protensum is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued both for its culinary uses and its ornamental appeal."
