It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its varietal name \"pilosa.\" The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
