    "intro": "Aphyllon cooperi subsp. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed aphyllon, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
