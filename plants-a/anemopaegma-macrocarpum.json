    "intro": "Anemopaegma macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited anemopaegma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity."
