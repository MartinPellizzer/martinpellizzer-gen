    "intro": "Asclepias vinosa, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and velvety, hairy leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, especially the monarch butterfly. Asclepias vinosa plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable plant for native gardens."
