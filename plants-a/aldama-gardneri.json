    "intro": "Aldama gardneri, commonly known as the Arizona rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
