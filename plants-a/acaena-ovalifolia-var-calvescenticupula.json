    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. calvescenticupula, commonly known as the velvetcup bramble, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in cup-shaped inflorescences, which give it its specific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. calvescenticupula is primarily native to New Zealand. This variant is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. It grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. calvescenticupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
