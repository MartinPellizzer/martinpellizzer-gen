    "intro": "Altoparadisium scabrum var. bolivianum, commonly known as the Andean bitterleaf, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rugged, scabrous leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
