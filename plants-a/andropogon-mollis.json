    "intro": "Andropogon mollis, commonly known as silky grass or silky stalked grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance and long-lasting nature. Andropogon mollis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks."
