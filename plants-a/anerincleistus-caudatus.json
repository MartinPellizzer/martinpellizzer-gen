    "intro": "Anerincleistus caudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed cobra lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that resemble a cobra's head, which are typically bright red or orange with a contrasting black hood. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies and beetles."
