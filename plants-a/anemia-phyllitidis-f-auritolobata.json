It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-green thallus, which is often covered with a powdery layer of isidiate structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on bark or soil in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a distinctive lobed structure with prominent, rounded lobes and a dense arrangement of isidia. The species is notable for its chemical composition, containing compounds such as atranorin and chlorophyll, which contribute to its vibrant color and ecological role."
