It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue with prominent veins. Aira acutigluma is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
