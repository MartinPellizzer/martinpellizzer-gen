It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus apilosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
