    "intro": "Anopteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread along rocky substrates, often found in coastal areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound with short, stiff pinnae that are covered in a fine layer of hairs. Anopteris intermedia is well adapted to harsh environments, including high salinity and wind exposure."
