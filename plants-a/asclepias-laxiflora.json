    "intro": "Asclepias laxiflora, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often fuzzy to the touch. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias laxiflora is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
