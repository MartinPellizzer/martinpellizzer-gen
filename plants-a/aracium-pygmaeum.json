    "intro": "Aracium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf aracium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features compact, rounded foliage with dense, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant."
