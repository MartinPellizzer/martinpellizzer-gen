It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, needle-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping.
