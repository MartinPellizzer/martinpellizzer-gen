    "intro": "Aphloia, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Africa, particularly found in regions such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Aphloia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions. These plants are also valued for their ornamental appeal and have traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
