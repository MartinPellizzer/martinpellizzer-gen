    "intro": "Avena fatua f. brachytricha, commonly known as the short-haired wild oat, is a variant of the wild oat species characterized by its shorter and more compact inflorescence. It is a grassy plant belonging to the Poaceae family, typically found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its seeds are similar to those of other oat species but are often smaller and more densely packed. This form is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
