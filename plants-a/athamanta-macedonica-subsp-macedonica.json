    "intro": "Athamanta macedonica subsp. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian athamanta, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous areas. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
