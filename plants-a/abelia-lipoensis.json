    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia lipoensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in forested areas and along streamside habitats. It is well adapted to the moist, cool conditions of its native environment. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most commonly associated with its original habitat in southern China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia lipoensis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the region. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for a variety of garden environments. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Despite its beauty, Abelia lipoensis is considered an invasive species in certain parts of its range."
