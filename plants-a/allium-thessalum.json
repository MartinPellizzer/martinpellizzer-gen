    "intro": "Allium thessalum, commonly known as the Thessalian leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to leeks but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is often cultivated in gardens across southern Europe."
