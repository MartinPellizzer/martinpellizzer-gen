    "intro": "Alyssum akamasicum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Alyssum akamasicum is often found in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions."
