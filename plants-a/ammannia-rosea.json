    "intro": "Ammannia rosea, commonly known as the redroot dayflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters, typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Ammannia rosea thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to wetland gardens and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
