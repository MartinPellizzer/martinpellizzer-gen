    "intro": "Acacia bivenosa subsp. wayi, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in adult plants. The plant produces yellow to golden-yellow inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are encased in a woody pod, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Acacia bivenosa subsp. wayi is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood in its native habitat.",

It is found in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo. This subspecies thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in dry forests and savannas. Its distribution is also observed in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia bivenosa subsp. wayi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions of southern Africa. It is commonly found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops where it thrives in full sun. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to several countries in the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe for ornamental and reforestation purposes. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
