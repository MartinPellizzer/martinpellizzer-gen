    "intro": "Acalypha evrardii, commonly known as the red-hot catshrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha evrardii thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha evrardii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha evrardii was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found along roadsides, in vacant lots, and near waterways due to its adaptability to human-altered environments. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in disturbed soils. While it is not considered invasive in its native range, it has been reported in some regions where it may outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as landscaping or accidental seed dispersal."
