    "intro": "Arundarbor angulata, commonly known as the angular leaf fern, is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of roots. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Arundarbor angulata is often found in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions."
