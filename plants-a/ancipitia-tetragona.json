    "intro": "Ancipitia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its square, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ancipitia tetragona plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
