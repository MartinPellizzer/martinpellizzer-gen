    "intro": "Apetalon minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered apetalon, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are usually greenish-white and lack showy petals. Apetalon minutum is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
