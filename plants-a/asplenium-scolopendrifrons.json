    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendrifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy, and often dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
