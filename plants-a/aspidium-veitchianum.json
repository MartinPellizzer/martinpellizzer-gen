    "intro": "Aspidium veitchianum, commonly known as the Veitch's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Aspidium veitchianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic settings."
