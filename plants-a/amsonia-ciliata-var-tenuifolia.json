    "intro": "Amsonia ciliata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers in late summer. The plant has finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
