It is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
