    "intro": "Allium nevadense var. cristatum, commonly known as the Sierra onion or mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to purple flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant for both culinary and medicinal use. The varietal form 'cristatum' is distinguished by its distinctive, slightly curled leaves that give it a unique appearance."
