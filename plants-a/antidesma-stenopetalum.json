    "intro": "Antidesma stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptic or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Antidesma stenopetalum is often found in dry, open woodlands and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
