    "intro": "Athyrium asplenioides f. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Athyrmiaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical, and serrated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread slowly. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
