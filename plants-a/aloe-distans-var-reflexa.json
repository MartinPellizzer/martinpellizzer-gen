    "intro": "Aloe distans var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive reflexed or curled tip. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
