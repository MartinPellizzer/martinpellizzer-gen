It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
