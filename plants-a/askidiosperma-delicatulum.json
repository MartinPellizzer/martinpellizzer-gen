    "intro": "Askidiosperma delicatulum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments and furniture. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, leading to conservation efforts to protect its population."
