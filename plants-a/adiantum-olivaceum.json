    "intro": "Adiantum olivaceum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are pale green with a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Adiantum olivaceum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
