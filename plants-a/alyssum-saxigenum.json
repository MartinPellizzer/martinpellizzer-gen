    "intro": "Alyssum saxigenum, commonly known as alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Alyssum saxigenum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
