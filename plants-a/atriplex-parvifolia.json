    "intro": "Atriplex parvifolia, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Atriplex parvifolia is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert landscapes and along riverbanks."
