    "intro": "Alnus incana var. borealis, commonly known as the northern gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish bark and small, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. This species is often found in wetland areas, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are important for pollination and provide food for various wildlife species. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its habitat."
