It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus tamiricus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
