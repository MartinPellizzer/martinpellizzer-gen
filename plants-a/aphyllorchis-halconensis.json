    "intro": "Aphyllorchis halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with intricate petal arrangements. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
