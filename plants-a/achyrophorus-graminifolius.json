    "intro": "Achyrophorus graminifolius, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that produces yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. The plant is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.",
