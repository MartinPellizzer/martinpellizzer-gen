    "intro": "Allomorphia arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like allomorph, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Allomorphia arborescens is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
