    "intro": "Alnus februaria var. incana, commonly known as the gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system."
