    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. brevicaulis, commonly known as narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in branched inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and open woodlands. Due to its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional medicine, it has been of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
