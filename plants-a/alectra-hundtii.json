It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers resembling those of the dandelion. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Alectra hundtii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert wildlife."
