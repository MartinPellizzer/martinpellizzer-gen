    "intro": "Amaracarpus kraemeri, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grey-barked trunk. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, savanna-like habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
