    "intro": "Astragalus amblytropis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
