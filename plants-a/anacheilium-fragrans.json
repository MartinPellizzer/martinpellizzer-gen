It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
