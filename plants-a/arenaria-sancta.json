    "intro": "Arenaria sancta, commonly known as the sacred sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria sancta is valued for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
