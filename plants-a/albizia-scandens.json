    "intro": "Albizia scandens, commonly known as the weeping albizia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps in soil stabilization. Albizia scandens is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
