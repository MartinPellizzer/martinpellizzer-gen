    "intro": "Asplenium denudatum, commonly known as the naked spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium denudatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
