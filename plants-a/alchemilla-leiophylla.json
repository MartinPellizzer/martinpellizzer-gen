    "intro": "Alchemilla leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, waxy leaves that remain green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Alchemilla leiophylla is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
