It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact, cylindrical clusters called\u7a57, which bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
