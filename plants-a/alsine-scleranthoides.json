    "intro": "Alsine scleranthoides, commonly known as the slender sand-plant, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has small, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in coastal dunes or inland sandy plains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
