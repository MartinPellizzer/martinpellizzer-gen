    "intro": "Acacia suaveolens var. platycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens var. platycarpa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands. It thrives in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens var. platycarpa was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and inland areas with similar conditions. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems in non-native habitats."
