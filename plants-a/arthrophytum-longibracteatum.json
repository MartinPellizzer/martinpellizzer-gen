    "intro": "Arthrophytum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract horsehead cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, appear in the summer and are clustered at the top of the plant. Arthrophytum longibracteatum is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
