    "intro": "Aster atropurpurea, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces ray florets that resemble petals and disk florets that form the central cone-like structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a grayish-green color. Aster atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
