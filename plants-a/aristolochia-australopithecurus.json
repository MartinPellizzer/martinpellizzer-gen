    "intro": "Aristolochia australopithecurus, commonly known as the Australian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are typically borne in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies and beetles. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant potentially hazardous."
