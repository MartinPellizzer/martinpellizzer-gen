    "intro": "Antennaria athabascensis, commonly known as the Athabasca sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit with small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, rounded fruits that disperse its seeds. Antennaria athabascensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is an indicator species for arctic tundra ecosystems."
