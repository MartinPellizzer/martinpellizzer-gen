    "intro": "Agrostis gunniana, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Agrostis gunniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy or coastal environments."
