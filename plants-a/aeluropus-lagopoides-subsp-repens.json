    "intro": "Aeluropus lagopoides subsp. repens, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow,\u575a\u97e7 (resilient), and adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent soil erosion in harsh environments."
