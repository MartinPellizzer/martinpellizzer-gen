    "intro": "Acantholimon taschkurganicum, commonly known as the Taschkurgan stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the western and southern areas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine and subalpine zones. The species is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local flora and ecosystem of Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon taschkurganicum was mainly introduced to the Central Asian region, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It is commonly found in dry steppes and semi-desert areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in these environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. However, its introduction to new areas has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
