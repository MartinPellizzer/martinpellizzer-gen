    "intro": "Allocasuarina crassa, commonly known as the rough casuarina, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage composed of cylindrical, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
