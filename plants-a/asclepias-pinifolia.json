    "intro": "Asclepias pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, pine-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Asclepias pinifolia plays an important role in supporting native pollinators, including monarch butterflies."
