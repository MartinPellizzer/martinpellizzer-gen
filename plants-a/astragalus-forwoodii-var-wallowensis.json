    "intro": "Astragalus forwoodii var. wallowensis, commonly known as the Wallowa milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
