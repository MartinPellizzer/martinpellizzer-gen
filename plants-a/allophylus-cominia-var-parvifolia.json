    "intro": "Allophylus cominia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alderleaf, is a variant of the Allophylus cominia species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by clusters of small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. The botanical characteristics of this variant make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
