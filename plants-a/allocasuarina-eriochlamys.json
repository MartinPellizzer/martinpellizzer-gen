It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically appearing in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several elliptical seeds. Allocasuarina eriochlamys is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
