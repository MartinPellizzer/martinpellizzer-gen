    "intro": "Aulomyrcia atropilosa, commonly known as the black-leaved myrtle, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Aulomyrcia atropilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
