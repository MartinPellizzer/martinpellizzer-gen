    "intro": "Androsace squarrosula, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a cushion-like growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture and resist cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are generally covered in a fine layer of white tomentum, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. Androsace squarrosula thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
