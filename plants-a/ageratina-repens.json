    "intro": "Ageratina repens, commonly known as whitefoot ageratum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Ageratina repens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
