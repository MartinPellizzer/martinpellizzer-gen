    "intro": "Anguina cuspidata, commonly known as the cuspidate nematode, is a microscopic plant-parasitic nematode belonging to the family Anguinidae. It primarily infects the roots of various plants, including economically important crops such as wheat and barley. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, with the infective second-stage larvae penetrating the root tissues. Anguina cuspidata feeds on root cells, causing damage that can lead to reduced growth and yield in affected plants. Its presence is often indicated by symptoms such as stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and poor overall plant health."
