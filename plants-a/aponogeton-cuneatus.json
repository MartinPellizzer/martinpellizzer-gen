    "intro": "Aponogeton cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots extending into the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged, followed by distinctive, boat-shaped seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure. Aponogeton cuneatus is popular in aquascaping due to its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
