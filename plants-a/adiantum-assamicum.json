    "intro": "Adiantum assamicum, commonly known as the Assam maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum assamicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
