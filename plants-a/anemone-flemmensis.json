    "intro": "Anemone flemmensis, commonly known as the Flemish anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet meadows and marshes of northern Europe. It features showy, single or double flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist habitats. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Anemone flemmensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in waterlogged areas."
