    "intro": "Antennaria margaritacea var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, grass-like leaves that help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine flora."
