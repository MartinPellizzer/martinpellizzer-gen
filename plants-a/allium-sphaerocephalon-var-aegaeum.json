    "intro": "Allium sphaerocephalon var. aegaeum, commonly known as the Armenian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its bulb, which is typically smaller and more rounded compared to common garlic. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild garlic scent. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
