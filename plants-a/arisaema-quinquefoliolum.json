It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a typical feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution."
