    "intro": "Asplenium nigripes, commonly known as the black-footed spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Asplenium nigripes is a hardy species that is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
