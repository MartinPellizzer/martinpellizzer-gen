    "intro": "Astragalus tiroliensis, commonly known as the Tyrol milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
