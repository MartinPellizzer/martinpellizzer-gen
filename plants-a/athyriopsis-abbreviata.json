    "intro": "Athyriopsis abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
