    "intro": "Argophyllum vernicosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved argophyllum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salty air, making it a common sight in coastal heathlands. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
