It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Arundinaria disticha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
