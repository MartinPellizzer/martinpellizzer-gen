    "intro": "Astragalus pseudocylindraceus, commonly known as the narrow-cylindric milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus pseudocylindraceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
