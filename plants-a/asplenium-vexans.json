    "intro": "Asplenium vexans, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually across the ground. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typically in clusters. Asplenium vexans is often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich conditions."
