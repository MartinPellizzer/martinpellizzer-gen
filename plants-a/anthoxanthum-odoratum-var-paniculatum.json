    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. paniculatum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for wheat or rye due to their similar appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. Sweet vernalgrass is also notable for its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which is most noticeable when the plant is in bloom."
