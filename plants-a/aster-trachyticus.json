    "intro": "Aster trachyticus, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a compact, bushy growth habit with numerous narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. Aster trachyticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
