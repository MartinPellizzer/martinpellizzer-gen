    "intro": "Aira stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
