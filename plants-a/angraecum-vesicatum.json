    "intro": "Angraecum vesicatum, commonly known as the giant star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with yellow markings, which bloom at night, attracting nectar-feeding moths. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and can grow up to several meters in height, making it one of the tallest orchids in the world. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. Angraecum vesicatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
