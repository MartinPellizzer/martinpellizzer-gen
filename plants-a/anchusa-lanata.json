    "intro": "Anchusa lanata, commonly known as velvet flower or woolly anchusa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage covered in dense, soft hairs, which give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces striking blue to violet flower clusters in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Anchusa lanata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
