    "intro": "Aster tripolium subsp. minoricensis, commonly known as the Minorca aster, is a flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
