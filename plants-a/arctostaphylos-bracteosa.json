It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its rugged appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control."
