    "intro": "Arenaria stricta subsp. macra, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, ascending stems with small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
