    "intro": "Astragalus macrolacis, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated seed pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus macrolacis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
