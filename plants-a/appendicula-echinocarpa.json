    "intro": "Appendicula echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny-fruited appendicula, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruits are distinctive, being spiny and capsule-like, which aid in seed dispersal. Appendicula echinocarpa is often grown as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and compact growth habit."
