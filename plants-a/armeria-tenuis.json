    "intro": "Armeria tenuis, commonly known as slender thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Armeria tenuis is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
