    "intro": "Acalypha kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Koto in the Japanese archipelago. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha kotoensis is primarily native to the Ryukyu Islands, specifically Okinawa and the Amami Islands in southern Japan. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal areas and is sometimes seen growing on cliffs or in disturbed habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha kotoensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first documented in the early 2000s as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this species is primarily confined to the island of Oahu, where it has been found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and remains a rare plant in the local ecosystem. Its presence is closely monitored to ensure it does not spread beyond its current range."
