    "intro": "Asplenium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are smooth and glossy. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium glabratum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
