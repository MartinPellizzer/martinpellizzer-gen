It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Arnica lanigera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
