    "intro": "Alnus incana f. coccinea, commonly known as the redleaf alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to the northern hemisphere. This deciduous shrub or small tree is characterized by its distinctive reddish-purple leaves, which turn vibrant red in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Alnus incana f. coccinea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
