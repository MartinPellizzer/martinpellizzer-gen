    "intro": "Alcoceratothrix rugosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rugose alcoceratothrix, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive, rugged leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and exhibit a unique, corrugated texture that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
