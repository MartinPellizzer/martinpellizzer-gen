    "intro": "Azorella columnaris, commonly known as the Andean stonecrop, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a succulent perennial that forms dense, cushion-like growths, often appearing as a rock-like structure. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. Its flowers are typically small, white or pink, and bloom in late summer. Azorella columnaris is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils."
