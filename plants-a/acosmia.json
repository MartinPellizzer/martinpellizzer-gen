    "intro": "Acosmia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, often with a striking color contrast between the petals and the throat. Acosmia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant's unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
