    "intro": "Asclepias albicans, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. Asclepias albicans plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
