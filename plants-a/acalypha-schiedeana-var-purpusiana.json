    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. purpusiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America and northern South America. It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of Colombia. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and in secondary forests. Its distribution is also reported in some Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Hispaniola.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. purpusiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. This plant is often used as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth rate. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is largely driven by human activity, including horticultural trade and land clearing."
