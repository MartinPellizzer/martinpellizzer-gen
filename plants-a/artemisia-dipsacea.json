    "intro": "Artemisia dipsacea, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia dipsacea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal uses."
