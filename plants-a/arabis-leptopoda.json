    "intro": "Arabis leptopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Arabis leptopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
