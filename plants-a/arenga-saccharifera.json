    "intro": "Arenga saccharifera, commonly known as the sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces a fibrous material called sago, which is extracted from its stem and used as a starch source. Arenga saccharifera thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in certain ecosystems."
