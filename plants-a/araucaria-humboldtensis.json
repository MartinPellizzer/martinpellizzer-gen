It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces large, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. This species is valued for its ecological role and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
