    "intro": "Amphiglossa celans, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Amphiglossa celans is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
