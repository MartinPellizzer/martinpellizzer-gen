    "intro": "Arthropodium lindleyi, commonly known as the New Zealand spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble legs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in damp, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
