    "intro": "Anopteris, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Anopteris species are often found growing on rocky outcrops, cliffs, and in shaded, moist environments. They have a robust rhizome system that allows them to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. The genus includes several species, such as Anopteris panicea, which is widely distributed across Asia and the Pacific."
