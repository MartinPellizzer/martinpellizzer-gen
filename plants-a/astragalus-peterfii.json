It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and Kazakhstan. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish to brownish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
