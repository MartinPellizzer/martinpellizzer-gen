    "intro": "Allium unifolium var. lacteum, commonly known as the milk leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pale green leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a small, white or pale purple flower cluster. The plant produces small, bulbous structures at the base of the stem, which are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional cuisines."
