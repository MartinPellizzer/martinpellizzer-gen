    "intro": "Arrabidaea nigrescens, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dark, glossy bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, leathery seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
