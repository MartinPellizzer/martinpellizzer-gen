    "intro": "Alisma enneandrum, commonly known as the nine-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic herb native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pale pink flower cluster. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water. Alisma enneandrum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
