    "intro": "Agrostis poluninii var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. It produces numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers that mature into bristly, awned seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
