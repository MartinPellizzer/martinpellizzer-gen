    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its foliage is typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss in dry environments."
