    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon flanaganii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. Abutilon flanaganii is also occasionally found in parts of Nevada and Baja California.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon flanaganii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water. It competes with native vegetation for resources. Its presence poses a threat to the local ecosystem."
