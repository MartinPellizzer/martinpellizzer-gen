    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ochreata is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats. It is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its small, yellowish flowers. Acaena ochreata is an important component of the local flora in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ochreata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often associated with human activity. It has become naturalized in several regions, spreading through seed dispersal by birds and wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some areas."
