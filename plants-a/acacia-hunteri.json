    "intro": "Acacia hunteri, commonly known as the Hunter's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Acacia hunteri is often found in sandy soils and is resilient to drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hunteri is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its deep root system allowing it to access water from deeper underground. Acacia hunteri is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hunteri was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, it has also been reported to spread into native vegetation, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has led to increased ecological monitoring in areas where it may compete with indigenous plant species."
