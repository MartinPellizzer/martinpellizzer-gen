    "intro": "Allium cornutum, commonly known as the horned garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs, which resemble those of garlic, are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. Allium cornutum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses in traditional cuisines."
