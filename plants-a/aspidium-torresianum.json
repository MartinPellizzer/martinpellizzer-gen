    "intro": "Aspidium torresianum, commonly known as the Torresian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. Aspidium torresianum is also noted for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks."
