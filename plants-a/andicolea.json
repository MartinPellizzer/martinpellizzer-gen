    "intro": "Andicolea, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds. The plant is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
