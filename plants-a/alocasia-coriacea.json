    "intro": "Alocasia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaf alocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and textured, with a rough, waxy surface. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters, featuring a stout, rhizomatous stem. Its foliage is often a deep green with a silvery-white underside, adding to its ornamental appeal. Alocasia coriacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
