    "intro": "Artemisia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Artemisia velutina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
