    "intro": "Acalypha brachiata, commonly known as the flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often palmate, with lobes radiating from a central point, giving it a distinctive appearance. Acalypha brachiata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brachiata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland forests and is sometimes seen near water sources. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely associated with humid climates and is often part of the understory vegetation in tropical rainforests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brachiata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its initial popularity in gardens, it has since become a weed in some regions, spreading beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate have contributed to its establishment in the wild. However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a topic of ongoing study and management."
