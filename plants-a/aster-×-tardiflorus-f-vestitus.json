    "intro": "Aster \u00d7 tardiflorus f. vestitus, commonly known as the woolly lateflower aster, is a hybrid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall, typically from August to October. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This perennial herb is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
