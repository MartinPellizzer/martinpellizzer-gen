    "intro": "Actaea arguta var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered smooth bugbane, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features tall, unbranched stems that bear large, compound leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are distinctive for their lack of typical showy petals. Its roots are rhizomatous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The foliage and flowers are generally non-toxic but may cause mild skin irritation in some individuals.",
