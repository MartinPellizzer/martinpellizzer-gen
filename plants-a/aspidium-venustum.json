    "intro": "Aspidium venustum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. Aspidium venustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its vibrant foliage."
