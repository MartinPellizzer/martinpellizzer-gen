    "intro": "Anthurium terrestre, commonly known as the ground anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium terrestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
