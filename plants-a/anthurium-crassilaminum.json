It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are often brightly colored and serve as the flower structure. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium crassilaminum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
