    "intro": "Allium cepa var. crinides, commonly known as the curly garlic. This variety is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that form a dense rosette. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, typical of the Allium genus. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. While it shares some characteristics with regular garlic, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its culinary use."
