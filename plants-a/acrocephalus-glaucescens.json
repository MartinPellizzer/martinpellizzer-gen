The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Acrocephalus glaucescens thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges.",
