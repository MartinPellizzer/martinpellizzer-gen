    "intro": "Asplenium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori, typically located near the leaf tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, and is often found in temperate regions. Asplenium coarctatum is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on other plants or rocks without being parasitic."
