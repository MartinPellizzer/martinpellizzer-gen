    "intro": "Acalypha phleoides f. dioica, commonly known as the dioecious variant of the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that are often red or purple in color. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with lowland areas. It is often seen in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed soils. Its native range extends into parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha phleoides f. dioica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to establish itself in disturbed areas. Its distribution is primarily limited to the North Island, though it has been reported in parts of the South Island as well."
