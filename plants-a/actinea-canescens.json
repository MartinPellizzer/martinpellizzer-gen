    "intro": "Actinea canescens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive rosette of silvery-white, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in an umbel-like structure. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Actinea canescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.",
