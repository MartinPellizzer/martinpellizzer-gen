    "intro": "Atheropogon triaena, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, three-branched spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Atheropogon triaena plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
