    "intro": "Allium sessile, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States, characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of small, white, bulbous flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a bulbous structure similar to garlic, though it is not typically used as a culinary ingredient. Allium sessile is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
