    "intro": "Atriplex plebeia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt deserts, and disturbed sites. Atriplex plebeia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
