It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix and spathe. The plant features strap-like leaves that are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy surface. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to traditional arrowroot. Acoridium simile thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.",
