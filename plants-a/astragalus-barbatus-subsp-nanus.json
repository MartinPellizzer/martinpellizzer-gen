    "intro": "Astragalus barbatus subsp. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, upright stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically produces small, kidney-shaped seeds enclosed in a hairy pod. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry slopes, gravelly plains, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
