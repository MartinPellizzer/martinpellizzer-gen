    "intro": "Aspidopterys obcordata var. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan aspidopterys, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark red berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
