    "intro": "Aira valesiaca, commonly known as the alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
