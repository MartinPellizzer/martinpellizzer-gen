    "intro": "Anacheilium baculus, commonly known as the slender stem orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in its moist but nutrient-poor habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Anacheilium baculus is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to preserve its genetic diversity."
