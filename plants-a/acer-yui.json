    "intro": "Acer yui, commonly known as the Yui maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, slender form and delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Acer yui is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings.",
