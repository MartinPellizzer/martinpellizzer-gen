    "intro": "Astragalus candidissimus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
