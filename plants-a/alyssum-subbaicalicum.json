    "intro": "Alyssum subbaicalicum, commonly known as the Siberian alyssum, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant features wiry stems and a mat-forming growth habit, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Alyssum subbaicalicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
