    "intro": "Acaena buchananii var. inermis, commonly known as the soft burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. The plant has compound leaves with multiple pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions, often found in coastal and inland areas. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This variant is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly in the South Island. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive bracteate flowers. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local insect and bird populations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena buchananii var. inermis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. This plant is now considered an invasive species in many regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has led to ecological concerns due to its ability to form dense stands."
