The plant's inflorescence is a tall, branched structure that bears showy, violet to pink flowers. Its foliage is typically green with red or purple markings, adding to its ornamental value. Aechmea curranii thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil and regular misting for optimal growth."
