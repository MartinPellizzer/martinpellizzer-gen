    "intro": "Alseuosmia, commonly known as the stink plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and its distinctive, often unpleasant odor. The plant is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Alseuosmia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often waxy leaves. The botanical features of Alseuosmia make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
