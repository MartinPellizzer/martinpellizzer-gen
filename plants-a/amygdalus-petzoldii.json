    "intro": "Amygdalus petzoldii, commonly known as the Petzold's almond, is a rare and ancient species native to the Middle East. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic relationship to other almond species and its potential for cultivation in arid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
