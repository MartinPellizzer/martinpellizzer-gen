    "intro": "Anatropanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Anatropanthus is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator of wetland health."
