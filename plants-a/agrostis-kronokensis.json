    "intro": "Agrostis kronokensis, commonly known as the Kronsberg bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. Agrostis kronokensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
