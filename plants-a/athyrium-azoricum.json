    "intro": "Athyrium azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium azoricum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
