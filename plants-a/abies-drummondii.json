    "intro": "Abies drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces cones that are typically 3 to 5 inches long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its needles are flat and have a distinct blue-green hue. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine forests.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies drummondii is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. This species thrives in high elevation forests and is often associated with pine and fir woodlands. It prefers well-drained soils and cooler, moist environments. Abies drummondii is an important component of the subalpine and montane ecosystems in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies drummondii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in regions with high elevations and cool, moist climates. It is commonly found in areas such as Washington, Oregon, and northern California. This species is often planted in urban landscapes and as a ornamental tree due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
