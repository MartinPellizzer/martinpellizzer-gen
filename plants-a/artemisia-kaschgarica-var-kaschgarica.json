    "intro": "Artemisia kaschgarica var. kaschgarica, commonly known as the Karakorum wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological role, it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
