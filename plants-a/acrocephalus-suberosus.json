    "intro": "Acrocephalus suberosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, lake margins, and riverbanks. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often covered in a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Acrocephalus suberosus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.",
