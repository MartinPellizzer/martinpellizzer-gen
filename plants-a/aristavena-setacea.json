    "intro": "Aristavena setacea, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are typical of the arum family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
