    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
