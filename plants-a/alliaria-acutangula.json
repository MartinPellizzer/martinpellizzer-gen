    "intro": "Alliaria acutangula, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has a strong garlic-like odor due to sulfur-containing compounds in its leaves and stems. It is often considered an invasive species in North America, where it outcompetes native plants in forest understories. Its life cycle includes a dormant phase during the summer, allowing it to persist through harsh conditions."
