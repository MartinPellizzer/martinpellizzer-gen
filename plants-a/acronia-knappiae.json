    "intro": "Acronia knappiae, commonly known as the Knapp's acronia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia knappiae is considered a conservation concern.",
