    "intro": "Aspidium freyreissii, commonly known as the Freyreiss's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically green and have a feathery appearance. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Aspidium freyreissii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
