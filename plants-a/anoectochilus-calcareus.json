    "intro": "Anoectochilus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on limestone substrates. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
