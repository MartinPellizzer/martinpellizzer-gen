    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subproles variegata, commonly known as the variegated honey vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often variegated with white or green markings. This plant is typically found in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in Mediterranean climates. It has adapted to thrive in harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. The variegation in its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
