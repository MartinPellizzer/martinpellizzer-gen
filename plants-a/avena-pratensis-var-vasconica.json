    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. vasconica, commonly known as the Spanish oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
