    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 glaucum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Apocynum venetum (Chinese milkweed). It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and hairy, ridged stems. The plant produces milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Apocynum \u00d7 glaucum plays a role in supporting pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in traditional herbal medicine."
