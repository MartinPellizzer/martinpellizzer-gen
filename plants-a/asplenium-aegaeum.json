    "intro": "Asplenium aegaeum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically has two types of leaves: sterile, spore-bearing fronds and fertile, spore-producing fronds. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats. Asplenium aegaeum is well-adapted to rocky habitats and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for shaded garden areas."
