    "intro": "Axonopus compressus var. australis, commonly known as Australian mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It forms dense, mat-like growths that spread rapidly through rhizomes, creating a thick ground cover. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are compressed and tightly rolled, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is highly tolerant of drought and poor soil conditions. This grass is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover."
