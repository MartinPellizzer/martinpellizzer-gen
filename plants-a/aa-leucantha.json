    "intro": "Aa leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered datura, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Aa leucantha is known for its potent alkaloids, which make it both toxic and historically significant in traditional Hawaiian medicine. Its unique ecological role and striking appearance make it a notable species in Hawaiian flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa leucantha is primarily native to Colombia and Ecuador. It is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. The plant thrives in humid, forested environments. It is often associated with mountainous areas in the Andes. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa leucantha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It was brought to these regions during the 19th century by European settlers and horticulturists. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread. However, efforts are being made to control its population to protect local ecosystems."
