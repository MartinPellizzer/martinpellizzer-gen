    "intro": "Albizia plurijuga, commonly known as the silkwood tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Albizia plurijuga is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
