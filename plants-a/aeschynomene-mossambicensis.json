It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Aeschynomene mossambicensis is also valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
