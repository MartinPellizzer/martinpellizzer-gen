    "intro": "Aloe hazeliana var. howmanii, commonly known as the Howman's aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
