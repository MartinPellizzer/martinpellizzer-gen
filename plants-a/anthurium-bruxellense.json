It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the spathe, which are typically green or yellow. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium bruxellense thrives in humid, warm environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic value."
