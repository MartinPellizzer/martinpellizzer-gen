    "intro": "Aloe capmanambatoensis, commonly known as the Capmanambato aloe, is a rare succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
