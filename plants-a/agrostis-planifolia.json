    "intro": "Agrostis planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, flat leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
