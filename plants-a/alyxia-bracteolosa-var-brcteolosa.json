    "intro": "Alyxia bracteolosa var. brcteolosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
