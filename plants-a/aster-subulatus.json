    "intro": "Aster subulatus, commonly known as the needleleaf aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, mat-forming clusters. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. Aster subulatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
