    "intro": "Angraecum wakefieldii, commonly known as the Wakefield's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It blooms during the dry season, typically between July and October, and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
