    "intro": "Abies concolor var. violacea, commonly known as the violetleaf white fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-tinged foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a slight bluish or purplish hue on the underside.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor var. violacea is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the states of California, Oregon, and Nevada. It is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. This variety of the white fir is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It grows in coniferous forests, often alongside other species such as Douglas fir and lodgepole pine. Its distribution is closely tied to specific microclimates that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor var. violacea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking violet-tinged foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas for its aesthetic value. This variety is favored for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact and habitat disruption."
