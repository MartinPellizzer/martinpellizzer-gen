It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, rhombic-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, partially shaded environments.",
