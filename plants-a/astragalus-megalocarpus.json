    "intro": "Astragalus megalocarpus, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its robust, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus megalocarpus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
