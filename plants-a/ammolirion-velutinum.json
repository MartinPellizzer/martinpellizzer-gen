It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to various soil types, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Ammolirion velutinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
