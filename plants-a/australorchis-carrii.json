    "intro": "Australorchis carrii, commonly known as the Carri's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically blooms in spring, and its flowers are often pollinated by native bees and wasps. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
