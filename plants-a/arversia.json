    "intro": "Arversia, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange inflorescences, which consist of many small florets arranged in a composite flower head. Arversia species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has fibrous roots and can grow up to several feet tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
