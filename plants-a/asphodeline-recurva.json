It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, pale green or yellowish flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
