    "intro": "Anthoxanthum horsfieldii var. viridescens, commonly known as the greenish false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dull green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellow to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its slightly lighter green coloration compared to other varieties of Anthoxanthum."
