    "intro": "Adinobotrys katinganensis, commonly known as the Katingan tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory where it receives filtered sunlight. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.",
