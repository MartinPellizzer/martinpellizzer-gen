    "intro": "Aeluropus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland desert margins. Aeluropus arabicus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
