    "intro": "Amsinckia irritans, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amsinckia irritans is adapted to arid environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its common name reflects the irritating effects of its hairs, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
