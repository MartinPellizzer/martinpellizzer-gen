It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination.
