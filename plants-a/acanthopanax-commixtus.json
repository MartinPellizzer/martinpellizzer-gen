    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax commixtus is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas within these countries. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with humid, shaded environments. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern parts of China, such as the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax commixtus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. It is commonly found in forested regions, often growing along stream banks or in moist, shaded understories. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. Its introduction has been documented in several Asian countries, including China, Korea, and Japan. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
