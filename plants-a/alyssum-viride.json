It features small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum viride is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings."
