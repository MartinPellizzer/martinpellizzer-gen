    "intro": "Agrostis zerovii, commonly known as the Zerov's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
