    "intro": "Antiphytum paniculatum, commonly known as the clustered antiphytum, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Antiphytum paniculatum is typically grown as a container plant due to its preference for well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
