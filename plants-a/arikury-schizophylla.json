    "intro": "Arikury schizophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds and produce spores for propagation. Arikury schizophylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
