It produces small, round, green fruits with a rough, bark-like rind. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are yellowish-green with a strong, unpleasant odor, typical of the Annonaceae family. The fruit is edible, though its flavor is often described as bland or slightly sour."
