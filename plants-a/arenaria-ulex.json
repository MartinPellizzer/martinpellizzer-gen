    "intro": "Arenaria ulex, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria ulex is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
