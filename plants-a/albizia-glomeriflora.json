    "intro": "Albizia glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered siris, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive, dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Albizia glomeriflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
