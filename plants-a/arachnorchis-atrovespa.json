    "intro": "Arachnorchis atrovespa, commonly known as the black-spurred orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and a distinctive, elongated spur that resembles a spider's leg, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, showcasing a complex mutualistic relationship. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
