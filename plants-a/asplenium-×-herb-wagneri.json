    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 herb-wagneri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring delicate, finely divided fronds with a dark green to bronze coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, humusy soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
