It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are found at the water's surface. Anthopterus pterotus is known for its carnivorous nature, supplementing its nutrient intake through the digestion of prey."
