    "intro": "Aspidium cyatheoides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in wetland and aquatic environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, feather-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
