    "intro": "Avena praecoqua, commonly known as early oat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Avena praecoqua is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to cool, moist environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
