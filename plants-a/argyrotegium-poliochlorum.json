It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia. Its bark is thick and corky, and it can grow as a tree or shrub depending on environmental conditions. Argyrotegium poliochlorum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
