    "intro": "Amphineuron immersum, commonly known as the submerged bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for capturing prey in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often appear as thread-like structures, while the vesicles are attached to the stems. Amphineuron immersum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality through its predatory activity."
