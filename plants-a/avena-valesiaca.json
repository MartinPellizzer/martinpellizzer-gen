    "intro": "Avena valesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesian oat, is a species of grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. Avena valesiaca thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
