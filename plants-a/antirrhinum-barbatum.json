It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a hairy appearance on the lower lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.
