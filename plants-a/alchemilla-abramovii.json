    "intro": "Alchemilla abramovii, commonly known as Abramov's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
