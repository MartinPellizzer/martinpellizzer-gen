It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Arabis excelsa thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
