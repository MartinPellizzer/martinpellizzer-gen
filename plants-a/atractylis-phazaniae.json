It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas and along waterways. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
