    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. indica, commonly known as Indian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including India and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its chemical composition makes it valuable in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
