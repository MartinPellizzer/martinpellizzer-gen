    "intro": "Acrostichum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often serrated fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in moist soil. The thick, fleshy leaves help it retain moisture, making it well adapted to its tropical habitat.",
