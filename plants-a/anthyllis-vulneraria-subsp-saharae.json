    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
