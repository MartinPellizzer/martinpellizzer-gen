    "intro": "Asarum lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of dark purple to brownish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic underground rhizome, which is the primary source of its medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
