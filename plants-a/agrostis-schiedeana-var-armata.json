    "intro": "Agrostis schiedeana var. armata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
