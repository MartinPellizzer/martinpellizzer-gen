The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Aster luxurifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
