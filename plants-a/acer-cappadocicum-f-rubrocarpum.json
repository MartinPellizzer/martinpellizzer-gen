    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. This plant is commonly found in rocky and mountainous areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. The subspecies is known for its distinctive red-brown foliage, which adds to its ornamental value. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions match its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its distinctive red foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and urban landscapes, particularly in the eastern and midwestern regions. This variety is valued for its autumn color and compact growth habit, making it suitable for smaller spaces. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts in natural habitats to control its spread."
