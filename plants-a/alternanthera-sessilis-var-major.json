It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is native to South America. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and pond edges."
