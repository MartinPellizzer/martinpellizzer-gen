    "intro": "Acer marsicum f. deflexum, commonly known as the Flexile maple, is a rare and unique variant of the maple tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping leaves that give it a cascading appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. Its foliage displays a striking color change from bright green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.",
