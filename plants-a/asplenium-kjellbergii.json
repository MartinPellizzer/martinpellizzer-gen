    "intro": "Asplenium kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium kjellbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
