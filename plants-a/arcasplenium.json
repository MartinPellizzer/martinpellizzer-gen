    "intro": "Arcasplenium, commonly known as the rock fig or creeping fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, simple leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plants produce small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Arcasplenium species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
