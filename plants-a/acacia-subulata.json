    "intro": "Acacia subulata, commonly known as the needle acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like phyllodes that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Acacia subulata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subulata is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the inland areas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region, with its small, needle-like leaves reducing water loss. Acacia subulata plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subulata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and deep root system. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for rehabilitation of mining sites and agricultural lands. Its introduction has helped restore vegetation cover in areas prone to desertification. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target habitats."
