    "intro": "Asclepias cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods and its showy, pinkish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals but is a vital food source for monarch butterfly larvae. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often reddish or purplish in color. Asclepias cornuta plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
