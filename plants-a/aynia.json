    "intro": "Aynia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh desert environment. Aynia typically grows from a bulbous stem and produces showy inflorescences during the dry season. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
