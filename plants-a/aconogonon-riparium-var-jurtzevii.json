It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. It is valued for its ability to stabilize riverbanks and provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.",
