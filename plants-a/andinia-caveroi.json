    "intro": "Andinia caveroi, commonly known as the Cavernous Nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
