It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and distinctive, wavy, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
