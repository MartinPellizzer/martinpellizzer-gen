    "intro": "Adonis volgensis, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal raceme, with petals that are narrowly bell-shaped. Adonis volgensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.",
