It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers with a yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are sword-shaped and form a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
