    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-shaped inflorescence, which is typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, commonly found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens.",
