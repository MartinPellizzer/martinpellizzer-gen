    "intro": "Adiantum capillatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble flowing hair, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum capillatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces.",
