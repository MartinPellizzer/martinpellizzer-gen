    "intro": "Adenophora leptosepala var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many other bellflowers. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with features that aid in moisture retention and light absorption.",
