    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa f. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with 8 to 16 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets, which are typically gray-green in color and have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, pea-like purple to violet flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it a beneficial addition to native plant gardens."
