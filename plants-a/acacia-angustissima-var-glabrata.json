    "intro": "Acacia angustissima var. glabrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often glabrous (hairless) phyllodes, which are typically dark green and narrow. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. glabrata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the regions of the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, gravelly soils, and dry, open habitats. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation types. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. glabrata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been established in various regions, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. It is commonly found in semi-arid and coastal areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Zimbabwe, as part of afforestation and rehabilitation projects. However, its invasive potential remains a topic of debate in some regions."
