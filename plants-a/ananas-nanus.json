    "intro": "Ananas nanus, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of stiff, spiky leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a small, edible fruit similar to the common pineapple but on a much smaller scale. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Ananas nanus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
