    "intro": "Adiantum malesianum, commonly known as the Malay maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often bronze or reddish in color when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through its habitat. The leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the wings of a bird, hence its common name.",
