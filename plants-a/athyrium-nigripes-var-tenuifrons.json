    "intro": "Athyrium nigripes var. tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady fern, is a fern species native to parts of East Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
