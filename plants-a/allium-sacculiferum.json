    "intro": "Allium sacculiferum, commonly known as the nutgrass or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes many edible and ornamental plants such as onions and garlic. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other Allium species. Allium sacculiferum is often found in moist, shady habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
