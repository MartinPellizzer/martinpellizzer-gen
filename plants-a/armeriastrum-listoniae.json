    "intro": "Armeriastrum listoniae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa Island sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its environment, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
