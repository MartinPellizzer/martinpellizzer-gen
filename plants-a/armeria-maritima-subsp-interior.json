    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It features dense clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
