    "intro": "Acalypha riedeliana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, veined leaves that range from green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha riedeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental foliage. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha riedeliana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several areas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along stream banks and in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora."
