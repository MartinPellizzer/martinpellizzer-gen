    "intro": "Antennaria aprica, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats. The plant features small, hairy stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Antennaria aprica is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
