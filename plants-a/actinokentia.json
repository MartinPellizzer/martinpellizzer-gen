    "intro": "Actinokentia, commonly known as the star-kentia, is a unique species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Actinokentia is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections."
