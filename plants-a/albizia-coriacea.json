    "intro": "Albizia coriacea, commonly known as the rough albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a rough texture due to the presence of small, raised dots on the leaf surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Albizia coriacea is adapted to poor soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodland edges. Its fibrous roots and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
