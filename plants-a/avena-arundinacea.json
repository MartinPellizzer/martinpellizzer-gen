    "intro": "Avena arundinacea, commonly known as false barley or wild oat, is a tall, perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. Avena arundinacea is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields, where it can become a weed."
