    "intro": "Agrimonia platycarpa, commonly known as common agrimony, is a flowering plant in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Agrimony has a long history of use in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
