    "intro": "Athyrium approximatum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through underground growth. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
