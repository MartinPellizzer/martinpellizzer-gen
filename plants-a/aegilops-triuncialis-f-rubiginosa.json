    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed wild oat, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along field edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in genetic research due to its unique genomic structure. Its fibrous stalks and seeds have also been used traditionally in some regions for fodder and minor agricultural purposes."
