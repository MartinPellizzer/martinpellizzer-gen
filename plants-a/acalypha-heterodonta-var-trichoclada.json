    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha heterodonta var. trichoclada is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This variant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It is adapted to warm, moist climates and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. Its native distribution reflects its preference for tropical and subtropical environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha heterodonta var. trichoclada was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or cargo. It thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological concern."
