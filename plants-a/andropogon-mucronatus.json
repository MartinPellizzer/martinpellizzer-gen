    "intro": "Andropogon mucronatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Andropogon mucronatus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
