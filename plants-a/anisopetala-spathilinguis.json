    "intro": "Anisopetala spathilinguis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically elongated and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Anisopetala spathilinguis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
