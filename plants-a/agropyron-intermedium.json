    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is often used in forage and conservation efforts."
