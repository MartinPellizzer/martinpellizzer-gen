    "intro": "Appendicula merrillii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It grows on the branches of native trees such as the ohia lehua, forming dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from its host, often leading to weakened or dying host plants. Despite its harmful effects, Appendicula merrillii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian forests."
