    "intro": "Anacheilium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima anacheilium, is a unique flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences. The plant thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of high-altitude rock formations. Its morphology includes slender stems and specialized aerial roots that help it anchor to rocky surfaces. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
