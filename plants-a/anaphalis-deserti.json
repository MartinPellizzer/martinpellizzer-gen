    "intro": "Anaphalis deserti, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its silver-gray foliage helps reduce water loss through reflective surfaces. Anaphalis deserti plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
