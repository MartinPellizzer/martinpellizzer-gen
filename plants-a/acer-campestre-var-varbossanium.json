    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. varbossanium is primarily native to southern and eastern Europe, including parts of Italy, France, Spain, and the Balkans. This variety of the common horse chestnut is found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. It typically grows in woodland edges, open areas, and along roadsides. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers slightly acidic to neutral conditions. Its native range extends into parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. varbossanium was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century during the period of European colonization. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
