    "intro": "Arbutus unedo, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to western Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tangy, sweet flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The strawberry tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local wildlife."
