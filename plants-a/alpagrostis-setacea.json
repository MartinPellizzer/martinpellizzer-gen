    "intro": "Alpagrostis setacea, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Alpagrostis setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
