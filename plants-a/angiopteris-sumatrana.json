    "intro": "Angiopteris sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Angiopteris sumatrana plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
