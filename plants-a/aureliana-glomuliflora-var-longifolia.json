    "intro": "Aureliana glomuliflora var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved globeflower, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, woolly coating, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
