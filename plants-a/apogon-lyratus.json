    "intro": "Apogon lyratus, commonly known as the singing fish plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized structures for gas exchange. It possesses a spongy, air-filled tissue called aerenchyma, which helps it float and facilitates oxygen diffusion. The plant's leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water movement and light absorption. It is native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in slow-moving streams and ponds. Apogon lyratus is often cultivated in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to purify water."
