    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus subsp. euphrasioides, commonly known as the Persian bugloss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
