    "intro": "Asplenium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or bipinnate, and often exhibit a range of shapes and sizes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium diversifolium is a hardy species that can thrive in a variety of microhabitats across temperate regions."
