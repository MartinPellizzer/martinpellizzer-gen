    "intro": "Aa maderoi, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa maderoi is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, forested areas with rich soil. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of the Andes and coastal lowlands. Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa maderoi was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions where it can outcompete native flora. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
