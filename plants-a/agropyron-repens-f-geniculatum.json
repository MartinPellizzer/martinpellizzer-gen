    "intro": "Agropyron repens f. geniculatum, commonly known as the geniculate grass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its low-growing habit and rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a useful plant for erosion control and forage."
