It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant as the seasons change. The leaves are typically smaller and more delicate compared to the standard red maple, with a distinctive red or reddish-brown coloration on the underside. This cultivar is often prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions.",
