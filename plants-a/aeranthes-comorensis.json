    "intro": "Aeranthes comorensis, commonly known as the Comoros violet, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Aeranthes comorensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
