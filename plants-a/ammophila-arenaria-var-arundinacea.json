    "intro": "Ammophila arenaria var. arundinacea, commonly known as the European beachgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes that help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for dune formation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in salty, well-drained environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it a key species in preventing erosion along shorelines."
