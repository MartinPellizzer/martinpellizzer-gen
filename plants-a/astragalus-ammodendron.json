    "intro": "Astragalus ammodendron, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and compound leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also used in restoration projects and traditional medicine."
