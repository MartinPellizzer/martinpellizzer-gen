    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 chasmophilum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, preferring shady, moist environments. The plant features narrow, dark green fronds with a leathery texture, often bearing spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the undersides of its leaves. Its hybrid nature results in variable morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Asplenium \u00d7 chasmophilum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
