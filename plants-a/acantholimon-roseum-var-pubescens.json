    "intro": "Acantholimon roseum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rose sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.",

It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in inland dunes. This plant thrives in coastal dune environments, often growing in open, sun-exposed areas. It is particularly associated with the southern parts of Western Australia and the Nullarbor Plain. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can tolerate high salinity and low moisture conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon roseum var. pubescens was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is typically associated with coastal dunes and inland deserts, where it thrives in full sun and low moisture conditions. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as landscaping and restoration projects. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in disturbed soils and along roadsides in these areas."
