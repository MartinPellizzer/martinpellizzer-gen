    "intro": "Acampe pachyglossa, commonly known as the broad-lipped acampe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in diverse habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and dry forests. Its distribution spans across multiple islands and mainland countries in eastern and southern Africa. The species is well adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe pachyglossa was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking blue and purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for garden settings. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Conservationists are monitoring its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
