    "intro": "Abronia maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the Atlantic coast. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.",

This plant is typically found in coastal areas, often in sandy or rocky habitats. It thrives in environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The subspecies is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia maritima subsp. maritima was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. This plant is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common species in maritime ecosystems. It is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
