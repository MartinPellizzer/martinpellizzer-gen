    "intro": "Apocynum odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its latex is milky and toxic, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. Apocynum odoratissimum plays a role in supporting pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
