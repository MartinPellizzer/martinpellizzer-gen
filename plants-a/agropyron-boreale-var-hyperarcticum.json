    "intro": "Agropyron boreale var. hyperarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. This plant thrives in cold, harsh environments with poor soil conditions, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range. Its ability to survive extreme cold and short growing seasons makes it an important component of polar ecosystems."
