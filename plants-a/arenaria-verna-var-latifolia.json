    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
