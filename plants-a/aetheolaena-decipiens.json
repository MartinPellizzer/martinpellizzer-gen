    "intro": "Aetheolaena decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive lily, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of other lilies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a fibrous root system. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often emerging from a bulbous base. Despite its attractive appearance, the plant is known for its deceptive nature, as it can be difficult to distinguish from similar species in the wild."
