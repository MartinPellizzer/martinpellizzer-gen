    "intro": "Angelica songorica, commonly known as the Bornean angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and finely divided leaves. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic and medicinal properties, containing compounds like essential oils and alkaloids. Angelica songorica is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though it remains relatively understudied compared to other members of its genus."
