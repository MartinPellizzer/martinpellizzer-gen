It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a wavy, undulating margin, which gives the species its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
