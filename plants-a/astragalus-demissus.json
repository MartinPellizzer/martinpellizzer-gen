    "intro": "Astragalus demissus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain the seeds. Astragalus demissus is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
