    "intro": "Aspidium schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct, elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Aspidium schomburgkii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
