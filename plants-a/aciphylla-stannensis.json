    "intro": "Aciphylla stannensis, commonly known as the Stann Creek aciphylla, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
