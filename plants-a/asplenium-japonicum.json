    "intro": "Asplenium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It is native to East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
