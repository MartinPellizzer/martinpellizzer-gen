    "intro": "Agropyron junceum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other wheatgrass varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
