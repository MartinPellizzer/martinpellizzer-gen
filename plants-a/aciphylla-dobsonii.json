    "intro": "Aciphylla dobsonii, commonly known as the Dobson's bristlebush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Aciphylla dobsonii plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds.",
