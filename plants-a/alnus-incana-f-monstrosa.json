    "intro": "Alnus incana f. monstrosa, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
