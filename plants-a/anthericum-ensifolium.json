    "intro": "Anthericum ensifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy green color. Anthericum ensifolium reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of its fronds."
