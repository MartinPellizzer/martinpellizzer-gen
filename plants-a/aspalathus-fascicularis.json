    "intro": "Aspalathus fascicularis, commonly known as the Natal tea or red bush willow, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native habitat."
