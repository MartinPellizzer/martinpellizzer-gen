    "intro": "Aster cordifolius var. sagittifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its foliage and flowering habits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
