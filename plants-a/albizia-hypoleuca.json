    "intro": "Albizia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white siris, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to parts of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in racemose inflorescences, typically in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that mature in the fall. Albizia hypoleuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
