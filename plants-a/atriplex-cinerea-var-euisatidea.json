It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that reduce water loss. The plant has small, green to reddish leaves that are often opposite or alternate in arrangement. It produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This species is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal landscapes."
