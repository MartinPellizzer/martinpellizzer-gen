It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus gymnolobus is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
