    "intro": "Alliaria flavescens, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces smooth, elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many regions."
