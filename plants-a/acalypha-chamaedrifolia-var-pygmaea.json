    "intro": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish or bronze underside, which adds visual interest to the plant. The species produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous but attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in small garden spaces or as a ground cover.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. The species is adapted to warm, moist climates and often grows in shaded undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, during a period of increased botanical exchange between Europe and the Pacific. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
