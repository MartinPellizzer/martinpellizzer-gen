    "intro": "Antennaria montana var. rubra, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with thin, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Antennaria montana var. rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-elevation ecosystems."
