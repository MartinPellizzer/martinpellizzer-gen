    "intro": "Alnus incana var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
