    "intro": "Actinea acaulis var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in a star-like pattern, often appearing in late summer. The variety lanata is distinguished by its more pronounced and dense pubescence compared to the typical form of Actinea acaulis.",
