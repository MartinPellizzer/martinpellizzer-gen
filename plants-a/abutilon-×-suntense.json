It is found in the northeastern regions of the country, including the states of Bahia, Piau\u00ed, and Cear\u00e1. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in forested areas and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with humid environments and is part of the Malvaceae family. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Brazil where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon \u00d7 suntense was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and unique foliage. It is commonly found in regions with warm, temperate climates, particularly in California and Florida. The plant has been cultivated in gardens and public landscapes for its aesthetic value. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive spread. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and garden plantings."
