    "intro": "Astragalus pinetorum var. drusorum, commonly known as the pine mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as pine forests and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in association with other drought-tolerant flora in its native range."
