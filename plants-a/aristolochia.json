    "intro": "Aristolochia, commonly known as Dutchman's pipe, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aristolochiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, pipe-shaped flowers that often resemble a twisted tube, with intricate patterns and colors that attract specific pollinators. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, and the plants can be shrubs or vines, depending on the species. Aristolochia species are native to various regions, including tropical and temperate areas of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. However, some species are toxic and contain aristolochic acids, which can be harmful to humans and animals."
