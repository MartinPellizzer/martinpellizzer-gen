    "intro": "Anthericum liliago subsp. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican lily, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It blooms in spring, producing clusters of small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
