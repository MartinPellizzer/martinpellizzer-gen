    "intro": "Aster gaspensis f. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower aster, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its most distinctive feature is its showy, white to pale pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
