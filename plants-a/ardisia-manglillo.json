    "intro": "Ardisia manglillo, commonly known as the manglillo flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ardisia manglillo thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
