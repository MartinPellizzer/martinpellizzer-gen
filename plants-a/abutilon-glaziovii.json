    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon glaziovii is primarily native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is found in regions such as southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry forests and shrublands. It is also present in countries like Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Its native distribution is closely associated with areas that have well-drained soils and a warm, semi-arid to humid climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon glaziovii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in parts of the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Arizona. The plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and cultivation efforts by plant enthusiasts. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown."
