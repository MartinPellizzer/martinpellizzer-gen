    "intro": "Asplundia xiphophylla, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that resemble a sword, with a long, narrow shape and a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Asplundia xiphophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
