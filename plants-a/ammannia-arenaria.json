    "intro": "Ammannia arenaria, commonly known as sand ammannia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ammannia arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
