    "intro": "Andriapetalum polystachyum, commonly known as the mountain glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant produces small, bisexual flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
