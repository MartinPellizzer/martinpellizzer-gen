    "intro": "Asclepias inflexa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, rounded seed pods. Asclepias inflexa is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators. Its latex contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, serving as a defense mechanism."
