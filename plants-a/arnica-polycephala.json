    "intro": "Arnica polycephala, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its hairy, rough leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant grows in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to survive in harsh conditions, and it is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that the plant is toxic if ingested and should not be used without professional guidance."
