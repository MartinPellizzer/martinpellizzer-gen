It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for coastal and arid landscapes."
