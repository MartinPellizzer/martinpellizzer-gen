    "intro": "Ajuga ovalifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale pink flowers in early to mid-summer. Its flowers are borne on slender stems that rise above the foliage, creating a delicate, cascading effect. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
