    "intro": "Achnatherum virescens, commonly known as green threadgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a characteristic elongated, cylindrical stem. Achnatherum virescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.",
