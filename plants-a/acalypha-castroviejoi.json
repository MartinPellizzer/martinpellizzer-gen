    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha castroviejoi is primarily native to Colombia. This species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and lowland areas. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its limited distribution highlights its ecological specificity and conservation importance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha castroviejoi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as agriculture and land clearing. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can quickly colonize abandoned fields and roadsides. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is now found in several countries across the Americas."
