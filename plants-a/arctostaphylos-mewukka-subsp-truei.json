    "intro": "Arctostaphylos mewukka subsp. truei, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky, arid environments. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and different leaf morphology compared to the main species."
