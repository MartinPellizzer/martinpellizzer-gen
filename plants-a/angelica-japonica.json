It features tall, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a strong, aromatic scent. The root of Angelica japonica is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
