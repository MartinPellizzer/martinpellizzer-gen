    "intro": "Alnus incana f. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the silky alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely pinnatisected leaves, which give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its fruit is a small, winged nutlet. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
