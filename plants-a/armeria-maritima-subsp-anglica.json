    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. anglica, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, needle-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Sea thrift is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
