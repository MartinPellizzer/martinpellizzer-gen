    "intro": "Angiopteris marginata, commonly known as the marginal sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive margin with a narrow, brownish edge, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its identification."
