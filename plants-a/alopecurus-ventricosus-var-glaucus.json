    "intro": "Alopecurus ventricosus var. glaucus, commonly known as the blue hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats. The blue hue of its foliage is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves, which reflects light."
