    "intro": "Allionia diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a silvery-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds."
