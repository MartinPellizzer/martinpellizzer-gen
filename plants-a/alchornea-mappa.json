It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a reddish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Alchornea mappa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
