It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clumping habit. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections."
