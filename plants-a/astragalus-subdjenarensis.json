    "intro": "Astragalus subdjenarensis, commonly known as the Subdjenarensis milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
