    "intro": "Acaena splendens var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf bull's-ear, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena splendens var. brachyphylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in subalpine and alpine environments. It is often associated with open vegetation types such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena splendens var. brachyphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This variety is known for its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the South Island. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive spread."
