    "intro": "Adenocalymma subspicatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its capsule fruits release seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. Adenocalymma subspicatum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal regions.",
