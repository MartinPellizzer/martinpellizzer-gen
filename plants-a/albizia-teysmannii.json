    "intro": "Albizia teysmannii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Albizia teysmannii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
