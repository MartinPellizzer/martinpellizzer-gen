    "intro": "Abrus canescens, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant has feathery leaves and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. Abrus canescens is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to a wide range of ecological conditions in sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus canescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive seed pods and vibrant seed colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its toxic seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its ecological impact."
