    "intro": "Astragalus badelehensis, commonly known as the Badeleh milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus badelehensis is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
