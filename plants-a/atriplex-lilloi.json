    "intro": "Atriplex lilloi, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Atriplex lilloi is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
