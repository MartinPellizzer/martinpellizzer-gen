It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without deriving nutrients from them. The botanical features of Acianthera chrysantha make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical research.",
