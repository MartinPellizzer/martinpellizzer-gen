    "intro": "Acampe excavata, commonly known as the African violets, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often forming a compact rosette structure.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe excavata is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought. Acampe excavata is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe excavata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and lowland areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local biodiversity."
