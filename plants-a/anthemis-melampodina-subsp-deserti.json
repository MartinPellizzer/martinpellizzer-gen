    "intro": "Anthemis melampodina subsp. deserti, commonly known as the desert cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
