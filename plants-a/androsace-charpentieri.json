    "intro": "Androsace charpentieri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain forests. Due to its delicate appearance and preference for cool, moist environments, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
