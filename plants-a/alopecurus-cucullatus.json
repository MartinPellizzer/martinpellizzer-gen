    "intro": "Alopecurus cucullatus, commonly known as the hooded grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus cucullatus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in grassland ecosystems."
