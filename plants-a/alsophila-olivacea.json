    "intro": "Alsophila olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bright green fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a smooth, waxy surface that reflects light. Alsophila olivacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shaded, moist environments."
