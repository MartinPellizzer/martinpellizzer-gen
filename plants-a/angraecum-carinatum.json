    "intro": "Angraecum carinatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, zigzag-shaped inflorescence and vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum carinatum is a popular choice for collectors due to its ornamental value and unusual appearance."
