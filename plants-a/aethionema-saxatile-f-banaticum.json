    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile f. banaticum, commonly known as the Banat rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
