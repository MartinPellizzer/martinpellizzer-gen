    "intro": "Angiopteris badia, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments, typically near streams or in swampy areas. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, wavy margin. Angiopteris badia plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
