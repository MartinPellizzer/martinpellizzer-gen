It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, leathery leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with multiple layers of small, toothed pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and tropical landscapes.",
