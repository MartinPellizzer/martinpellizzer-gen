    "intro": "Actinidia vitifolia, commonly known as the grape-leaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Actinidia vitifolia is also valued for its role in traditional Chinese medicine.",
