    "intro": "Achlaena, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow flowers that resemble those of true dandelions. Achlaena species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
