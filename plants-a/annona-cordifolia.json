    "intro": "Annona cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf ackee, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and large, fragrant flowers that are typically white or greenish-white. The plant produces a fruit that resembles a small, green apple, which turns yellow when ripe. The fruit contains a single large, white, egg-shaped seed surrounded by a fleshy, sweet pulp. Annona cordifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
