    "intro": "Athyrium tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through the soil. Athyrium tenuicaule is valued for its ornamental foliage and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
