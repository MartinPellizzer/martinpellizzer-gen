    "intro": "Aegopodium alpestre, commonly known as alpine ground-elder, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered with fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Aegopodium alpestre is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
