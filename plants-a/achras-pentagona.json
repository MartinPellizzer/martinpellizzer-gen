    "intro": "Achras pentagona, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pentagonal leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a sticky, latex-rich pulp. Its latex has historically been used to make chewing gum and is also valued for its medicinal properties. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
