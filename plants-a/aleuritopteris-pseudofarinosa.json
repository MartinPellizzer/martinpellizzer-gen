    "intro": "Aleuritopteris pseudofarinosa, commonly known as the Japanese cliff fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or cliffs. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Aleuritopteris pseudofarinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
