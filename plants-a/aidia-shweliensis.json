    "intro": "Aidia shweliensis, commonly known as the Shweli Aidia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aidia shweliensis is considered a vulnerable species."
