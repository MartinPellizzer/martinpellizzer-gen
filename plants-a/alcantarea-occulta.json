    "intro": "Alcantarea occulta, commonly known as the hidden alcantara, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Alcantarea occulta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
