It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
