    "intro": "Asplenium petiolulatum var. longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds that are often adorned with long, slender pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense, low-growing colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in suitable conditions."
