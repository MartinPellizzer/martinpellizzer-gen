    "intro": "Actinidia maloides f. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf actinidia, is a unique variant of the actinidia genus native to China. This plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name and distinguish it from other species in the genus. It is a deciduous vine that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study.",
