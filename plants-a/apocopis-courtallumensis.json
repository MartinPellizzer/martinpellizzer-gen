    "intro": "Apocopis courtallumensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the rainy season. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
