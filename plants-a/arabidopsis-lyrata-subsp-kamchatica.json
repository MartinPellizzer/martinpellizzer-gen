    "intro": "Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. kamchatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of eastern Siberia and the Far East. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, exhibiting a compact growth habit and hairy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of slender, elongated seed pods. The plant is often used in ecological studies due to its genetic similarity to the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana."
