    "intro": "Agonis theiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeywood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Agonis theiformis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
