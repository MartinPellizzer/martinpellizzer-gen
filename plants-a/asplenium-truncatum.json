    "intro": "Asplenium truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and woodland floors. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often cut or notched at the base, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium truncatum is generally hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
