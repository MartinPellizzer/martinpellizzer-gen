    "intro": "Acer caudatum subsp. prattii, commonly known as the Pratts' maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading branches that give it a weeping appearance, and its leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage changes to vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental tree. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer caudatum subsp. prattii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Nevada. It is found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This subspecies is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests and chaparral habitats. It prefers cool, humid climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caudatum subsp. prattii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its distinctive red foliage in the fall. It has been planted in both natural and cultivated landscapes due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native habitats."
