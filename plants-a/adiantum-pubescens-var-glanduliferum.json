    "intro": "Adiantum pubescens var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular maidenhair fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. This variety is prized for its aesthetic value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.",
