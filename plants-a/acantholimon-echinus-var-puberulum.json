    "intro": "Acantholimon echinus var. puberulum, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon echinus var. puberulum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It thrives in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is commonly found in dunes, coastal bluffs, and open grasslands. It prefers full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can survive with minimal water availability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon echinus var. puberulum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. It is also valued for its ornamental appearance, with its distinctive spiny foliage and flowering stems. Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for landscaping and ecological restoration purposes."
