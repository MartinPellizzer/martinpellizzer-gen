    "intro": "Agrostis rockii, commonly known as the Rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three flowers. Agrostis rockii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
