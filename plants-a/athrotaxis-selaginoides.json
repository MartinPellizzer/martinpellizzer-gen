    "intro": "Athrotaxis selaginoides, commonly known as the coastal tanglewood, is a unique evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tangled growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
