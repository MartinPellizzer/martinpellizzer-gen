    "intro": "Andromeda frondosa, commonly known as the Atlantic pine or the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils along coastal areas and rocky outcrops. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Andromeda frondosa is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
