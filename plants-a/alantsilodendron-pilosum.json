    "intro": "Alantsilodendron pilosum, commonly known as the silky ash tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, finely hairy leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
