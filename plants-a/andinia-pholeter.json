    "intro": "Andinia pholeter, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark red heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a dense canopy with broad, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody fruits containing small, round seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
