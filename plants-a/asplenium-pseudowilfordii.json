    "intro": "Asplenium pseudowilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in dense, rosette-like formations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium pseudowilfordii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
