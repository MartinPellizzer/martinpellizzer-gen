    "intro": "Anthurium littorale, commonly known as the coastal anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces vibrant spadices, which are the characteristic inflorescences of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium littorale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
