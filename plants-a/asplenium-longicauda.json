    "intro": "Asplenium longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive elongated spur at the base of the leaf stalk. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Asplenium longicauda is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability."
