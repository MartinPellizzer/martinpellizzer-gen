    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
