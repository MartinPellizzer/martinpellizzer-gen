    "intro": "Antennaria arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
