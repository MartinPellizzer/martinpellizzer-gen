    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its glandular structures on the leaves and stems contribute to its ability to survive in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
