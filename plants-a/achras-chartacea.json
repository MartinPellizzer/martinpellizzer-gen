    "intro": "Achras chartacea, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a fruit that is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The plant has a sturdy trunk with a thick, fibrous bark and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The fruit, which is rich in carbohydrates, is a vital food source in many island communities.",
