    "intro": "Andreettaea tempestalis, commonly known as the stormy Andreetta, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a crown, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports a variety of microorganisms and insects. Its flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Andreettaea tempestalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
