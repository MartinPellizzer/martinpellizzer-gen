    "intro": "Arabis sachokiana, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Arabis sachokiana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate cold and poor soil conditions."
