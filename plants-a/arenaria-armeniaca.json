    "intro": "Arenaria armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
