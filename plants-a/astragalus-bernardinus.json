    "intro": "Astragalus bernardinus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some areas."
