    "intro": "Anthemis incrassata, commonly known as the rough anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally gray-green with a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The species is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
