    "intro": "Andropogon macrourus var. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy big bluestem, is a variant of the big bluestem grass native to the central United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth and coarse, hairy leaves that give it its common name. This grass thrives in prairie habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Its flowering stalks produce panicles of small, blue-gray florets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting wildlife in native grassland ecosystems."
