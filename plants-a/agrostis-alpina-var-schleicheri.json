    "intro": "Agrostis alpina var. schleicheri, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and mountainous regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged landscapes."
