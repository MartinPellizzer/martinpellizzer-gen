    "intro": "Axonopus paniceus, commonly known as flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses. The plant is typically found in moist, low-lying areas such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Axonopus paniceus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
