    "intro": "Arabis nana, commonly known as the giant rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arabis nana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
