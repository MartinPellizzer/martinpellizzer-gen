It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent purple veins and a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a unique corm that serves as its underground storage organ. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs."
