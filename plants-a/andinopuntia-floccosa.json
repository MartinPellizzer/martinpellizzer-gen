    "intro": "Andinopuntia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly cholla, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems covered in a white, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a notable species in the Cactaceae family."
