    "intro": "Agave theoxmuliana, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent plant native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native environment. Agave theoxmuliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
