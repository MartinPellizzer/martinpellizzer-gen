    "intro": "Astilbe, commonly known as false spirea, is a genus of about 180 species of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. These herbaceous perennials are native to Asia, eastern North America, and the Caribbean, and they thrive in shady, moist environments. Astilbe plants are characterized by their plume-like inflorescences, which come in shades of white, pink, and red, and their finely divided, fern-like leaves. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to add color to woodland gardens. Astilbe species are relatively easy to grow and require well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
