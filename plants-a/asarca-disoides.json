    "intro": "Asarca disoides, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy white or pale pink flower with a distinctive hooded lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base. Asarca disoides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
