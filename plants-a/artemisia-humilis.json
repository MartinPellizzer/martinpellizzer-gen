    "intro": "Artemisia humilis, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The essential oils from its leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their aromatic and antimicrobial properties."
