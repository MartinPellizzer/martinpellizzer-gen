This plant is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas across these regions. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. Acanthus hirsutus is often seen growing in limestone formations and along cliffs. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the specific environmental conditions of the eastern Mediterranean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus hirsutus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly used in gardens and as a decorative plant in urban environments. The plant has been introduced to various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Careful management is often required to prevent its spread in non-native habitats."
