    "intro": "Acacia zatrichota, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or disturbed soils. Acacia zatrichota is also known for its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia zatrichota is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Acacia zatrichota plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia zatrichota was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming naturalized in several areas. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it provides shade and attracts wildlife. However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions."
