    "intro": "Artemisia baumgartenii subsp. eriantha, commonly known as the woolly artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
