    "intro": "Athyrium silvaticum, commonly known as the forest fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium silvaticum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
