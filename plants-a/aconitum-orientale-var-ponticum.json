    "intro": "Aconitum orientale var. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, hooded blue-violet flowers that are typically arranged in tall, sparsely branched clusters. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and its stems are covered in stiff, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often grown in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
