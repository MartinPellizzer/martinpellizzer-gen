    "intro": "Anemone trullifolia var. lutienensis, commonly known as the Lutien anemone, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Alps. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
