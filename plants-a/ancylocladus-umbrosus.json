It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has dark, almost black bark and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ancylocladus umbrosus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
