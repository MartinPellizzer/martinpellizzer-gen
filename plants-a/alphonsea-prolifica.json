    "intro": "Alphonsea prolifica, commonly known as the tropical moonseed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often consumed by birds and other animals. Alphonsea prolifica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
