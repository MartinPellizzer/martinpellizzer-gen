    "intro": "Acalypha subtomentosa, commonly known as silky abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and prefers well-drained soil. Acalypha subtomentosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subtomentosa is primarily native to Mexico Central. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests. Its distribution is limited to specific parts of Mexico Central, where it grows in lowland and montane regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subtomentosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island ecosystems."
