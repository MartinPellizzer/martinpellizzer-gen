    "intro": "Angelonia hirta, commonly known as the winter angel or red hot poker, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and purple. The plant produces numerous small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Angelonia hirta is also valued for its long blooming period, which can extend from spring through fall in suitable climates."
