    "intro": "Asplenium lonchophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium lonchophyllum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
