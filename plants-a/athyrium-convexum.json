    "intro": "Athyrium convexum, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream sides. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Athyrium convexum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
