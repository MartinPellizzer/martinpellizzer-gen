    "intro": "Arisaema chauvanminhii, commonly known as the Chau Van Minh arisaema, is a rare and endemic species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
