    "intro": "Astronia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty astronia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its rough, reddish-brown bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Astronia ferruginea is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or limestone soils."
