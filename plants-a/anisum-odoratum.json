    "intro": "Anisum odoratum, commonly known as sweet fennel, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its feathery, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. The plant is native to southern Europe and western Asia and thrives in temperate climates. It is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its distinctive licorice-like aroma is due to the presence of compounds such as anethol and fenchone."
