    "intro": "Amaryllis machupijchensis, commonly known as the Machupijchi amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional Andean crafts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of dormancy to encourage blooming. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
