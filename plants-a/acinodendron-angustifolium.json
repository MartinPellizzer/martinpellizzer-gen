It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks.",
