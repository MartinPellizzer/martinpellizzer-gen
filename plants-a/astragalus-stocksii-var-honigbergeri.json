    "intro": "Astragalus stocksii var. honigbergeri, commonly known as Honigberger's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
