    "intro": "Aconitum bulbilliferum, commonly known as the bulblet aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that bear large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its stem, which are small, vegetative propagules that can develop into new plants. These bulbils are an important feature for its propagation and survival in its natural habitat. Aconitum bulbilliferum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially hazardous plant to handle.",
