    "intro": "Aesculus barbata, commonly known as the barbed horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobed and have a distinctive barbed texture on the underside. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels during late spring, followed by spiny, orange-brown fruits that contain one to three seeds. Its botanical features make it a notable ornamental plant, though it is less commonly cultivated than other horse chestnut species. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
