It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Anthyllis aurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
