It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The flowers bloom from spring to autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
