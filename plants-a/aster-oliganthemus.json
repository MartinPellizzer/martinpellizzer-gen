    "intro": "Aster oliganthemus, commonly known as the few-flowered aster, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
