    "intro": "Austrobuxus cracens, commonly known as the Australian boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Buxaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for topiary and ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to maintain shape. Austrobuxus cracens is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
