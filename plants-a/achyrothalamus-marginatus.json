The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.",
