    "intro": "Agropyron scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its seed heads are spike-like and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Agropyron scabrifolium is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
