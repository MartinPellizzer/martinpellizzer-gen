    "intro": "Asplenium stellatum, commonly known as the star fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds that resemble stars. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal. Asplenium stellatum requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
