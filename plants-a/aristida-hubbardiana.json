    "intro": "Aristida hubbardiana, commonly known as the Hubbard's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces small, three-awned spikelets that are distinctive in appearance. This grass is drought-tolerant and often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
