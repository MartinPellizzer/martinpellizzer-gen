    "intro": "Alopecurus agrestis var. viridis, commonly known as green field mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white spikelets that form clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its presence is an indicator of nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
