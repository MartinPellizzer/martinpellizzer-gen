    "intro": "Aspalathus microdon, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant is well adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is primarily cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce the popular herbal tea known as rooibos. The plant's unique botanical features make it an important component of the fynbos biome."
