It is a member of the Myrtle family (Myrtaceae) and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Ardisia hospitans typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal fruiting."
