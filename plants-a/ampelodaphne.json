    "intro": "Ampelodaphne, commonly known as the hanging sycamore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. These plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves and fragrant, often aromatic flowers. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Ampelodaphne species often have woody stems that can grow in a cascading or hanging manner, which contributes to their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their aesthetic appeal and potential medicinal properties."
