    "intro": "Androsace occidentalis var. simplex, commonly known as the western mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and adaptability to harsh environments, it is a valued plant in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
