    "intro": "Arctium refractum, commonly known as the brittle burdock, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The leaves and roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
