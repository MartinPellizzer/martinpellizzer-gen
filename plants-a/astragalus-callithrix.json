    "intro": "Astragalus callithrix, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus callithrix plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
