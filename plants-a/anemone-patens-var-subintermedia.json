    "intro": "Anemone patens var. subintermedia, commonly known as the spreading anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
