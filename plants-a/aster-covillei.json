    "intro": "Aster covillei, commonly known as the Coville's aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Aster covillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
