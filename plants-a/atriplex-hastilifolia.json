It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt flats, and deserts. Atriplex hastilifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
