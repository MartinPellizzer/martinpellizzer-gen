    "intro": "Artemisia herriotii, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Artemisia herriotii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
