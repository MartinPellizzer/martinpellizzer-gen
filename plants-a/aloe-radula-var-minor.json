    "intro": "Aloe radula var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
