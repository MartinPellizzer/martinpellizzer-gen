    "intro": "Acacia rhamphophylla, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open when mature. Acacia rhamphophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rhamphophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the region's arid and semi-arid zones. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rhamphophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often along the edges of forests and in open woodlands. The plant is known for its distinctive, flat, feather-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is used in traditional medicine and has also been introduced for ornamental purposes in gardens. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems."
