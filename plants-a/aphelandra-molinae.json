    "intro": "Aphelandra molinae, commonly known as the silverleaf flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orange-red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra molinae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded to semi-shaded conditions."
