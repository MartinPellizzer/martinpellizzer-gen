    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with ovate, toothed leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
