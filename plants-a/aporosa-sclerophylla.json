    "intro": "Aporosa sclerophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved aporosa, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often glandular leaves that are adapted to withstand dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of bark, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Aporosa sclerophylla is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
