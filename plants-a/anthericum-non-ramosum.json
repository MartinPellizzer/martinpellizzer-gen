    "intro": "Anthericum non-ramosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall, spike of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
