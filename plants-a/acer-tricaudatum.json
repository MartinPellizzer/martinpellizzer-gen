    "intro": "Acer tricaudatum, commonly known as the three-tailed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Acer tricaudatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure.",
