    "intro": "Arabis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and succulent, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Arabis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
