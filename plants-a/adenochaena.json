    "intro": "Adenochaena, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive velvety texture. Adenochaena species typically produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. They are often found in disturbed habitats and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
