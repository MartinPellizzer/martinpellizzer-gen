    "intro": "Averia melanosperma, commonly known as the black-seeded grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dark brown seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Averia melanosperma is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures."
