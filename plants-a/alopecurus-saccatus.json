    "intro": "Alopecurus saccatus, commonly known as the scaly oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, scaly bract, which gives the species its scientific name. Alopecurus saccatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
