    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha giraldii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern region. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is commonly seen in secondary vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha giraldii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it an aggressive colonizer. However, it is not typically considered invasive in its native range."
