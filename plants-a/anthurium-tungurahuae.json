    "intro": "Anthurium tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua arrowroot, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. Its flowers are typically yellowish-green, with a central spadix that bears tiny, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
