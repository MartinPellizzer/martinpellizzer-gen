    "intro": "Alsophila radens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and silvery-white underneath, contributing to its common name. Alsophila radens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
