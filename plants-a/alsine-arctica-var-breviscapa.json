    "intro": "Alsine arctica var. breviscapa, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
