It features rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
