    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina var. polysporum, commonly known as the Polysporous Shield Fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid conditions and is often found in woodland areas or on rocky outcrops. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to low-light, high-moisture habitats, making it a resilient and ornamental species."
