    "intro": "Arenaria pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arenaria pitcheri plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dune sands and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
