    "intro": "Anemia tomentosa var. oblonga, commonly known as the woolly anemia or woolly senna, is a perennial shrub native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
