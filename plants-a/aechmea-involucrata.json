    "intro": "Aechmea involucrata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spiky flower spikes that range in color from red to orange, often resembling a pinecone. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and the plant thrives in bright, indirect light. Aechmea involucrata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
