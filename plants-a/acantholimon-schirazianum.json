    "intro": "Acantholimon schirazianum, commonly known as the Schirazian's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in high-altitude areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon schirazianum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and high altitudes, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with limited rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, where it has adapted to the harsh climate. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its ability to survive in extreme conditions. However, it is not native to these areas and has been spread through human activity."
