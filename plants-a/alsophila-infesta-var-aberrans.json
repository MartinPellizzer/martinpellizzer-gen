    "intro": "Alsophila infesta var. aberrans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
