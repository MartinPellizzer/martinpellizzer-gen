    "intro": "Asteropeia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Asteropeia bakeri is adapted to harsh, arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
