    "intro": "Astragalus saxifractor, commonly known as the rock spurge or saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Astragalus saxifractor is known for its hardy nature and is often found in high-altitude habitats where few plants can survive."
