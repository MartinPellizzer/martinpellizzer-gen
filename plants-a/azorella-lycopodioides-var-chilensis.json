    "intro": "Azorella lycopodioides var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to the southern regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
