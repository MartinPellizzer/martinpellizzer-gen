    "intro": "Angraecum acutipetalum var. analabeensis, commonly known as the Analabeensis Angraecum, is a rare orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are predominantly white with intricate, spurred petals, adapted for pollination by moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
