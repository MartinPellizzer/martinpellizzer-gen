    "intro": "Ascarina lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved k\u014dhanga, is a distinctive member of the palm family (Arecaceae). It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, often forming dense thickets. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ascarina lanceolata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various native wildlife species."
