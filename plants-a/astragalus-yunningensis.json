    "intro": "Astragalus yunningensis, commonly known as Yunnan milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Astragalus species. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
