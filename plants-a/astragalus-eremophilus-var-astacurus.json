    "intro": "Astragalus eremophilus var. astacurus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
