    "intro": "Allium bolanderi var. stenanthum, commonly known as the Bolander's garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other allium species. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native range."
