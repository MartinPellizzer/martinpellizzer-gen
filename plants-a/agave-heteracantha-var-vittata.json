    "intro": "Agave heteracantha var. vittata, commonly known as the striped agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often lined with white or yellowish stripes. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk with small, greenish-white flowers, which appear after several years of growth. Its leaves are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating, and it is well adapted to arid environments. This species is popular in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
