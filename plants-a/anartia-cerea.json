    "intro": "Anartia cerea, commonly known as the white-spotted charaxes, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its distinctive white spots on the wings. The plant is not a botanical entity but a butterfly species, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its botanical features. I can't reply."
