It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its strong scent, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
