    "intro": "Allophylus robustus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alder, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds. Allophylus robustus thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
