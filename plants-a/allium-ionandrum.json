    "intro": "Allium ionandrum, commonly known as the desert leek, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal leaves that are broad, fleshy, and often bluish-green in color, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is typically covered in a thin, papery sheath. Allium ionandrum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
