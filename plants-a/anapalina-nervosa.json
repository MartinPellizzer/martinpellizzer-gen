    "intro": "Anapalina nervosa, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a member of the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are covered in a dense network of root hairs, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its leaves are divided into small, lance-shaped segments and are highly sensitive to touch, folding up when disturbed. Anapalina nervosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
