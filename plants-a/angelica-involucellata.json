    "intro": "Angelica involucellata, commonly known as the clustered angelica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its tall, slender stems can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Angelica involucellata is also known for its aromatic, slightly spicy scent and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
