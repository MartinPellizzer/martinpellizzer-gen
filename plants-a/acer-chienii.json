This species is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with distinctive leaves that change color in the fall. Its native range is limited to this specific region, making it a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer chienii was mainly introduced to the eastern and central regions of the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and adaptability to temperate climates. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements. This species has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks, contributing to biodiversity in non-native habitats. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on local ecosystems. Despite these concerns, Acer chienii remains a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable growing conditions."
