    "intro": "Amorphophallus ravenii, commonly known as the titan arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for its massive, phallic-shaped inflorescence, which can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant's flowers are unique, consisting of a large, dark purple outer spathe that encloses a spadix containing both male and female flowers. The titan arum is also notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which resembles rotting meat and attracts carrion-eating insects for pollination. Due to its rarity and the dramatic nature of its bloom, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
