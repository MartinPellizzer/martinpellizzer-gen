    "intro": "Anthericum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant's inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It blooms in late spring to early summer, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
