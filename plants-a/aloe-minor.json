    "intro": "Aloe minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers on tall, branched stalks during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive. Aloe minor is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing gel-like substance."
