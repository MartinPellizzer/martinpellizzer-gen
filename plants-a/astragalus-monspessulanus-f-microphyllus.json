    "intro": "Astragalus monspessulanus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branched stems that grow from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The leaves are pinnate, with small, rounded leaflets that give it its \"microphyllus\" designation. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and it produces legume-like pods that contain several seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
