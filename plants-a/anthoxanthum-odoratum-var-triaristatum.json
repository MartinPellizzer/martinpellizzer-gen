    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. triaristatum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive, aromatic leaves that emit a sweet, honey-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
