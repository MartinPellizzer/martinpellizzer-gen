    "intro": "Acaena microphylla subsp. eumicrophylla, commonly known as the small-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that contain numerous seeds enclosed in a fibrous, burr-like structure. These berries are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas, forest margins, and rocky soils.",

This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, such as coastal areas, forest margins, and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with the eastern and southern regions of New Zealand. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is an important component of native vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla subsp. eumicrophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and animals. Its establishment has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
