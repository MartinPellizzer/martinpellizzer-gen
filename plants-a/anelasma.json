    "intro": "Anelasma, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Anelasma has a unique reproductive system, relying on spores rather than seeds for propagation. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying rare plant adaptations."
