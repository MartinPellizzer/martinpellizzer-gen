    "intro": "Attalea speciosa, commonly known as the palm heart or pequi, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and a robust, clustered inflorescence. The plant produces edible fruits that are rich in oils and are used in traditional cuisines. Its trunk is often harvested for its starchy, edible pith, which is a key component in various regional dishes. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to forest ecosystems."
