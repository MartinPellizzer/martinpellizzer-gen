    "intro": "Agrostophyllum flexuosum subsp. flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of fine, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
