    "intro": "Aloe longistyla, commonly known as the long-stemmed aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, narrow, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are fleshy, lance-shaped, and covered in a layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Aloe longistyla is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
