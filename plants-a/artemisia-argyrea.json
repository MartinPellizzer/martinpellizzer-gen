    "intro": "Artemisia argyrea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia argyrea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
