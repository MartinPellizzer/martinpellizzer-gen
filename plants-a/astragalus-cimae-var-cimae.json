    "intro": "Astragalus cimae var. cimae, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
