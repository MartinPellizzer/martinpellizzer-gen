    "intro": "Aquilegia eximia, commonly known as the eximia columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It features striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow, arranged in a distinctive cup-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Aquilegia eximia is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
