    "intro": "Avena sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Avena sibthorpii is adapted to harsh, arid environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
