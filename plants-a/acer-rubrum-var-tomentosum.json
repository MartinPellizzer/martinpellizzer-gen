    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a variant of the red maple tree characterized by its distinctive fuzzy or pubescent leaves. The leaves are typically oval or ovate, with a serrated margin and a reddish or bronze hue on the underside. It is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse in the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it is less common than the typical red maple.",
