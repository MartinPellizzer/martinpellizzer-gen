    "intro": "Anthemis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
