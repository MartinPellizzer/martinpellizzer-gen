    "intro": "Aspidium stipulare, commonly known as the serrate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium stipulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
