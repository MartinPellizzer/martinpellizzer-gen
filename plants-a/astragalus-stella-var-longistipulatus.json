    "intro": "Astragalus stella var. longistipulatus, commonly known as the long-stippled milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, stiff leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Its scientific name reflects its close relation to the species *Astragalus stella* and its distinctive, elongated stipules."
