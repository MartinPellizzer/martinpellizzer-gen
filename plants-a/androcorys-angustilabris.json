    "intro": "Androcorys angustilabris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and showy, often violet or purple-colored blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
