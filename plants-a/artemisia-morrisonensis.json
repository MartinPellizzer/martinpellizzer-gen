    "intro": "Artemisia morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a strong, aromatic scent. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, often resinous foliage. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates."
