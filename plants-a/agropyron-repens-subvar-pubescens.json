    "intro": "Agropyron repens subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. This subspecies is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
