    "intro": "Astragalus anodiophilus, commonly known as the sweetroot or honeyvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus anodiophilus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
