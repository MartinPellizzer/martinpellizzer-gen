    "intro": "Agave hartmanii, commonly known as Hartman's agave, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. This plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Agave hartmanii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
