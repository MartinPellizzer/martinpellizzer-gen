    "intro": "Aquilegia cazorlensis, commonly known as the Cazorla bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of doubly pinnate leaves with finely divided lobes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
