    "intro": "Anemone patens var. flaccida, commonly known as the drooping anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and often droop downward, giving it its common name. It prefers moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
