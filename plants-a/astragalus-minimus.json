It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus minimus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
