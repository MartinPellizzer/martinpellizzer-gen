    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. subimberbis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved alder, is a variant of the common alder native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, often glabrous leaves and small, spherical cones. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Its leaves are typically oval to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
