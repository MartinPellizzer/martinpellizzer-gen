    "intro": "Aleuritopteris rosulata, commonly known as the rosette fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-like arrangement of fronds, which form a compact, circular pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's intricate frond structure and reproductive features make it an important subject in botanical studies."
