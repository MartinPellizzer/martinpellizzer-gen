    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens var. decumbens, commonly known as carpet bugle or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are heart-shaped, glossy, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
