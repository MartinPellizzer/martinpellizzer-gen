    "intro": "Arachniodes aspidioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China, and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant features intricate, shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, lace-like appearance, giving it a decorative and ornamental appeal. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats or clumps over time. Arachniodes aspidioides is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
