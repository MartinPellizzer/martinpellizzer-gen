    "intro": "Artemisia stricta var. diffusa, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
