    "intro": "Arachne colchica, commonly known as the Caucasian colchic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking, large, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, helmet-shaped seed pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Arachne colchica is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
