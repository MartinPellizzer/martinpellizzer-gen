It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as cliffs or slopes. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including poor soil and limited moisture.
