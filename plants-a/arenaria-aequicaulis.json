    "intro": "Arenaria aequicaulis, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed areas. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Arenaria aequicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
