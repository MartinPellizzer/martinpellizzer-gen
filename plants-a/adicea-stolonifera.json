    "intro": "Adicea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with horizontal stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are composed of five petals and are arranged in clusters. Adicea stolonifera is often found in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows.",
