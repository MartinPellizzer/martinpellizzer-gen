    "intro": "Angelphytum, commonly known as the desert angel or angel's flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in hot, dry climates. Angelphytum species are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The plants have a shallow root system and are adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
