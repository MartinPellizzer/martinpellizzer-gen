    "intro": "Aechmea polystachya var. excavata, commonly known as the \"Cupua\u00e7u\" bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and provides a habitat for small organisms. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to several feet in length. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
