    "intro": "Aidia wattii, commonly known as the wattii aidia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Aidia wattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
