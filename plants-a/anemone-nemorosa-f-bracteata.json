    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted wood anemone, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy. It produces small, green bracts beneath its flowers, which are modified leaves that help protect the flower buds. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and its role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
