    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris f. virgatoramosa, commonly known as the Virgin's Bells, is a botanical variant of the common columbine. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to violet, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with palmately divided, compound leaves that are typically green and lobed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and attractive seed pods that persist into autumn."
