    "intro": "Althaea macroclada, commonly known as the large-flowered mallows, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its fibrous roots have been historically used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Althaea macroclada is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
