    "intro": "Astragalus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus divaricatus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
