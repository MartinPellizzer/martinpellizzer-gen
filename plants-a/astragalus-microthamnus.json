It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments, contributing to soil stabilization. Astragalus microthamnus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
