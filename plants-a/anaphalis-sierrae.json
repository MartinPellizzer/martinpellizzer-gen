    "intro": "Anaphalis sierrae, commonly known as Sierra Fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that are often mistaken for cotton due to their soft, downy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. Anaphalis sierrae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
