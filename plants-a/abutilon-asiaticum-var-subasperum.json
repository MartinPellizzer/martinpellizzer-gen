    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon asiaticum var. subasperum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is typically associated with forest understories and riverbanks, where it thrives in humid conditions. The species is known for its hairy, rough-textured leaves and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the warm, humid climates of Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon asiaticum var. subasperum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has established populations in disturbed areas and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion of native habitats."
