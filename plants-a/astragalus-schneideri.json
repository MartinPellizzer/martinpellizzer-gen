    "intro": "Astragalus schneideri, commonly known as Schneider's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Nevada and California. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with small, compound leaves and yellow or white pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus schneideri plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
