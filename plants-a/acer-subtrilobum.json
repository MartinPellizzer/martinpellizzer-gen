    "intro": "Acer subtrilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often have a reddish or bronze hue in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant seasonal color changes.",
