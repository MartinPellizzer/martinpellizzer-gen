    "intro": "Anacyclus \u00d7 dissimilis, commonly known as the hybrid desert dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions. Anacyclus \u00d7 dissimilis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in desert landscapes."
