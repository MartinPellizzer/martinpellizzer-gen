It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fluffy center that resembles a puffball. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and provide a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
