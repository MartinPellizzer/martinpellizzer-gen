The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often loosely arranged. Due to its indeterminate classification, its exact taxonomic placement remains uncertain, making it a subject of ongoing botanical study."
