    "intro": "Anthriscus, commonly known as cow parsley, is a genus of flowering plants in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that form umbrella-shaped clusters. These plants are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Anthriscus species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some are annuals, and they are known for their aromatic foliage. The genus includes several species, such as Anthriscus sylvestris and Anthriscus caucasicus, which are sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
