    "intro": "Alchemilla pratensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a distinctive white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland areas. Lady's mantle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
