    "intro": "Aristolochia mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
