It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
