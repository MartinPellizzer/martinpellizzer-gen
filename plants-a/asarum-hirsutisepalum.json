    "intro": "Asarum hirsutisepalum, commonly known as the hairy-sepal asarum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, preferring cool and humid environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are small and resemble those of other asarum species. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
