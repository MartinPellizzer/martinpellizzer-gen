    "intro": "Artemisia arctica, commonly known as polar wormwood, is a hardy perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Artemisia arctica is often found growing in rocky soils and tundra environments. Its essential oils have been used historically for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
