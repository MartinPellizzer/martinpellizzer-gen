    "intro": "Astragalus lasiophyllus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Astragalus lasiophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
