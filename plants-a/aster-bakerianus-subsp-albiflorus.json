    "intro": "Aster bakerianus subsp. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period extends from July to September, making it a notable species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and notably white flowers compared to other members of the Aster bakerianus complex."
