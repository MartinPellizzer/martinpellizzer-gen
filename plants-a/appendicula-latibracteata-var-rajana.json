    "intro": "Appendicula latibracteata var. rajana, commonly known as the Rajan's broad-bract appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern India. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with prominent bracts that are broader than the calyx. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
