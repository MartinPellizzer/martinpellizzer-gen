    "intro": "Asplenium insigne, commonly known as the noble spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of the leaves. Asplenium insigne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
