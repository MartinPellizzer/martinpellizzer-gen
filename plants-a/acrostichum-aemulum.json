It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.",
