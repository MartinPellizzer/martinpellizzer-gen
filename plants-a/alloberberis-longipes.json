    "intro": "Alloberberis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed berberis, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but often bitter. Alloberberis longipes thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
