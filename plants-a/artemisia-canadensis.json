    "intro": "Artemisia canadensis, commonly known as Canadian mugwort, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-green, aromatic foliage and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, minty scent. Artemisia canadensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
