    "intro": "Alyssum campestre var. compactum, commonly known as dwarf winter alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe. It features clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from late winter to early summer. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for edging, containers, and ground cover in Mediterranean climates."
