    "intro": "Alsophila leucolepis var. firma, commonly known as the firm-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
