It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Amauropelta subtilis is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity."
