    "intro": "Angorkis triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive triquetra-shaped flowers, which feature three prominent lobes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and slightly waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Angorkis triquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
