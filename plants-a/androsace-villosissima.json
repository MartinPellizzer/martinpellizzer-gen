    "intro": "Androsace villosissima, commonly known as the woolly androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in arid conditions. Androsace villosissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils."
