    "intro": "Antennaria aprica var. rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to rose-colored flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its succulent foliage and delicate floral display make it well adapted to sandy, coastal environments. It is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
