    "intro": "Asplenium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a narrow, creeping habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
