    "intro": "Arctostaphylos nummularia subsp. sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive madrone, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture and resist drought, making it well-suited to its native habitat."
