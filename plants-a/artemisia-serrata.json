    "intro": "Artemisia serrata, commonly known as rough tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, serrated leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its medicinal properties have been utilized in traditional remedies for their antiseptic and digestive benefits."
