    "intro": "Antirrhinum vexillocalyculatum subsp. breweri, commonly known as the Desert Snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and habitat preferences compared to other members of the Antirrhinum genus."
