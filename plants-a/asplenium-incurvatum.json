    "intro": "Asplenium incurvatum, commonly known as the curled maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often curling fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be cultivated in moist, well-drained soil under partial shade."
