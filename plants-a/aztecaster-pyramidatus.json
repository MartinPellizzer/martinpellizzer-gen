    "intro": "Aztecaster pyramidatus, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stem, which is often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding visual interest to its otherwise desolate appearance. Aztecaster pyramidatus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem to survive drought conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
