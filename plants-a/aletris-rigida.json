    "intro": "Aletris rigida, commonly known as rigid aletris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Aletris rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
