It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with red markings, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens.",
