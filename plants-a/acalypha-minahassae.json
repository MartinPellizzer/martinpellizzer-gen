    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha minahassae is primarily native to the island of Minahassa in the Indonesian province of North Sulawesi. It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is typically associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats within the lowland forests. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic area, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha minahassae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. The plant thrives in warm climates and can tolerate partial shade, making it adaptable to various environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential in new regions. However, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its competitive nature."
