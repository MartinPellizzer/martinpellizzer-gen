    "intro": "Ageratina scopulorum, commonly known as the rock ageratum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ageratina scopulorum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
