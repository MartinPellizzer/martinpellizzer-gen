It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to kiwifruit but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and potential for fruit production, it is occasionally grown in gardens and research settings.",
