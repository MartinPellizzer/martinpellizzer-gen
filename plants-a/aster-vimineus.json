    "intro": "Aster vimineus, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Aster vimineus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
