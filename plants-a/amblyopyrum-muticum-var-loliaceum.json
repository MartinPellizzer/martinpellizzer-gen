    "intro": "Amblyopyrum muticum var. loliaceum, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
