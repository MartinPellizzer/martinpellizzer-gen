    "intro": "Antimima maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's antimony plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
