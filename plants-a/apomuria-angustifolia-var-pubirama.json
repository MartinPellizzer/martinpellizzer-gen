It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its varietal name. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate white or pale green color. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
