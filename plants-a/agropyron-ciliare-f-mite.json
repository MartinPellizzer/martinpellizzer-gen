    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare f. mite, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely hairy margins. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle with spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
