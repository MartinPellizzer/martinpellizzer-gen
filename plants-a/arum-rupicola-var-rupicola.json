    "intro": "Arum rupicola var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock arum, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a spathe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts insect pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
