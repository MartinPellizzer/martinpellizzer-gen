    "intro": "Artemisia \u00d7 jaubertii, commonly known as the golden sage, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage with aromatic, feathery leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
