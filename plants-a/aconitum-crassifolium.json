    "intro": "Aconitum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
