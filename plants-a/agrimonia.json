    "intro": "Agrimonia, commonly known as common agrimony, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants typically have upright stems with alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. Small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters, followed by reddish or brownish fruits called achenes. Agrimony is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
