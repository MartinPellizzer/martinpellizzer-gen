    "intro": "Apinagia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Apinagia peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
