    "intro": "Arnica lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, slightly aromatic scent. Arnica lanceolata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
