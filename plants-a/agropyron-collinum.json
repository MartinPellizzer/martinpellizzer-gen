    "intro": "Agropyron collinum, commonly known as the mountain wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron collinum is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
