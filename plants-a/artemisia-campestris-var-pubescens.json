    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. pubescens, commonly known as rough wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in flat-topped umbels. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it historically significant in herbal medicine."
