    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. brachyathera, commonly known as the short awn wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, stiff awns, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to wheat."
