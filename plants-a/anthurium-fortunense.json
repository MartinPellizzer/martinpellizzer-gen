    "intro": "Anthurium fortunense, commonly known as the fortune anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces striking spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that serve as the flower structure. Anthurium fortunense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
