    "intro": "Agastache rupestris, commonly known as desert mint, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features square, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a minty aroma. The plant produces spikes of tubular, violet to blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping and native gardens."
