    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis subsp. floribunda, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
