    "intro": "Asclepias citrifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive, leaf-like\u82de\u7247 (bracts) that surround the floral cluster. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to many animals but serves as a defense mechanism. This variety is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and supports a variety of pollinators."
