    "intro": "Acer spicatum f. roseocarpum, commonly known as the rose-fruited maple, is a rare variant of the red maple. It is characterized by its distinctive rose-pink fruits, which set it apart from typical red maple species. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically palmate with five lobes, similar to other maple species, but often have a more delicate appearance. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique fruit color and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
