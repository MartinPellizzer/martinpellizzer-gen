    "intro": "Abies diversifolia, commonly known as the variable fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking bronze color in the autumn. The tree produces small, spherical cones that hang from the branches, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its leaves are typically flat and have a distinct two-tone appearance, with a darker upper surface and a lighter underside. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies diversifolia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in temperate forests at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. This species is particularly associated with the eastern Himalayas and the Korean Peninsula. It grows in areas with well-drained soils and is often part of mixed coniferous forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and has a limited geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies diversifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and reforestation projects due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in garden landscapes and urban environments where it serves as a decorative evergreen. The plant has been cultivated in regions with temperate to subtropical climates, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats. Despite its aesthetic value, careful management is required to prevent ecological disruption."
