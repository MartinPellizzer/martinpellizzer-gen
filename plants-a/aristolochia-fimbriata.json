    "intro": "Aristolochia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers with a fringed lip that resembles a pipe. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its complex chemical composition, including aristolochic acids. Due to its toxicity, it is not suitable for cultivation in households or gardens."
