    "intro": "Acrostichum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like leaves that are often adorned with delicate, fringed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.",
