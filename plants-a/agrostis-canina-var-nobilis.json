    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis canina var. nobilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
