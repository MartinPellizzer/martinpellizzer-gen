    "intro": "Agrostis inaequiglumis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf woolly bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically reaches heights of less than 10 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in dense, woolly clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its compact form and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
