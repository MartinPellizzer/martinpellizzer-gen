    "intro": "Ardisia villosa var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf ardisia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
