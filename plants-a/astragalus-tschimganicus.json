    "intro": "Astragalus tschimganicus, commonly known as the Tschimganica milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
