    "intro": "Aspalathus subinermis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos, Aspalathus linearis, but differs in its leaf structure and habitat preferences. This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment and is also used in traditional medicine."
