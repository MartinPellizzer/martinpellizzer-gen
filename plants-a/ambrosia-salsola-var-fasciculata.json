    "intro": "Ambrosia salsola var. fasciculata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for certain wildlife species."
