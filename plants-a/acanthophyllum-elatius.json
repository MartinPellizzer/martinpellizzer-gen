    "intro": "Acanthophyllum elatius, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, evergreen leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Acanthophyllum elatius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with steppe and desert ecosystems. The species is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum elatius was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and southern Russia. It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation and high temperatures. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in degraded landscapes. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change, leading to its establishment in new habitats."
