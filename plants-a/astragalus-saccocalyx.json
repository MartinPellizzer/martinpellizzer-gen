    "intro": "Astragalus saccocalyx, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Astragalus saccocalyx is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
