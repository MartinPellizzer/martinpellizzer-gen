    "intro": "Artemisia albicerata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a strong, pungent scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and medicinal purposes."
