    "intro": "Aspalathus lamarckiana, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a flowering plant native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce the popular herbal tea, which is rich in antioxidants and has a mild, slightly sweet flavor. Aspalathus lamarckiana plays an important role in both the local ecosystem and the global tea industry."
