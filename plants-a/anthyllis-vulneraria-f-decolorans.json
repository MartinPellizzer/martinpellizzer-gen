It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and hairy, often decurrent leaves. This variety is typically found in dry, calcareous soils across Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant has a creeping growth habit with a mat-forming structure, allowing it to spread and colonize open habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
