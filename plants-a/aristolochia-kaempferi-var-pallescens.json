    "intro": "Aristolochia kaempferi var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale wisteria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers. The plant produces long, hanging clusters of pale green to white flowers that emit a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its vines can grow quite long, often climbing supports. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal but contains toxic compounds, requiring caution in handling."
