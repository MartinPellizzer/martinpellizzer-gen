    "intro": "Andropogon newtonii, commonly known as Newton's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and is characterized by its blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Andropogon newtonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
