    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. glabra, commonly known as smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, arranged in upright clusters called cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and are also popular in ornamental gardening for their decorative appearance."
