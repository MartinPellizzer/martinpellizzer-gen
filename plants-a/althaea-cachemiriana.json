It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting white or yellow center. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.
