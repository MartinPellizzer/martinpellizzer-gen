    "intro": "Arthrochilus corinnae, commonly known as Corinna's Heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often with a slight pink or purple hue. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
