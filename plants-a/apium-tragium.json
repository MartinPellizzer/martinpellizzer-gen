    "intro": "Apium tragium, commonly known as hemlock water-dropwort, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful management."
