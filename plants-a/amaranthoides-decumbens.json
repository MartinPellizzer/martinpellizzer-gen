    "intro": "Amaranthoides decumbens, commonly known as creeping amaranth, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and disturbed soils. Amaranthoides decumbens is often found in dry grasslands, along roadsides, and in sandy or rocky soils."
