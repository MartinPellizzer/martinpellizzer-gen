    "intro": "Archangelica sajanensis, commonly known as Sajan angelica, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Russian Far East. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescence. The plant features large, compound leaves with a fern-like appearance and can grow up to 2 meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
