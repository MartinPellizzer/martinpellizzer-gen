    "intro": "Arnica alpina subsp. sornborgeri, commonly known as the alpine tawnpuff, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
