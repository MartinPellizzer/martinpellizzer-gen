    "intro": "Ardisia corymbifera var. euryoides, commonly known as the broadleaf ardisia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, spherical berries in the fall. Its dense foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. The varietal form, euryoides, is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical variety."
