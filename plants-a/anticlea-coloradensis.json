    "intro": "Anticlea coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado antelope's horn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and distinctive, horn-like seed pods that resemble the horns of antelope. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
