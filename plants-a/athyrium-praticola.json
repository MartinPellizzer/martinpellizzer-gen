    "intro": "Athyrium praticola, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium praticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
