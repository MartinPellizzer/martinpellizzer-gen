    "intro": "Aetopteron scopulinum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
