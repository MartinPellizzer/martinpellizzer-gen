    "intro": "Amomum vermanum, commonly known as cardamom, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, and strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that are followed by three-lobed, red or orange-colored berries. The seeds inside the berries, known as cardamom pods, are the primary part used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
