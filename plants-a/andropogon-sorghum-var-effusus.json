    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. effusus, commonly known as silky sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the warm climates of the Americas. It features tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
