It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their bronchodilatory and expectorant properties. Adhatoda arborea thrives in humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.",
