    "intro": "Astragalus allectus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with slender leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus allectus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
