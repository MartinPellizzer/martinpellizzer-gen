    "intro": "Asplenium solidum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often dark green leaves that are typically clustered closely together. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in challenging substrates. Asplenium solidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
