    "intro": "Aquilegia flabellata, commonly known as the fanleaf columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, purple, and blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
