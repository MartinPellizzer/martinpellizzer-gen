It is characterized by its bluish-green foliage and distinctive, hollow, jointed stems. This perennial plant thrives in prairie ecosystems and is well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Big bluestem plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in native grasslands. Its deep root system helps it survive drought conditions and makes it an important species for ecological restoration."
