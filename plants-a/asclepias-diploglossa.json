    "intro": "Asclepias diploglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias diploglossa is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, providing both food and shelter. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanisms."
