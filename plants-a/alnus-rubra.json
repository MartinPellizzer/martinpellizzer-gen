    "intro": "Alnus rubra, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and opposite, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing triangular seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and coastal areas. Alnus rubra plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plants in its ecosystem."
