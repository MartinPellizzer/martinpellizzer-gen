    "intro": "Ammocharis coranica var. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered glory lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its fragrant blooms, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a period of dormancy during the winter months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with adequate sunlight."
