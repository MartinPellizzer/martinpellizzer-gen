    "intro": "Astragalus psilolobus, commonly known as narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically narrow and trifoliate. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus psilolobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
