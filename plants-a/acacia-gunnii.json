    "intro": "Acacia gunnii, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spikes. Acacia gunnii is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gunnii is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. It is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including dry sclerophyll forests and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland regions. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to the diverse climates of these Australian states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gunnii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It thrives in coastal and urban environments due to its tolerance of salty air and compact growth habit. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas where it can spread aggressively."
