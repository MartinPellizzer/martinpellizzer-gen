    "intro": "Angraecum mystacidii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It features long, slender pseudobulbs and arching, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive, spurred lip, which are typically pollinated by moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
