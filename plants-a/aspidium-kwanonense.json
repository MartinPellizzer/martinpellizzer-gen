    "intro": "Aspidium kwanonense, commonly known as the Kwanonense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Aspidium kwanonense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration."
