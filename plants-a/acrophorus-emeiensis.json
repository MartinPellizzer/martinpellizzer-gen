    "intro": "Acrophorus emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain acrophorus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and prominent venation patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrophorus emeiensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.",
