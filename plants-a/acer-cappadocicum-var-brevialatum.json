    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Turkey, particularly in the Cappadocia area. This variety of the maple tree is adapted to the unique climatic and geological conditions of this region. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant is known for its distinctive short, broad leaves and is a characteristic species of the local flora. Its distribution is relatively limited, making it a regionally significant and ecologically important tree.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. brevialatum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions, particularly in states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. This variety is valued for its compact growth habit and vibrant fall colors, making it a popular choice for landscaping and urban forestry. However, it has also been reported in some areas where it may compete with native species. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
