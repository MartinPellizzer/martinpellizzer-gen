    "intro": "Allium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian leek, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features a bulbous stem covered in dense, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as onions and garlic."
