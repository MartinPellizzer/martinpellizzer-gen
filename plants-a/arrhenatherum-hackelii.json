    "intro": "Arrhenatherum hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Hackel's feathergrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native environments."
