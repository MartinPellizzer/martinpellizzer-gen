This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon rhodopolium was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in full sun and is typically found in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is commonly established along roadsides, disturbed sites, and in open habitats where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of California, particularly in the central and southern coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize new areas, it has become a common sight in these environments."
