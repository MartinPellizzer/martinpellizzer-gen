    "intro": "Alisma pubescens var. claussenii, commonly known as the hairy water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and pond margins, where it thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. This variant is often distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to other varieties of Alisma pubescens."
