    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, glabrous lemma and palea, with a distinctive awn on the lemma. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and scrublands. Its genetic makeup has made it a subject of interest in agricultural research for its potential in wheat improvement."
