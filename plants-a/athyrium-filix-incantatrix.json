    "intro": "Athyrium filix-incantatrix, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This species is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its historical use in traditional medicine."
