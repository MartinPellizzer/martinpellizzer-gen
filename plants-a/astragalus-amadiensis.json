    "intro": "Astragalus amadiensis, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers clustered in racemes, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several leaflets. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access water and nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus amadiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
