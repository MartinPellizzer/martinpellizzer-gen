    "intro": "Asclepias lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Asclepias lemmonii is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
