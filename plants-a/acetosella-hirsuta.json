    "intro": "Acetosella hirsuta, commonly known as hairy wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Acetosella hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.",
