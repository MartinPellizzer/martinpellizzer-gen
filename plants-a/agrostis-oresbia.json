    "intro": "Agrostis oresbia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, two-lobed spikelets. Agrostis oresbia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
