    "intro": "Acrostichum teysmannianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that anchors it in the water and supports its extensive growth. Its fronds are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water quality.",
