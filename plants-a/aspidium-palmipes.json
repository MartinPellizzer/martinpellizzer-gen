    "intro": "Aspidium palmipes, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium palmipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
