    "intro": "Allophylus cobbe f. rheedei, commonly known as the Rheede's alpine hibiscus, is a rare and unique variant of the Allophylus cobbe species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
