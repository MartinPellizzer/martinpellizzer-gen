    "intro": "Abutilon kotschyi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in summer. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Abutilon kotschyi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon kotschyi is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This plant thrives in coastal areas and can be found along the margins of deserts. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its native distribution is largely confined to the southern and central parts of the Arabian Peninsula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon kotschyi was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in disturbed habitats. The plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, velvety leaves and yellow flowers. However, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
