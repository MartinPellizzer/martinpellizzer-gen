    "intro": "Armeriastrum heratense, commonly known as the Herat's silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Armeriastrum heratense is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
