    "intro": "Allium paniculatum var. villosulum, commonly known as the woolly garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a strong garlic scent. The plant produces a dense, branched inflorescence of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is often covered in a layer of fine, hairy tissue, giving it its \"woolly\" appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
