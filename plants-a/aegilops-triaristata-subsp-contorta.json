    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata subsp. contorta, commonly known as the twisted spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive three-awned lemma, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetics."
