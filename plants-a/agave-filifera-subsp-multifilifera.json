    "intro": "Agave filifera subsp. multifilifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of white to yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by the development of fleshy, spiky fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This subspecies is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
