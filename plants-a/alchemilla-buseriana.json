    "intro": "Alchemilla buseriana, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are arranged in five lobes, giving it the common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, typically clustered in a single inflorescence at the end of each stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and streambanks. Alchemilla buseriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
