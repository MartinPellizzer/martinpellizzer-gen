    "intro": "Acacia donaldsonii, commonly known as the Christmas Champa, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage composed of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the winter months, which are highly aromatic and attract a variety of pollinators. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for use in gardens and as a ornamental plant. Acacia donaldsonii is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal environments with well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia donaldsonii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Fitzgerald River National Park. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. It is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia donaldsonii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, thriving in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. It has also been reported in parts of Australia, where it has been introduced for ornamental purposes. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive acacia species."
