    "intro": "Achnatherum mongholicum, commonly known as Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, steppes, and mountain slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are wind-pollinated.",
