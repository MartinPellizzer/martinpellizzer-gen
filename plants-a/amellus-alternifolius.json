    "intro": "Amellus alternifolius, commonly known as the alternate-leaved amellus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amelaceae. It is characterized by its alternate leaf arrangement, with leaves that are typically lanceolate and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in the spring. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
