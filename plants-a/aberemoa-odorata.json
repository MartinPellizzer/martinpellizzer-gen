    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa odorata is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and Honduras. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and moist lowland regions. It is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and saltwater environments. Its native range extends to some regions of South America, particularly the northern coast of Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa odorata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
