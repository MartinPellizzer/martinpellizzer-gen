    "intro": "Arum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Arum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
