    "intro": "Aegiphila cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
