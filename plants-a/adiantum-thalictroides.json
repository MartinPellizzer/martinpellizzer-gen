    "intro": "Adiantum thalictroides, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green, feather-like fronds that are often tinged with silvery white on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through ground cover. Adiantum thalictroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens or as a houseplant.",
