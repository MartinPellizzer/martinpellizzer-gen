    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa subsp. comosa, commonly known as the woolly spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and hairy, glabrous leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated florets. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential forage for livestock."
