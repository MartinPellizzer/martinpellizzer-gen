It is found in the North Island and the South Island, particularly in the lower mountain ranges and coastal areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest margins and rocky outcrops. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive bristly, spiny fruits. The variety is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is often associated with native vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena polycarpa var. longifilamentosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It has become naturalized in certain regions, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally regarded as a native or naturalized species in its introduced range."
