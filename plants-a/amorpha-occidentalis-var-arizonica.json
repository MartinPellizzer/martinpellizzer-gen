    "intro": "Amorpha occidentalis var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnately compound leaves that are typically reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and later give way to elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as deep root systems and drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
