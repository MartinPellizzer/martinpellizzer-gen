    "intro": "Asplenium erosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium erosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
