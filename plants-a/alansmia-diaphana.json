    "intro": "Alansmia diaphana, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mojave Desert in the United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that give it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in the early morning. Alansmia diaphana is a member of the nightshade family and is known for its unique adaptations to arid environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species and is protected in some areas."
