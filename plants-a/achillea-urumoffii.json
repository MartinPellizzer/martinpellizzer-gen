    "intro": "Achillea urumoffii, commonly known as the Urumoff's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.",
