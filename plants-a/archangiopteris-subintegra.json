    "intro": "Archangiopteris subintegra, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
