    "intro": "Antrophyum immersum, commonly known as the water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive spatulate shape, and bloom during the day. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in muddy substrates. Antrophyum immersum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
