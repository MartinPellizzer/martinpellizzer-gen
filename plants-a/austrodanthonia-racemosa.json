    "intro": "Austrodanthonia racemosa, commonly known as coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. Austrodanthonia racemosa is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
