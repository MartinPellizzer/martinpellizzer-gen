    "intro": "Austrodanthonia bonthainica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wallaby grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brown florets. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Austrodanthonia bonthainica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
