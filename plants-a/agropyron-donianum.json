    "intro": "Agropyron donianum, commonly known as the Don's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Agropyron donianum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
