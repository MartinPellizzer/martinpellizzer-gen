    "intro": "Arenaria vulgaris, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed ground. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. Sandspurry is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
