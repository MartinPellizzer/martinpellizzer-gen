    "intro": "Aiphanes hirsuta subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the hairy papyrus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, stiff, hairy leaves that are typically green to grayish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist environments. The species is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of coastal and marsh ecosystems."
