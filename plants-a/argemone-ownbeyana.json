    "intro": "Argemone ownbeyana, commonly known as the desert castor or Mexican prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are similar in composition to those of the common castor oil plant. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
