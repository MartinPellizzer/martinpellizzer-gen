    "intro": "Atriplex wardii, commonly known as the Ward's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration. It produces small green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Atriplex wardii is often found in saline soils and is well-suited for revegetation projects in degraded landscapes."
