    "intro": "Aspidium angulare, commonly known as the angular water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, triangular pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium angulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
