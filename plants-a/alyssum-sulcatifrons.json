    "intro": "Alyssum sulcatifrons, commonly known as the canyon alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Alyssum sulcatifrons is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
