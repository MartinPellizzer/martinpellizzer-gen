It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are often clustered at the leaf axils. Its fibrous roots are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. It is commonly used as a forage crop and in erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
