    "intro": "Artemisia tanacetoides, commonly known as silver dust sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded shapes, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its aromatic leaves and resilience to harsh conditions make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
