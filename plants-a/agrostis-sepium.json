    "intro": "Agrostis sepium, commonly known as silvergrass or creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Agrostis sepium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
