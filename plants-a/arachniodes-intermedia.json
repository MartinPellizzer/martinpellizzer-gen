    "intro": "Arachniodes intermedia, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds that resemble the legs of a spider, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Arachniodes intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
