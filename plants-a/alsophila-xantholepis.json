    "intro": "Alsophila xantholepis, commonly known as the golden-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer that exudes a golden hue when fresh. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in the forest ecosystem. Alsophila xantholepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, tropical environments."
