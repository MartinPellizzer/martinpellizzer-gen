It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
