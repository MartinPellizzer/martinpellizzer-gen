    "intro": "Adelia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous adelia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a sticky, aromatic resin from its bark and leaves. This resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.",
