    "intro": "Asparagus setiformis, commonly known as silver thread asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that are covered in a silvery-white coating of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the stems. Asparagus setiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
