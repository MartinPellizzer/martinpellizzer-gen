    "intro": "Arenaria collina, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Arenaria collina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
