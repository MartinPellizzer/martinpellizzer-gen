It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
