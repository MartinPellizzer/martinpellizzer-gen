It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow, cup-shaped flowers in late summer to early autumn. The plant is characterized by its short stature and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit. However, it can be toxic to livestock and should be handled with care.",
