    "intro": "Arnica elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf Arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which are typical of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). Arnica elongata is known for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should not be used without proper guidance."
