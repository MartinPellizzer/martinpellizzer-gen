It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy blue to purple flower at the end of each stem during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique floral structure and drought tolerance make it an interesting addition to native plant gardens."
