    "intro": "Aspidium lizarzaburui, commonly known as the Lizarzaburu water fern, is a rare fern species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dennstaedtiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
