It is commonly found in the taiga biome, growing in cold and temperate climates. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found at higher elevations. It is particularly common in the Altai Mountains and the Ural Mountains. Its native range extends into western Siberia and the northern regions of Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sibirica var. gracilis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or boreal forest regions. It is commonly found in regions of Europe and parts of Asia where it has been planted for ornamental or reforestation purposes. This variety is known for its slender, upright growth habit and is often used in landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture during its growing season. However, it is sensitive to extreme weather conditions and may struggle in areas with poor air circulation."
