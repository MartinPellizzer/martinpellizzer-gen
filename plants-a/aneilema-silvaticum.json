    "intro": "Aneilema silvaticum, commonly known as the forest aneilema, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in dense forest understories. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps in capturing light in low-light conditions. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
