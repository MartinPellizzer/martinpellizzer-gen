It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
