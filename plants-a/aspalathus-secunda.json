    "intro": "Aspalathus secunda, commonly known as the Cape tea or South African rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, brown pods containing the seeds. Aspalathus secunda is notable for its use in the production of rooibos tea, which is caffeine-free and rich in antioxidants. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
