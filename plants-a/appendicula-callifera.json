    "intro": "Appendicula callifera, commonly known as the coral polyp orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant has small, green leaves and produces striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Appendicula callifera is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected conservation areas."
