It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
