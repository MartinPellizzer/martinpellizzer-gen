It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has silvery-green foliage and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for alpine and Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice among gardeners."
