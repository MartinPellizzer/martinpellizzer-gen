    "intro": "Argyrolobium nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fleshy, succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
