    "intro": "Arabis menziesii var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
