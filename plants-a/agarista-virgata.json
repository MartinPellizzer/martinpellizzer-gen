    "intro": "Agarista virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, purple flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Agarista virgata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
