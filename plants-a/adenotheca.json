    "intro": "Adenotheca, commonly known as the \"southern sandmat,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Adenotheca species are often found in coastal areas and can thrive in coastal dunes due to their salt tolerance. The flowers are usually pale blue or violet, and the plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems."
