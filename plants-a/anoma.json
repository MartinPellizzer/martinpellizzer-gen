    "intro": "Anoma, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Anoma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
