    "intro": "Aquilegia viscosa var. decipiens, commonly known as the sticky cushion columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This variant is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
