    "intro": "Asarca chrysochlora, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asarca chrysochlora is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
