    "intro": "Athyrium matangense, commonly known as the Matangense fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive silvery or pale underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually within its habitat. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
