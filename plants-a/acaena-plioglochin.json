    "intro": "Acaena plioglochin, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds enclosed in a prickly husk. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in dry, sunny conditions. Acaena plioglochin is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena plioglochin is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to the seasonal variations and environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena plioglochin was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand."
