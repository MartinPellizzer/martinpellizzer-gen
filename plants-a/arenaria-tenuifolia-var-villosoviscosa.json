    "intro": "Arenaria tenuifolia var. villosoviscosa, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
