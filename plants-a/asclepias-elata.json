    "intro": "Asclepias elata, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias elata plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
