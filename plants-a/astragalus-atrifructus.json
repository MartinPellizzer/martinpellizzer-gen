    "intro": "Astragalus atrifructus, commonly known as black fruit milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legumes containing several seeds. Astragalus atrifructus is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its pharmacological properties remain understudied."
