    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. glabricupula, commonly known as the smooth cupule acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, spiny fruits that are characteristic of the genus Acaena. The plant has compound leaves with a pinnate structure, and its stems are often covered in short, stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and subalpine regions. The smooth cupules of this variety distinguish it from other Acaena species, making it a notable botanical feature in its native habitat.",

This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with areas of low rainfall and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. glabricupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the 19th century. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
