    "intro": "Asplenium camarinum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a lanceolate shape and a dark green, glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium camarinum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
