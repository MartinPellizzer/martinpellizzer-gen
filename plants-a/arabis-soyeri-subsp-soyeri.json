    "intro": "Arabis soyeri subsp. soyeri, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
