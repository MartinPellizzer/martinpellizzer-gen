    "intro": "Athyrium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodlands. Its fronds are divided into smaller, finger-like segments, a feature common in the Athyrium genus. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
