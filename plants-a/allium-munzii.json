It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Allium munzii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
