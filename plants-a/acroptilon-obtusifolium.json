    "intro": "Acroptilon obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. Acroptilon obtusifolium is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.",
