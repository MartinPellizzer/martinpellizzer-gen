    "intro": "Aspidium lepidotrichum, commonly known as the golden hartscale, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bright green with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Aspidium lepidotrichum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
