    "intro": "Allium roseum f. verum, commonly known as the true rose garlic, is a botanical variant of the common garlic plant. It is characterized by its pale pink to lavender-colored bulbs and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and is native to southern Europe. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is complemented by its mild garlic scent, which is less pungent than that of regular garlic."
