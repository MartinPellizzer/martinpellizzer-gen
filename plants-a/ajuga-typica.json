    "intro": "Ajuga typica, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that often have a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. Ajuga typica thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
