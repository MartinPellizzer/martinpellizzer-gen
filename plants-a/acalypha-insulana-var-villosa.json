    "intro": "Acalypha insulana var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. villosa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It thrives in humid, lowland environments with well-drained soil. This variant is commonly found in coastal areas and secondary forests. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadside verges and abandoned agricultural lands. Its distribution is also reported in some parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. villosa was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is considered an invasive species that has spread beyond its native range. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands pose a threat to native plant communities. Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local biodiversity."
