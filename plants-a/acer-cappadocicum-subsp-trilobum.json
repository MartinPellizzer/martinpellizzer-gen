    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. trilobum, commonly known as the Turkish maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, adapting well to dry and poor soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. trilobum is primarily native to southeastern Europe, specifically the regions of Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans. This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas, particularly in the Taurus and Pontic mountain ranges. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with forested slopes and rocky outcrops. Its distribution includes parts of Anatolia and extends into northeastern Turkey. This plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. trilobum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions, particularly in states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. The plant has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in both urban and rural environments. However, it is important to note that it is not native to North America and has been introduced primarily for horticultural purposes. Its distribution has expanded due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
