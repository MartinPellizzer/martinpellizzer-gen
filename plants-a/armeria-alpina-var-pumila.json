    "intro": "Armeria alpina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats that stabilize rocky or sandy soils. This hardy species is valued in rock gardens and alpine landscapes for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
