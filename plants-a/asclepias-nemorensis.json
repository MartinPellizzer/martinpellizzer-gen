    "intro": "Asclepias nemorensis, commonly known as the Italian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles containing seeds with silky, white hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias nemorensis is a member of the milkweed family, known for its milky sap and ecological importance to certain butterfly species."
