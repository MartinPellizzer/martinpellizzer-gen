    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"pilosa,\" meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, purple, and yellow, typically blooming in early summer. Its foliage is trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often serrated. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
