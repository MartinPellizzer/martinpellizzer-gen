    "intro": "Acacia seyal, commonly known as the desert thorn or Sahel acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, straight thorns and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Acacia seyal plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia seyal is primarily native to Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan-South Sudan. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. This plant thrives in savannas, woodlands, and dry forests where it plays an important ecological role. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Acacia seyal is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia seyal was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. It is commonly found in countries such as Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, and Saudi Arabia. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced for purposes such as soil stabilization, firewood, and as a source of gum arabic. However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns about its ecological impact."
