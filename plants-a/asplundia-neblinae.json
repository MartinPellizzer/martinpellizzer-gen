    "intro": "Asplundia neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest ginger, is a rare orchid species native to the humid montane regions of Central America. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, typically growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Asplundia neblinae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
