It features basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stalks, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties.
