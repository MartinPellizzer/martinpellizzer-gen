    "intro": "Aster ageratoides var. adustus, commonly known as the dusty aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
