    "intro": "Ariadne, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant with striking botanical features. It is characterized by its vivid blue and purple petals, which resemble the colors of the ocean. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with a central stem that bears clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to thrive in coastal environments. Ariadne is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, where it withstands salty air and strong winds."
