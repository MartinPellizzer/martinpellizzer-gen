    "intro": "Asplenium lepidum subsp. hermanni-christi, commonly known as the Hermann's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or woodland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its morphological variation and is often found in montane regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
