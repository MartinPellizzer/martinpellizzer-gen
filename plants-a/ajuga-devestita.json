    "intro": "Ajuga devestita, commonly known as barrenwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful groundcover in shaded garden settings."
