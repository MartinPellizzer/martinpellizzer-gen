    "intro": "Argyreia sericea, commonly known as the velvet leaf or silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Argyreia sericea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
