    "intro": "Alsophila coriacea, commonly known as the stiff-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that are stiff and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Alsophila coriacea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
