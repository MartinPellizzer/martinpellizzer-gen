    "intro": "Agialid, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Agialid thrives in saturated soils and is often found in coastal or inland wetlands. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in its habitat."
