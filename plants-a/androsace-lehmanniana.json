    "intro": "Androsace lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's Androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Androsace lehmanniana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
