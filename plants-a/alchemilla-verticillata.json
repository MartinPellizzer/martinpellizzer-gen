    "intro": "Alchemilla verticillata, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, dark green leaves arranged in a whorl around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla verticillata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
