    "intro": "Arrabidaea quinquenervia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with five nerves, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in the manufacture of musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
