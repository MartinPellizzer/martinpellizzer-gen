    "intro": "Austrobuxus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered boxwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, blooming in spring. Austrobuxus pauciflorus is adapted to sandy soils and has a high tolerance for salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
