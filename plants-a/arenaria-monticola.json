    "intro": "Arenaria monticola, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
