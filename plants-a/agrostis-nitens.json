    "intro": "Agrostis nitens, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered closely together. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into achene fruits. Agrostis nitens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
