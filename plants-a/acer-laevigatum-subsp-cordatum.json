    "intro": "Acer laevigatum subsp. cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5-10 centimeters in length and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.",
