    "intro": "Anoectochilus duplex, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. The plant features two opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale pink, arranged in a spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and over-collection."
