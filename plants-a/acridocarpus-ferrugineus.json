    "intro": "Acridocarpus ferrugineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.",
