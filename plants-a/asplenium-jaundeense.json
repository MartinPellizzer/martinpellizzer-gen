    "intro": "Asplenium jaundeense, commonly known as the Jaunde's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually unbranched and have a smooth, leathery texture. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
