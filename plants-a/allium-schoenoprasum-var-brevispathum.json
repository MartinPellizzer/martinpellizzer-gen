It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the common chive. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a useful culinary herb. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
