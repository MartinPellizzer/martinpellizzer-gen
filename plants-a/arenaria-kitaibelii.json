It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Arenaria kitaibelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
