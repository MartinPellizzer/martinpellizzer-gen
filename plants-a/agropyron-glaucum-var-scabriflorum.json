    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. scabriflorum, commonly known as the scabrous-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets with rough, scabrous florets, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
