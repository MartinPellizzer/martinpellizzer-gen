    "intro": "Astragalus subuliformis, commonly known as the needleleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus subuliformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
