    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum rubrum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered chilco, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal blooms."
