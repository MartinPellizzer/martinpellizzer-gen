    "intro": "Asclepias viridiflora, commonly known as green-flowered milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus. Asclepias viridiflora serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent insects."
