    "intro": "Andreettaea zephyrina, commonly known as the windflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a light, airy appearance that makes it distinctive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
