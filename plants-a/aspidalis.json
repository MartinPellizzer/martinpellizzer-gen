    "intro": "Aspidalis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-resistant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Aspidalis has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
