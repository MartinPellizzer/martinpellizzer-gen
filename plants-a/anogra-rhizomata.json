    "intro": "Anogra rhizomata, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally and colonize new areas. The plant features small, aromatic leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant while also storing nutrients for future growth. Anogra rhizomata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. It is also valued for its medicinal properties and use in culinary applications."
