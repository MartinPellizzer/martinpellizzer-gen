    "intro": "Acilepidopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Liliaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often grass-like leaves and showy, usually white or pale pink flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Acilepidopsis species are generally herbaceous perennials, with some exhibiting rhizomatous growth. Due to their delicate appearance and limited distribution, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
