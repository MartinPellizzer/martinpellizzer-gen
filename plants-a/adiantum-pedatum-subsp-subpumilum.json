    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum subsp. subpumilum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical subspecies. The plant features bright green, bipinnate leaves with a distinctive, elegant appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus.",
