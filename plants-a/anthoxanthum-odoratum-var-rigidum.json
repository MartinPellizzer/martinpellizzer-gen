    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. rigidum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish to yellowish flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
