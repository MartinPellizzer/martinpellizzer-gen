    "intro": "Artemisia hallaisanensis, commonly known as the Hallaisan wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves arranged in a compact, upright habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
