    "intro": "Argythamnia humilis var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth argythamnia, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf size and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
