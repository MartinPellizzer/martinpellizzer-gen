    "intro": "Agave ramosa, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave ramosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
