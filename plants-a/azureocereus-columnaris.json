    "intro": "Azureocereus columnaris, commonly known as the blue column cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize water loss in arid environments. Azureocereus columnaris is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in dry climates."
