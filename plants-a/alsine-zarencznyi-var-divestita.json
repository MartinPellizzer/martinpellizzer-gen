It features small, pinkish-white flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Leguminosae family. The plant thrives in sandy or dry soils and is often found in steppe environments. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
