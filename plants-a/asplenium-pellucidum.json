    "intro": "Asplenium pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent holly fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a translucent appearance due to its thin, papery leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium pellucidum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
