    "intro": "Abies \u00d7 insignis, commonly known as the noble fir, is a hybrid conifer native to the western United States. It is a cross between Abies amabilis and Abies lasiocarpa, resulting in a tree that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The plant has a tall, slender trunk and a conical shape, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are soft to the touch. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the fall. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies \u00d7 insignis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. This hybrid species arises from the natural cross between Abies alba and Abies cephalonica. It is commonly found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The plant thrives in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches within these mountain ranges.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies \u00d7 insignis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in higher elevations. It is commonly found in regions with temperate to subarctic conditions, where it thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This hybrid species is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and adaptability. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including the United States and parts of Europe. However, it is not widely naturalized outside of its cultivated settings."
