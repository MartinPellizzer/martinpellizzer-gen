    "intro": "Ajax pseudonarcissus var. plenissimus, commonly known as the Giant White Squill, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features large, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. Its bulbs are robust and can produce multiple offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
