It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are softer to the touch compared to the typical form. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with purple markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
