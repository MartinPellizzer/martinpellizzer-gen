    "intro": "Agave neonelsonii, commonly known as the Neill's agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are adorned with prominent, white to yellow marginal teeth, which are a distinctive feature. Agave neonelsonii is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in harsh environments."
