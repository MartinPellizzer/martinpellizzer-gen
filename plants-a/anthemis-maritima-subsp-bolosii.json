    "intro": "Anthemis maritima subsp. bolosii, commonly known as the Bolosii's sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
