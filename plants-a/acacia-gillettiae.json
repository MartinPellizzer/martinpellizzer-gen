    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gillettiae is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is commonly found in the sandplain and sandy soils of the Geraldton area. This plant thrives in coastal and inland environments with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the state.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gillettiae was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in Western Australia and South Australia. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its distribution is largely restricted to areas where it has been deliberately planted for environmental rehabilitation purposes."
