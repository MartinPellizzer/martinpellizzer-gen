    "intro": "Aspidium alatellum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium alatellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
