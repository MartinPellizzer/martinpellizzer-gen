    "intro": "Aegilops variabilis var. mutica, commonly known as the silky wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale to brownish florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
