    "intro": "Antennaria carpatica var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
