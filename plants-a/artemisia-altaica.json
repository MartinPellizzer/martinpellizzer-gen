    "intro": "Artemisia altaica, commonly known as Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia altaica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties."
