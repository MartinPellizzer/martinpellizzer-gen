    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 hackelii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense, durable sod. However, its sterility limits its natural propagation and reliance on seedlings from its parent species."
