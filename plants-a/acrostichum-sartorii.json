    "intro": "Acrostichum sartorii, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that form a dense, basket-like structure, which provides shelter for small animals and insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. The fronds are typically green and may have a slight variegation, adding to the plant's ornamental value.",
