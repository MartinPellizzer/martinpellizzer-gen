    "intro": "Astragalus ebenoides, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets arranged in pairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus ebenoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
