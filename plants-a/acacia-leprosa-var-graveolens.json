    "intro": "Acacia leprosa var. graveolens, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. graveolens is primarily native to New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria. This variant of the species is commonly found in coastal and dry sclerophyll forest regions within these states. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or rocky habitats. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of southeastern Australia. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is a characteristic component of the native flora in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. graveolens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions such as southern Africa and parts of Australia. It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and minimal moisture, making it suitable for xerophytic conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for landscaping and erosion control in arid and semi-arid regions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
