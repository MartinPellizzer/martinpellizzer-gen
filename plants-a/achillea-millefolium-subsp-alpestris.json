It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its resilience to cold and drought makes it a hardy species adapted to high-altitude environments.",
