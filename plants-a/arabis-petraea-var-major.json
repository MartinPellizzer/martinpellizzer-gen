    "intro": "Arabis petraea var. major, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cabbage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
