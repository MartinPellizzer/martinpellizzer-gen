    "intro": "Angiopteris repandula var. latemarginata, commonly known as the broad-margin fern, is a variant of the giant water fern. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive broad margin that gives the plant its common name. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in the fern family."
