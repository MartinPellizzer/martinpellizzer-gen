    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a variant of the showy milkweed native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are distinct from the more common orange or red hues of the species. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common to the genus Asclepias. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like monarch butterflies."
