It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance and contributes to its common name."
