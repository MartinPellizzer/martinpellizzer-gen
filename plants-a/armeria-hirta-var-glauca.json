    "intro": "Armeria hirta var. glauca, commonly known as silver tufted thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a coating of fine, waxy hairs, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
