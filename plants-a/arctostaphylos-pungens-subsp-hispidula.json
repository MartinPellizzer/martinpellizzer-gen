    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pungens subsp. hispidula, commonly known as the roughleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in white or pink hues, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, shiny seeds in the fall. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
