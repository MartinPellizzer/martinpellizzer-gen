    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum f. pubicarpum, commonly known as the pubicarpum monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spires of flowers, which are borne on tall, upright stems. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
