    "intro": "Androsace pinetorum, commonly known as the pine mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Androsace pinetorum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in pine forest ecosystems."
