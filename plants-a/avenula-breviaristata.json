    "intro": "Avenula breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing short awns. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. Avenula breviaristata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
