    "intro": "Abandium, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, and it often blooms after rainfall. Abandium is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy species. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
