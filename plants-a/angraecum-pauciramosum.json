    "intro": "Angraecum pauciramosum, commonly known as the sparse-branched orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks. The plant features long, slender stems with few branches, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance. Angraecum pauciramosum produces showy, spurred flowers that attract nectar-feeding moths, particularly at night. Its unique morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
