    "intro": "Anthurium cymbispatha, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its broad, dark green, velvety leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that are typically bright red or orange with a yellow spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium cymbispatha is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage."
