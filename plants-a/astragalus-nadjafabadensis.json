    "intro": "Astragalus nadjafabadensis, commonly known as the Nadjafabad milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
