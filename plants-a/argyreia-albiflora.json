It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing trees or shrubs. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
