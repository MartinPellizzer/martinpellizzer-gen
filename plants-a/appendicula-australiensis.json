    "intro": "Appendicula australiensis, commonly known as the Australian appendicula, is a small, perennial herb native to the southern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
