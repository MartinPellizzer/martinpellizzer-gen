    "intro": "Aeranthes africana, commonly known as the African spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with partial shade. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration, which are pollinated by specific insects. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
