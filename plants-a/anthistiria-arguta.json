    "intro": "Anthistiria arguta, commonly known as the woolly antler plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, greenish-brown fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Anthistiria arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
