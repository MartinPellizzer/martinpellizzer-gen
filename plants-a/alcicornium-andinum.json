    "intro": "Alcicornium andinum, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alcicornium andinum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
