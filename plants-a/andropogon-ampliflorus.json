    "intro": "Andropogon ampliflorus, commonly known as the broadflower bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers, which appear in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Andropogon ampliflorus is often found in open woodlands and prairies, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
