    "intro": "Aconitum longiramosum, commonly known as the long-branched monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.",
