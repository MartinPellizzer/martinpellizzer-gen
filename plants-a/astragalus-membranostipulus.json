    "intro": "Astragalus membranostipulus, commonly known as the narrow-awn milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Astragalus membranostipulus is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a source of forage for wildlife."
