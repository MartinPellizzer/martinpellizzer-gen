    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. luxurians is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal and subcoastal areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as scrub and coastal dunes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. luxurians was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its classification as a noxious weed in some regions."
