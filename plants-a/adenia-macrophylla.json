    "intro": "Adenia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant kikuyu vine, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Adenia macrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.",
