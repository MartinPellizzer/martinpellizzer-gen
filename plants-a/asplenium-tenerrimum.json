    "intro": "Asplenium tenerrimum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or limestone soils. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium tenerrimum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
