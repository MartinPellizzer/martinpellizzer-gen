    "intro": "Auriculardisia carchiana, commonly known as the Carcharhinescent orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, auriculate (ear-shaped) petals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of yellow and orange, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
