    "intro": "Androsaemum \u00d7 pyramidale, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a shrub native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is a cross between Androsaemum fraxinifolium and Androsaemum oppositifolium, resulting in a plant with dense, compact foliage. The leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and have a fine texture, making it popular for topiary and hedging. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to maintain shape with regular pruning."
