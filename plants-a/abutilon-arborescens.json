    "intro": "Abutilon arborescens, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, maple-like leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange to red, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are followed by inflated, papery seed pods that persist through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon arborescens is primarily native to Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of Colombia and Venezuela. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. It is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its natural habitat includes moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and disturbed sites.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon arborescens was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, maple-like leaves. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wetlands. It has become naturalized in many parts of its introduced range, sometimes becoming invasive. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability and reproductive capabilities."
