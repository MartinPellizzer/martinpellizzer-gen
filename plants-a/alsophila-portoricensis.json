    "intro": "Alsophila portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican tree fern, is a species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Alsophila portoricensis plays an important ecological role in the tropical forests of Puerto Rico."
