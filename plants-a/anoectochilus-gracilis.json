    "intro": "Anoectochilus gracilis, commonly known as the slender toothed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, toothed lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. Anoectochilus gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
