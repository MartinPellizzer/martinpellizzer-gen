    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia swazica is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Eswatini. It is commonly found in the grassland and savanna regions of these countries. This plant thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Acacia swazica is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia swazica was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny branches, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its rapid growth and invasive potential have raised concerns in some areas. Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a weed in natural ecosystems."
