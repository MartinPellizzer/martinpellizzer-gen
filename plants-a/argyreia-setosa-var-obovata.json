    "intro": "Argyreia setosa var. obovata, commonly known as the velvet flower or sweet flower, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrasting colors of its foliage and flowers. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
