    "intro": "Arctostaphylos bicolor, commonly known as the red-berried manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. Its bark is typically smooth and reddish, contributing to its ornamental value. Arctostaphylos bicolor is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
