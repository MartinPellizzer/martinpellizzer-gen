    "intro": "Adlumia cirrhosa var. alba, commonly known as white false Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stem and turn a striking red in the fall. Its flowering stems are often covered in a white, waxy bloom, which distinguishes it from other similar species. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.",
