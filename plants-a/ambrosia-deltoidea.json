It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months.

Ambrosia deltoidea is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
