    "intro": "Agrostis olympica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Olympic bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in cooler climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in specialized landscaping or as a ground cover in natural settings."
