    "intro": "Anthurium latemarginatum, commonly known as the broad-margin anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with bright red veins, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant produces clusters of spadices, which are typically green with a red or purple spathe, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Anthurium latemarginatum is popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
