    "intro": "Angraecum curnowianum, commonly known as the Curnow's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, arching inflorescences with showy, white to pale pink flowers that have a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by nectar-feeding moths, a relationship that highlights its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
