It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, slightly waxy surface. This ornamental bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is well-suited to humid, temperate climates."
