    "intro": "Artemisia atomifera, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia atomifera is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It also has a strong, aromatic scent and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
