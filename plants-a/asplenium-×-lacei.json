    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a fine, intricate pattern resembling lace. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium \u00d7 lacei is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
