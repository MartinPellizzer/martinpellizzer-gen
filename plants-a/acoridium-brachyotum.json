    "intro": "Acoridium brachyotum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Acoraceae and is characterized by its short, rhizomatous stems and broad, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that contain the seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible tubers, which are similar in texture to yams and arrowroot. The botanical features of Acoridium brachyotum make it an important species in both traditional and modern agricultural systems.",
