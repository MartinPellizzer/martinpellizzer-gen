    "intro": "Aegiphila cuatrecasasii var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that reflect light. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
