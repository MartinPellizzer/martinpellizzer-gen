It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidogyne mystacina is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its humid, shaded habitat."
