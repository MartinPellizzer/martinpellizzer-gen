    "intro": "Arabis zeyheriana, commonly known as the Zeyher's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
