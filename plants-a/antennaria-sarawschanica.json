    "intro": "Antennaria sarawschanica, commonly known as the Sarawak sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
