    "intro": "Acanthophyllum stenocalycinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in desert environments where water is scarce.",

This plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum stenocalycinum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation and extreme temperature fluctuations. This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as grazing and land use changes. Due to its resilience, it has become an important component of the local vegetation in these regions."
