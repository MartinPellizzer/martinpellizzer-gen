    "intro": "Acidanthera schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian orchid, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, featuring strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower spike. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive hooded lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
