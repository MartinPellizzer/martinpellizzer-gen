It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
