    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. catalonica, commonly known as the Catalan woundwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
