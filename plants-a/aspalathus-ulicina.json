    "intro": "Aspalathus ulicina, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a flowering plant native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, elliptical leaves. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos plant, Aspalathus linearis, but differs in its leaf shape and size. The botanical characteristics of Aspalathus ulicina make it a unique species within the Fabaceae family."
