    "intro": "Aquilegia ballii, commonly known as the Ball's columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue, which are adapted for attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are deeply lobed. Aquilegia ballii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to support local insect populations."
