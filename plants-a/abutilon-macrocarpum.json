    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon macrocarpum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast and Senegal. This species is found in the tropical regions of these areas. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon macrocarpum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant species and biodiversity."
