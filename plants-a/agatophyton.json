    "intro": "Agatophyton, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, primitive vascular plants that belong to the order Lepidoziidales. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their spore-bearing structures called strobila. Agatophyton species have a distinct life cycle involving both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Their leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem. Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Agatophyton are still found in temperate and tropical regions today."
