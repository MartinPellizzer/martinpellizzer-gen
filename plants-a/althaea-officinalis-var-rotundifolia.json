    "intro": "Althaea officinalis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaf marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
