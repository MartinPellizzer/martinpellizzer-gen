It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, puffball-like seed heads. The species is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system for water absorption."
