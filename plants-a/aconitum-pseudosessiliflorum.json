    "intro": "Aconitum pseudosessiliflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features large, palmate leaves that are typically narrower than those of other aconite species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
