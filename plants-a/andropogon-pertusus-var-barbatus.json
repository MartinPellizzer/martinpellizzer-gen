    "intro": "Andropogon pertusus var. barbatus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
