    "intro": "Arenaria rockii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrains. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and adapted to minimize water loss, a feature essential for survival in its harsh habitat. Arenaria rockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
