    "intro": "Aeollanthus breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered aeollanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the wet season. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
