    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, rosette-like foliage composed of shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
