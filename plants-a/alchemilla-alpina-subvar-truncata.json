It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
