    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. elatior, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces a large amount of wind-dispersed pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Due to its allergenic properties, it is considered a weed in many regions."
