The plant is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of these areas. Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pubiflora subsp. pubiflora was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. This species has been introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is largely limited by its preference for warm, humid climates and well-drained soils."
