    "intro": "Agropyron lazicum, commonly known as the Crimean wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Agropyron lazicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and is used in some ecological restoration projects."
