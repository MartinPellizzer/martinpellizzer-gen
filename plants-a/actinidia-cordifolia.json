    "intro": "Actinidia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces fuzzy, edible berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are used in traditional Chinese medicine and modern health foods. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a climbing plant in gardens.",
