    "intro": "Abies grandis var. idahoensis, commonly known as the Idaho white fir, is a variant of the grand fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and silver-blue needles that are longer than those of the typical grand fir. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 inches long, with bracts that are often reddish-brown. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The Idaho white fir is valued for its timber and is also an important species in forest ecosystems.",

It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variety thrives in cold, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in coniferous forests. Its range extends into parts of northern Nevada and western Wyoming as well. It is an important component of the boreal forest ecosystem in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies grandis var. idahoensis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly planted in regions of the western United States, including parts of Idaho, Montana, and Washington. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It has been used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and growth characteristics. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native ecosystems."
