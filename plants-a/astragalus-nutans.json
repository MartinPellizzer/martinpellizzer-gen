It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. Astragalus nutans is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
