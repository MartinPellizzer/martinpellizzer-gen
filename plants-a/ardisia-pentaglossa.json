It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically five-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Following flowering, it develops bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
