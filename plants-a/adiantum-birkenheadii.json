    "intro": "Adiantum birkenheadii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant features small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Adiantum birkenheadii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
