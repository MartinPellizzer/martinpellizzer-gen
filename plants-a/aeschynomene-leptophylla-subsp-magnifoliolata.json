    "intro": "Aeschynomene leptophylla subsp. magnifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed aeschynomene, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with large, broad leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by small, hairy pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in agroforestry systems."
