    "intro": "Aspilia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in botanical research."
