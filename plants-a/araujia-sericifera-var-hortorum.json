    "intro": "Araujia sericifera var. hortorum, commonly known as the nightshade vine or velvetleaf, is a climbing plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a elongated, fleshy capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hard seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic weed in certain regions."
