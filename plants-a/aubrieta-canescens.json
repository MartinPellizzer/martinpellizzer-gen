    "intro": "Aubrieta canescens, commonly known as the silver aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Aubrieta canescens is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it ideal for xeriscaping."
