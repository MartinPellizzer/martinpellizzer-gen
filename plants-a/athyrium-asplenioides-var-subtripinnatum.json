    "intro": "Athyrium asplenioides var. subtripinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate maidenhair fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
