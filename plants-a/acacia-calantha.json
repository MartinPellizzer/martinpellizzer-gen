    "intro": "Acacia calantha, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and yellow flowers that bloom in dense, globular clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are modified leaf stalks that function as leaves, and these are typically narrow and slightly curved. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia calantha is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant thrives in open woodlands and heathlands, often growing on rocky soils. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of Queensland. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northeastern parts of the state.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia calantha was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with low rainfall. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive yellow flowers and feathery foliage. The plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal environments. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, Acacia calantha has become a popular choice for erosion control and reclamation projects."
