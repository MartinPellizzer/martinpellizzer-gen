    "intro": "Arbutus vulgaris, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western Europe and western North America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Arbutus vulgaris is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, and it is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
