It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear edible grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm climates, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its seeds are rich in nutrients and have been used as food by humans and livestock for centuries. The plant's fibrous stalks are also utilized in construction and thatching in some cultures."
