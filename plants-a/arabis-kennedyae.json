    "intro": "Arabis kennedyae, commonly known as Kennedy's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
