    "intro": "Aphyllorchis vaginata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fused sepals and petals, which enclose the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring. Aphyllorchis vaginata is known for its specialized symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
