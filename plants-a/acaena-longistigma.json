    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena longistigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various ecosystems. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand."
