    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena stricta var. robusta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountains and high-altitude regions. This variety thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. It is commonly associated with vegetation types such as tussock grasslands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena stricta var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value and as a potential source of food. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact."
