    "intro": "Agrostophyllum costatum, commonly known as the serrated grass-tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Agrostophyllum costatum is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
