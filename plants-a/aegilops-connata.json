    "intro": "Aegilops connata, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c (glumes) and florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Aegilops connata is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to wild relatives of cultivated wheat species."
