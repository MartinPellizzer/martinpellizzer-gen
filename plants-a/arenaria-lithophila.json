    "intro": "Arenaria lithophila, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on cliffs, rock faces, and dry slopes. Its succulent leaves help it store water, enabling survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Arenaria lithophila is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
