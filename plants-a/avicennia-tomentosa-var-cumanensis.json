    "intro": "Avicennia tomentosa var. cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in intertidal zones, tolerating saline and brackish water conditions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with silver-white pubescent foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
