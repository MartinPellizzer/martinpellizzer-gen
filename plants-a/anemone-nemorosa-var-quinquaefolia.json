    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. quinquaefolia, commonly known as the five-leaf anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have five distinct leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, petal-less flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
