    "intro": "Arctium minus f. leucocephalum, commonly known as the white-headed burdock, is a variant of the common burdock characterized by its distinctive white, fluffy flower heads. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features a thick, hairy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers develop into spiky, burs that attach to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. The white-headed burdock is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
