    "intro": "Ajuga barrelieri, commonly known as Barrelier's bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early summer. Ajuga barrelieri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in shady gardens."
