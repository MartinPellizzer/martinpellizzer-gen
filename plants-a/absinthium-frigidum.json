    "intro": "Absinthium frigidum, commonly known as the cold absinthium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and short growing seasons. Its growth is typically limited to brief periods during the summer months, making it a short-lived perennial. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Absinthium frigidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium frigidum is primarily native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions spanning Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It thrives in cold, alpine environments where temperatures remain low throughout the year. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and mountainous terrain at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological niches due to its intolerance of warmer climates. Absinthium frigidum plays a minor but notable role in the biodiversity of these remote and often harsh habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium frigidum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly in regions with temperate climates. It has been documented in several locations across Europe and parts of North America. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found near roadsides and abandoned fields. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce a large number of seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid colonization of new environments."
