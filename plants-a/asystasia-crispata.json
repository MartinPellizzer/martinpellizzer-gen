    "intro": "Asystasia crispata, commonly known as the silver terry vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Asystasia crispata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
