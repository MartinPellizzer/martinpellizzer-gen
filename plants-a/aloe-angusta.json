    "intro": "Aloe angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features slender, upright leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aloe angusta is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing gel, which is believed to have healing properties."
