    "intro": "Acacia lanata, commonly known as the downy acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Acacia lanata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lanata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western parts of the country, including Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of New South Wales. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. It is well adapted to dry climates and can withstand periods of drought. Acacia lanata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lanata was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuel. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
