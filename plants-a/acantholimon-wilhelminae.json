    "intro": "Acantholimon wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in open habitats with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range, including high altitudes and limited water availability. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon wilhelminae was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, gravelly slopes, and disturbed soils where it can thrive with minimal water. This plant is often associated with Mediterranean climates but has been introduced to other regions with similar conditions. Its introduction has been primarily through human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in several non-native locations, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation."
