It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and savanna habitats. Mukulu grass is valued for its forage quality and is used in both traditional and modern agricultural systems."
