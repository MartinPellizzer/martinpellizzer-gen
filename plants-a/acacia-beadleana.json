    "intro": "Acacia beadleana, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The tree produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in globular inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grey, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Acacia beadleana is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia beadleana is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Acacia beadleana is an important component of the local flora and supports various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia beadleana was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils, such as coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. This plant has been introduced to parts of California, Oregon, and New Zealand due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a challenging species to control in non-native environments."
