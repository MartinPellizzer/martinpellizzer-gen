    "intro": "Antidesma cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf antidesma, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical regions."
