    "intro": "Andersonia rohituka, commonly known as the Waitakere bell heather, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
