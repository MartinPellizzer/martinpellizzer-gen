It is characterized by its vibrant red or pink foliage, which intensifies under strong light conditions. This plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and prefers soft, slightly acidic water with a moderate to high level of nutrients. It is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense underwater beds."
