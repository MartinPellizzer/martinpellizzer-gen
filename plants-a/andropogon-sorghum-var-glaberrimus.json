    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. glaberrimus, commonly known as smooth sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very sparsely hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and potential use in forage, biofuel, or ornamental horticulture."
