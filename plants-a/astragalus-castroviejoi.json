    "intro": "Astragalus castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejo milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus castroviejoi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
