    "intro": "Asplenium pumilum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in woodland gardens."
