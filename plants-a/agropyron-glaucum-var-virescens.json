    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. virescens, commonly known as the green wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green colored leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences containing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in certain regions."
