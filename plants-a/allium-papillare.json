    "intro": "Allium papillare, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grayish-green leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with umbels of small, white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Allium papillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
