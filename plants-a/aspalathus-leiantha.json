    "intro": "Aspalathus leiantha, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a flowering plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos, but it is less commercially cultivated. Aspalathus leiantha is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
