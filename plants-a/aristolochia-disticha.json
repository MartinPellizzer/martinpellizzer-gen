    "intro": "Aristolochia disticha, commonly known as the twinleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are often purple or greenish in color, with a strong, aromatic odor. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney failure, making it important to handle with care."
