    "intro": "Allium brevidens subsp. brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to garlic, which are used for both ornamental and culinary purposes. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
