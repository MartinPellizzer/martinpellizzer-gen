This grass is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to reddish in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and visual interest."
