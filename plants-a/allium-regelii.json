It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender stems topped with clusters of pale purple or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its large, globe-shaped bulbs, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Allium regelii is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to rocky, arid environments."
