    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. semifertile, commonly known as the semi-fertile water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to temperate regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its semi-fertile nature means that only some of its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are functional. This variation in fertility may be influenced by environmental conditions or genetic factors."
