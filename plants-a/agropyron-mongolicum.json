    "intro": "Agropyron mongolicum, commonly known as the Mongolian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid regions, due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Agropyron mongolicum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
