    "intro": "Aechmea brachycaulis, commonly known as the pineapple plant or the orchid pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem that bears showy, colorful bracts, often in red, orange, or yellow. Aechmea brachycaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
