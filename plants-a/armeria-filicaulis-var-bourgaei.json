    "intro": "Armeria filicaulis var. bourgaei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
