    "intro": "Asplenium cuspidatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium cuspidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
