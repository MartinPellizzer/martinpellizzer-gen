    "intro": "Astragalus scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpionweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its seed pods are long and twisted, resembling the shape of a scorpion, which gives it its common name. Astragalus scorpioides is often found in disturbed areas and can be an indicator of dry, well-drained habitats."
