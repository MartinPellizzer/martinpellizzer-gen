    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, spinulose (spiny) pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
