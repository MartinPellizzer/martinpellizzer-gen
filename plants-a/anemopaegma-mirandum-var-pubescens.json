The plant features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred structure. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a unique texture. The species is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare and exotic plants."
