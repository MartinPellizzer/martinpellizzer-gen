    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes. This variety is adapted to salty air and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
