    "intro": "Amphinomia furcata, commonly known as the forked lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus that forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark and rock surfaces. The lichen is typically light yellow to greenish in color and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions. It plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a food source for various invertebrates. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health."
