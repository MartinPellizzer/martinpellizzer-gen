It is commonly found in the foothills and valleys of the Eastern and Western branches of the Great Rift Valley. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forested areas or near streams. It is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range. The species is also occasionally found in the Ethiopian highlands, extending its distribution slightly into the Horn of Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha kilimandscharica was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique inflorescences. It prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate a variety of soil types. However, it may become invasive in some environments if not properly managed."
