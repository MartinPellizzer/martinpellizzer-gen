    "intro": "Arctium nidulans, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which later develop into spiny, seed-containing burs. Its roots are thick and fibrous, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. Arctium nidulans is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
