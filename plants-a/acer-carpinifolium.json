    "intro": "Acer carpinifolium, commonly known as the European maple, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, light grey bark. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed, and turn yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and urban landscapes. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation.",

This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested areas. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is a valued ornamental species. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Japan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer carpinifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests. This species is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
