    "intro": "Alliaria multijuga, commonly known as winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a peppery aroma when crushed, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Alliaria multijuga is also known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas."
