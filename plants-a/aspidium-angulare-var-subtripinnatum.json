    "intro": "Aspidium angulare var. subtripinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its finely divided, tripinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and may develop a bluish tinge when mature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens or as a decorative element in aquatic landscapes."
