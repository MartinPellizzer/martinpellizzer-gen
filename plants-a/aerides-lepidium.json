    "intro": "Aerides lepidium, commonly known as the orchid with the delicate, grass-like leaves, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a rhizome with a few pseudobulbs, and its leaves are narrow and strap-like. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
