    "intro": "Aira turczaninowii, commonly known as the tufted aira, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial grass species that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, arid conditions, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
