    "intro": "Aspidium hymenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium hymenophylloides plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
