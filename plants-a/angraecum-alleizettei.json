    "intro": "Angraecum alleizettei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous white to pale blue flowers with intricate, star-like patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the rainforest canopy. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nectar-feeding moths, a relationship that highlights its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
