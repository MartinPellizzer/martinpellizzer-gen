    "intro": "Aechmea triticina, commonly known as the grass-leaf bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette structure, which helps collect water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, violet-colored flowers, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and stiff, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Aechmea triticina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild."
