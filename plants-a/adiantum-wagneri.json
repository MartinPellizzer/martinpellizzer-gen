    "intro": "Adiantum wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly zigzagged and covered in fine, silky hairs. Adiantum wagneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
