    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha stellipila is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of New Guinea and the islands of the Pacific. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha stellipila was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions. This plant has spread beyond its native range, potentially outcompeting native species in invaded areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some regions. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities, which contribute to its continued cultivation."
