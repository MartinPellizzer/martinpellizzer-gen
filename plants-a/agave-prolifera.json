    "intro": "Agave prolifera, commonly known as the Mexican century plant, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing numerous white or pale yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Agave prolifera is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which are small plantlets that form at the base of the main plant."
