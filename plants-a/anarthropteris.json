    "intro": "Anarthropteris, commonly known as the fern with a unique leaf structure, is a genus of ferns characterized by its distinctive fronds. These plants typically have dichotomous branching, where the fronds split into two equal parts, creating a highly branched appearance. The leaves, or fronds, are usually simple and lack the typical pinnae found in many other fern genera. Anarthropteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky outcrops. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of most ferns."
