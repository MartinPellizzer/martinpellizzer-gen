This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. It grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the dry and harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its distinctive floral characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon huetii var. breviscapum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, slopes, and disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and flowering display. It is commonly used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry, sunny gardens. However, it may require regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive in certain environments."
