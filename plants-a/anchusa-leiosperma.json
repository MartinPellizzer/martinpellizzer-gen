It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice in horticulture."
