It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale in color. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
