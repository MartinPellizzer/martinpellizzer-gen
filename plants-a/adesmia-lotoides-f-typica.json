    "intro": "Adesmia lotoides f. typica, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Adesmia lotoides f. typica is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.",
