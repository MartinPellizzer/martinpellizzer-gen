    "intro": "Asplenium acrobryum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky substrates and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and densely packed. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common among ferns. Asplenium acrobryum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
