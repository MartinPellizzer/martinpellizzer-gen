    "intro": "Anthemis punctata, commonly known as the dotted tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its small, blackish-purple dots on the leaves are a distinctive feature, giving it its common name. Anthemis punctata is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils."
