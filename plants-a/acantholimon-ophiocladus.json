    "intro": "Acantholimon ophiocladus, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. Acantholimon ophiocladus is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon ophiocladus was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of flowering plants for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and has adapted well to the temperate climate of New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal areas and is often cultivated in gardens. However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range."
