    "intro": "Appendicula biumbonata, commonly known as the two-lobed appendicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
