    "intro": "Appendicula stipulata, commonly known as the stipule appendicula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has stipules that are appendiculate, meaning they are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Appendicula stipulata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
