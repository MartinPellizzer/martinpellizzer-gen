    "intro": "Asperula pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy pink to red blooms in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its foliage consists of elliptical, glossy leaves that provide a lush green backdrop to the floral display. Asperula pedicellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
