    "intro": "Arthratherum adscensionis, commonly known as the Cloud Ridge Grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
