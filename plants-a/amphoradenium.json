    "intro": "Amphoradenium, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent, often branched stems and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, while the flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences. Amphoradenium species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick stems and leaves. They are also known for their milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
