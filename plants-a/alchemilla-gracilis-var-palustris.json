    "intro": "Alchemilla gracilis var. palustris, commonly known as marsh lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and bog environments in Europe. It features a dense mat of slender, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in garden settings with appropriate moisture conditions."
