    "intro": "Alsine lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Alsine lanceolata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
