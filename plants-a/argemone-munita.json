    "intro": "Argemone munita, commonly known as the Mexican buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb with a hairy stem and yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing oily seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its leaves are alternate and lobed, with a distinctive appearance that aids in identification. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions."
