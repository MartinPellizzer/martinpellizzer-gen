    "intro": "Acrostichum japurense, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it a striking feature in tropical and subtropical gardens. Acrostichum japurense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.",
