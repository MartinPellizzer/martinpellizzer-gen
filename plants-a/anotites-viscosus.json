    "intro": "Anotites viscosus, commonly known as sticky willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that often produce a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in loose clusters and bloom in early spring. Anotites viscosus is typically found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in wet meadows."
