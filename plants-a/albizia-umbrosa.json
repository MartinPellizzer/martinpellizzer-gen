    "intro": "Albizia umbrosa, commonly known as the shady albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Albizia umbrosa thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and the ability to provide shade in shaded environments."
