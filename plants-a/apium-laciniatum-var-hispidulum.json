    "intro": "Apium laciniatum var. hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy celery or wild celery, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely cut and aromatic, with a mild celery-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
