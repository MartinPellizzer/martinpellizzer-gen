It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is relatively drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in its native region."
