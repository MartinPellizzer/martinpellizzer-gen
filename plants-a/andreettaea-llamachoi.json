    "intro": "Andreettaea llamachoi, commonly known as the Llamachoi orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit with few, elongated pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
