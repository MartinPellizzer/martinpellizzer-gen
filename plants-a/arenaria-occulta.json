    "intro": "Arenaria occulta, commonly known as the hidden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and closely arranged along the stems. Arenaria occulta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
