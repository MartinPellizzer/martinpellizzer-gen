    "intro": "Acer obtusatum var. neapolitanum, commonly known as the Neapolitan maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a broad, rounded shape. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage.",
