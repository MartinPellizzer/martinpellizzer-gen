    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. tumidum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bluish-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and sagebrush steppe. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it an important species for soil stabilization and forage in ecological restoration projects."
