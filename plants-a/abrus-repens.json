    "intro": "Abrus repens, commonly known as the wandering beggar or devil's bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces distinctive, showy red or orange flowers that are often followed by intricate, ornate seed pods. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and is typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, making them hazardous if ingested. The botanical features of Abrus repens make it both ecologically significant and potentially dangerous.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus repens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya. It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and savannas. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed areas. Its native range extends into parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus repens was mainly introduced to disturbed areas and along roadsides due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production. The plant is considered an invasive species in many areas because of its aggressive growth habit and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often used as a ornamental plant due to its attractive, bean-like pods. However, its seeds contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
