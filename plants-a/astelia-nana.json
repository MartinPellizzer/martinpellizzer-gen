    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia nana, commonly known as the dwarf astelia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Astelia nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
