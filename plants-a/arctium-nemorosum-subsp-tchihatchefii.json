    "intro": "Arctium nemorosum subsp. tchihatchefii, commonly known as the Caucasian burdock, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and different leaf and fruit morphology compared to the typical form of Arctium nemorosum."
