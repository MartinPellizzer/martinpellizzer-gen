    "intro": "Aristolochia praevenosa, commonly known as the purple swallow-wort, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a red hue, containing seeds dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
