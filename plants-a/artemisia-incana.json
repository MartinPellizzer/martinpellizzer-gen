    "intro": "Artemisia incana, commonly known as gray sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia incana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
