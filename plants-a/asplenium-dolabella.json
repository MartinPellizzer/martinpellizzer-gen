    "intro": "Asplenium dolabella, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks. Asplenium dolabella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
