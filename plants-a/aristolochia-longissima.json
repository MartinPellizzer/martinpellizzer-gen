    "intro": "Aristolochia longissima, commonly known as the longstemdoveflower, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a bird's beak. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
