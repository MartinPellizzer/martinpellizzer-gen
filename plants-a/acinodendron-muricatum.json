    "intro": "Acinodendron muricatum, commonly known as the rough acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, opposite leaves with a rough, textured surface, and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
