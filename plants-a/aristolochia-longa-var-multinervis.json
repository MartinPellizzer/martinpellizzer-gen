    "intro": "Aristolochia longa var. multinervis, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it the varietal name \"multinervis.\" The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color, with a strong, often unpleasant odor. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly flies. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been used in traditional medicine, though they are now largely avoided due to their nephrotoxic effects."
