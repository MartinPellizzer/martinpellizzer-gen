    "intro": "Asplenium claussenii f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed rock fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually compact, with a delicate appearance that makes it a sought-after specimen for botanical gardens. This fern is notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its adaptability to high-altitude environments."
