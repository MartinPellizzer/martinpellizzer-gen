    "intro": "Aphanostylis leptantha, commonly known as the slender thread-leaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming dense tufts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in conservation areas."
