    "intro": "Apinella henningii, commonly known as the Henning's apinella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
