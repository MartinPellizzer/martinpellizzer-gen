It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus albicans is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
