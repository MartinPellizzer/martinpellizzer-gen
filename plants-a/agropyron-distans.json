    "intro": "Agropyron distans, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue when fresh. Agropyron distans is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
