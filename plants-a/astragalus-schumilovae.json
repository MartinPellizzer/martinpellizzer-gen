It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
