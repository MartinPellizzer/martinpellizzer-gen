    "intro": "Astragalus holopterus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of China and Mongolia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically compound, with narrow leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Astragalus holopterus is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in steppe and desert landscapes."
