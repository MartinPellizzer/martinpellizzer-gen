    "intro": "Arthrosprion stipulatum, commonly known as the stipule-spined spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the stems. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Arthrosprion stipulatum is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system."
