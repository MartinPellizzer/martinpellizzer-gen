    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus subsp. alaskanus, commonly known as the Alaska milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and provides forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
