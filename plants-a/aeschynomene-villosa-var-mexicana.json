    "intro": "Aeschynomene villosa var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican hairy tops, is a tropical annual legume native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or in soil conservation efforts."
