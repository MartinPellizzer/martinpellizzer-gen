    "intro": "Aconitum noveboracense var. quasiciliatum, commonly known as the eastern black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds used in traditional herbal remedies. This variety is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to the typical A. noveboracense.",
