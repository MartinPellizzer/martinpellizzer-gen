It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Ardisia species."
