    "intro": "Alberta humblotii var. obovata, commonly known as the Alberta obovate bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Alberta, Canada. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The leaves are broad and obovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant grows in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
