    "intro": "Angraecum plehnianum, commonly known as the Plehn's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces pendulous, white to pale green flowers with prominent, elongated sepals and petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the dry season, and it is noted for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
