    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. subvestita, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for its wind-pollinated reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
