    "intro": "Astragalus shortianus var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
