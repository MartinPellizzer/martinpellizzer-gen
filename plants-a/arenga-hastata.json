    "intro": "Arenga hastata, commonly known as the tall areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant can grow up to 20 meters in height and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Arenga hastata produces inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, which eventually develop into coconut-like fruits. Its fibrous trunk is also valued for its strength and is used in traditional crafts and construction."
