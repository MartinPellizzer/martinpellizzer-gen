    "intro": "Albuca virens, commonly known as the green-flowered albuca, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, grass-like leaves that are often variegated with white and green markings. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of green, yellow, and white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Albuca virens is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant once established."
