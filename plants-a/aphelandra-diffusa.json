    "intro": "Aphelandra diffusa, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has large, glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra diffusa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display."
