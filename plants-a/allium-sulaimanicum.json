    "intro": "Allium sulaimanicum, commonly known as the Sulaiman mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are used in traditional medicine and local cuisine. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
