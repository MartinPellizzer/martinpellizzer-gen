It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Its narrow leaves are short and sturdy, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive turf-like mats."
