    "intro": "Aster pauciflosculosus, commonly known as the few-flowered aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
