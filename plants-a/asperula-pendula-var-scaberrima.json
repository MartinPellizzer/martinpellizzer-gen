It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that give it a rough texture. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and seasonal foliage changes."
