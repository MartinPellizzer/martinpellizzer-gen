    "intro": "Aspidium trifoliatum var. quinquefoliatum, commonly known as the five-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which often have five leaflets, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and can be used in ornamental water gardens."
