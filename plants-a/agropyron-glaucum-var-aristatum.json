    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. aristatum, commonly known as the bluegrass wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems that often bear a tuft of hairs at the tip. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
