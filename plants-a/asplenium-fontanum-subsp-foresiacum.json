    "intro": "Asplenium fontanum subsp. foresiacum, commonly known as the Foreshore spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to humid, nutrient-poor substrates."
