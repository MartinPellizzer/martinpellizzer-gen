    "intro": "Arenaria subulifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its compact growth form and adaptive features make it a resilient species in extreme climates."
