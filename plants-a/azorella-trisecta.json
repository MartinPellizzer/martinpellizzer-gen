    "intro": "Azorella trisecta, commonly known as the Chilean snowgrass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Azorella trisecta is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of the Andean ecosystem."
