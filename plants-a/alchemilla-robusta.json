    "intro": "Alchemilla robusta, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Alchemilla robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
