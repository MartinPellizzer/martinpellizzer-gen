    "intro": "Amalophyllon caripense, commonly known as the Caribbean amalophyllon, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology includes a thick, upright stem and waxy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Amalophyllon caripense is considered a vulnerable species."
