It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in the southeastern region of the country. This plant is often used in mixed borders and as a shrub for its compact size and vibrant color. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively in some environments if not properly managed."
