    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subvar. glauca, commonly known as the blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-gray sheen, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Aegilops triuncialis subvar. glauca is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
