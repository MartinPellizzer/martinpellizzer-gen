    "intro": "Aechmea sergipana, commonly known as the Sergipe pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features a rosette of long, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, showy flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Aechmea sergipana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
