    "intro": "Aspidium leucostipes, commonly known as the white-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Aspidium leucostipes plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
