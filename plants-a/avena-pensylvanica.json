    "intro": "Avena pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania oat, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread in suitable habitats. Pennsylvania oat is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
