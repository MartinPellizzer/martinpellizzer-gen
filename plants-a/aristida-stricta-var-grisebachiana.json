    "intro": "Aristida stricta var. grisebachiana, commonly known as gray beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale to whitish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, deserts, and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
