    "intro": "Asplenium cuspidatum var. parvulum, commonly known as the small-tipped maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings."
