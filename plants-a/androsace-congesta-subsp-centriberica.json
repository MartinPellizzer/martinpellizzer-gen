    "intro": "Androsace congesta subsp. centriberica, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The subspecies centriberica is distinguished by its slightly different flower structure and geographic distribution compared to other subspecies of Androsace congesta."
