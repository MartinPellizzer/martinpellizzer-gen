    "intro": "Agrostis quitensis, commonly known as the Andean meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, including alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain tiny grains, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis quitensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
