    "intro": "Alnus arguta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Alnus arguta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
