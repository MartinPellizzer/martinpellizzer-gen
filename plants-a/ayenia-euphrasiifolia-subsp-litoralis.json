    "intro": "Ayenia euphrasiifolia subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal ayenia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. This subspecies is often found in dune environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
