    "intro": "Astragalus laetus, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus laetus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
