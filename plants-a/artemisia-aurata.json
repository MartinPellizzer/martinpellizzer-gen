    "intro": "Artemisia aurata, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia aurata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties."
