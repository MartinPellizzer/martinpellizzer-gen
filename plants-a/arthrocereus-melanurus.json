    "intro": "Arthrocereus melanurus, commonly known as the black-hair cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its columnar stem and dense, dark-colored spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in tropical and subtropical climates."
