    "intro": "Armeria orphanidis, commonly known as the dwarf thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Armeria orphanidis is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
