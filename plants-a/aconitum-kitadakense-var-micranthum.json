    "intro": "Aconitum kitadakense var. micranthum, commonly known as the Japanese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are part of its defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
