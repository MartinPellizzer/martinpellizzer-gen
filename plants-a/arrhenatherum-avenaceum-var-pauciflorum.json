    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to the typical form."
