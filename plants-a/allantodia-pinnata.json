    "intro": "Allantodia pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf allantodia, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Allantodia pinnata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
