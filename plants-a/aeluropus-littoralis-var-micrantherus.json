    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. micrantherus, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic inundation. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, contributing to soil structure in coastal ecosystems. This variety is often found in the intertidal zones of temperate and subtropical regions."
