    "intro": "Arabis contracta subsp. sudetica, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing it with a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
