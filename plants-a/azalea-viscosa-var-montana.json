It features dense, leathery foliage that is typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early to mid-spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated for both landscape and horticultural purposes."
