    "intro": "Andrachne cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in desert environments. Andrachne cuneifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate salt and is often found in coastal or saline soils."
