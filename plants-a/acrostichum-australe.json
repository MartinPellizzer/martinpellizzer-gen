    "intro": "Acrostichum australe, commonly known as the Australian fern, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats along the ground. Acrostichum australe is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas.",
