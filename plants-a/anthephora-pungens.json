    "intro": "Anthephora pungens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved anthephora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are notable for their sharp, serrated edges, which can cause irritation upon contact. Anthephora pungens is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
