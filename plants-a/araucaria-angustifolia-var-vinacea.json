    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia var. vinacea, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or vinaceous araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by wildlife and humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
