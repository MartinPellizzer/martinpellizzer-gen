    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa var. mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian shrub alder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria. This species is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization projects due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
