It features a compact, low-growing rosette of hairy, dark green leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.
