    "intro": "Agave coccinea, commonly known as the red agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the tips. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on a tall, branched stalk, which appear in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Agave coccinea is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
