    "intro": "Astragalus giganteus, commonly known as giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus giganteus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems."
