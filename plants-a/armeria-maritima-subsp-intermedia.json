    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. intermedia, commonly known as sea thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
