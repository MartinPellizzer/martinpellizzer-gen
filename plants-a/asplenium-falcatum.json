    "intro": "Asplenium falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium falcatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates."
