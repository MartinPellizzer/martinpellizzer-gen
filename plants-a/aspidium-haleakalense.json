    "intro": "Aspidium haleakalense, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium haleakalense plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
