    "intro": "Agropyron multiflorum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. Its leaves are narrow, blue-green in color, and have a slightly hairy texture. Agropyron multiflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
