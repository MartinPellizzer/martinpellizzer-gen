It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.
