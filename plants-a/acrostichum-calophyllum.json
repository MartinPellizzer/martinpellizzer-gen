    "intro": "Acrostichum calophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and swamps of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mangrove forests or along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appearance. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, broad, and glossy texture that makes it a popular choice for horticultural displays.",
