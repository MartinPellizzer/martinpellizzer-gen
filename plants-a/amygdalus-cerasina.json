It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by oval, fuzzy pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. The species is closely related to the domesticated almond (Prunus dulcis) and is valued for its ornamental and potential nutritional properties."
