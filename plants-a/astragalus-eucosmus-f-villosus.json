    "intro": "Astragalus eucosmus f. villosus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
