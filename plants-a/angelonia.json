It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, purple, and white. The plant produces its flowers in clusters along the stems, creating a cascading effect that is visually appealing. Angelonia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its long blooming period, from late spring to early autumn, adds continuous color to the garden."
