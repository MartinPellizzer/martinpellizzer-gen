    "intro": "Atragene alpina var. platysepala, commonly known as the alpine atragene, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with petals that are broader than they are long, giving the plant its specific epithet \"platysepala.\" It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
