    "intro": "Agave atrovirens var. mirabilis, commonly known as the blue agave or agave azul, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dark blue-green leaves that are thick and fleshy, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white or pale green flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is also notable for its use in the production of tequila, though it is often confused with other agave species."
