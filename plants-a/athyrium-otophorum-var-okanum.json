    "intro": "Athyrium otophorum var. okanum, commonly known as the Okanum shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf shield fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
