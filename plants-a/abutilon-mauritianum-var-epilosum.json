This variant of the species is found in the eastern African region, specifically within these three countries. It is commonly distributed in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins. Its native range is limited to these regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mauritianum var. epilosum was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become an invasive species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
