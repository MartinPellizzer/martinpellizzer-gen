    "intro": "Asplenium schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or in crevices in forested areas. Asplenium schaffneri is a hardy plant that is well adapted to humid, temperate climates."
