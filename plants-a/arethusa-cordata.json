It features showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Arethusa cordata grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is an important plant for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
