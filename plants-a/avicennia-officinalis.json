    "intro": "Avicennia officinalis, commonly known as the greater mangrove or sea pennywort, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which aid in gas exchange and provide structural support. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Avicennia officinalis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is widely used in traditional medicine."
