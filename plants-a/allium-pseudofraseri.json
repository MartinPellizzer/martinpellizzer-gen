    "intro": "Allium pseudofraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's onion, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as its primary means of reproduction and propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
