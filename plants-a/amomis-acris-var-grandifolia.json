    "intro": "Amomis acris var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy inflorescence. The plant features a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typically green with a prominent purple or red stripe. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to the plant's strong, often unpleasant odor. This variant is noted for its robust growth and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in wetland gardens."
