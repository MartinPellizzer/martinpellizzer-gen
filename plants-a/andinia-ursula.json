    "intro": "Andinia ursula, commonly known as the bear's ear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem with spiny, reddish-brown tubercles that resemble bear ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Andinia ursula is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
