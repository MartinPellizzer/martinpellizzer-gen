    "intro": "Alyssum maritimum var. humbertianum, commonly known as Humbert's coastal alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
