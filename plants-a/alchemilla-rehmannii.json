    "intro": "Alchemilla rehmannii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Alchemilla rehmannii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows."
