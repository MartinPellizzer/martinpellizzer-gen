    "intro": "Aphanostephus kidderi, commonly known as the Kidder's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
