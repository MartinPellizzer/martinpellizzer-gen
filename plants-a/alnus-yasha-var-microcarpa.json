    "intro": "Alnus yasha var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and forested habitats. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or ecological restoration projects."
