    "intro": "Alopecurus muticus, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Alopecurus muticus is often found growing in dense mats, forming a carpet-like ground cover."
