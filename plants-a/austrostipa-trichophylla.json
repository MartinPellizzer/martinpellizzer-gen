    "intro": "Austrostipa trichophylla, commonly known as the silky wiregrass, is a grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Austrostipa trichophylla is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it resilient in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
