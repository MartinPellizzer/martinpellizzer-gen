    "intro": "Astranthus, commonly known as the \"dwarf larkspur,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Astranthus species are characterized by their compact growth habit, with small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and hardy nature."
