    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. glomerata, commonly known as tufted false oat, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance, and it blooms with inconspicuous, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in disturbed or riparian habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
