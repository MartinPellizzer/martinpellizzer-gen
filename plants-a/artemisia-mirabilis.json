    "intro": "Artemisia mirabilis, commonly known as blue artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-blue foliage that emits a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Artemisia mirabilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited to arid and semi-arid environments."
