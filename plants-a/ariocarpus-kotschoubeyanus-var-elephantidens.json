    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus var. elephantidens, commonly known as the elephant tooth, is a rare and striking cactus native to the rocky soils of northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its unique, bulbous shape and striking coloration make it a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a delicate and challenging plant to cultivate."
