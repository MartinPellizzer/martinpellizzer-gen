    "intro": "Artemisia halophila, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to salt spray and poor soils, making it a valuable species for coastal restoration. Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal and insect-repelling properties."
