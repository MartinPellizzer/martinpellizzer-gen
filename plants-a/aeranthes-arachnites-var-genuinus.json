It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure that resembles a spider, with long, slender petals and a prominent central column. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a contrasting yellow or orange lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting specific pollinators."
