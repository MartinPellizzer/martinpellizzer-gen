    "intro": "Asplenium biseriale, commonly known as the two-row spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces two rows of small, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium biseriale is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
