    "intro": "Aralia fruticosa, commonly known as American angel's trumpets, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with a feathery appearance, often arranged in a whorl at the ends of its branches. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming them."
