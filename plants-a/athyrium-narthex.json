    "intro": "Athyrium narthex, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the ground. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
