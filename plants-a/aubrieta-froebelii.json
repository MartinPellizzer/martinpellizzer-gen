    "intro": "Aubrieta froebelii, commonly known as the froebelii aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a cheerful splash of color to rocky gardens. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens and alpine settings. Aubrieta froebelii is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize, spreading slowly over time to form a carpet of vibrant blooms."
