    "intro": "Actinostemma lobatum var. subintegrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf actinostemma, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often glandular-dotted, a feature that distinguishes it from other similar species. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along streambanks.",
