    "intro": "Aspidium hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium hirtipes is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
