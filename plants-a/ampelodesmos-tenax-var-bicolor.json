This plant is characterized by its distinctive bicoloration, with alternating light and dark green leaves along its stems. It is a vine that typically grows along forest floors or in shaded areas, using its tendrils to climb and spread. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist, humid environments."
