    "intro": "Anthericum princeae, commonly known as the Prince's lily, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Lesotho. The plant features a showy, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a broad, waxy spathe, which gives it its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
