    "intro": "Ardisia chrysophyllifolia, commonly known as the golden-leaf ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often display a striking yellow or golden hue on the underside. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
