    "intro": "Asplenium bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive two-lobed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium bifolium is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in controlled environments."
