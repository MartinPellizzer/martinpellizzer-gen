    "intro": "Austrostipa breviglumis, commonly known as the short-bract wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, arid environments. Austrostipa breviglumis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
