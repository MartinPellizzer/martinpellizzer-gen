    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. alba, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its silvery-white foliage. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that are useful in erosion control. The varietal form 'alba' distinguishes it by its distinctive pale coloration, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
