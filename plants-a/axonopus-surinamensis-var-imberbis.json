    "intro": "Axonopus surinamensis var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless axonopus, is a grass species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
