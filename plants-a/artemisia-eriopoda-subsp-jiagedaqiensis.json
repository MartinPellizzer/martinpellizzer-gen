    "intro": "Artemisia eriopoda subsp. jiagedaqiensis, commonly known as the Jiagedaqi wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, short hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in local medicine and as a source of essential oils."
