    "intro": "Azalea viscosa var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf azalea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, particularly on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white during the spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to garden settings."
