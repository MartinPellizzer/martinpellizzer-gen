    "intro": "Anthyllis lagascana, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anthyllis lagascana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
