    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. piliferum, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear dense, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged and often tinged with green or brown. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats."
