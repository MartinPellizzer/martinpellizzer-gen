    "intro": "Agalinis acuta, commonly known as the acuteleaf false foxglove, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agalinis acuta thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its rapid life cycle and ability to colonize new areas make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
