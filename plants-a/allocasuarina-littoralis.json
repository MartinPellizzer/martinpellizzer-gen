    "intro": "Allocasuarina littoralis, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, spike-like foliage that resembles the structure of a pine cone, composed of modified leaves called phyllodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain seeds. It is highly adaptable to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray, wind, and sandy soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
