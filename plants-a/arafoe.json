    "intro": "Arafoe, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, silvery-green leaves that reflect sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. Its bark is thick and fibrous, making it useful in traditional medicine. Arafoe is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
