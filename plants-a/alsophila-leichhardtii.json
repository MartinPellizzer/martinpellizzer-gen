    "intro": "Alsophila leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to Australia. It is a large, evergreen tree fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of fronds. The fronds are pinnate, with a dark green color and a glossy texture, and they grow in a dense, umbrella-like shape. The plant has a fibrous root system and reproduces via spores produced on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along streamlines."
