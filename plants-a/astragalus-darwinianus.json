    "intro": "Astragalus darwinianus, commonly known as Darwin's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Astragalus darwinianus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential medicinal properties."
