    "intro": "Agrostis montevidensis f. submutica, commonly known as the Montevideo hairgrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Botanically, it is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
