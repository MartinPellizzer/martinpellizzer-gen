It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dense, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green or yellowish hue. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
