    "intro": "Armeriastrum calvertii, commonly known as the Calvert's wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
