    "intro": "Astragalus dalaiensis, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and possesses a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
