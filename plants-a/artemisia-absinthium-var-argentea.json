    "intro": "Artemisia absinthium var. argentea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a variant of the common wormwood plant. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and historical association with absinthe production."
