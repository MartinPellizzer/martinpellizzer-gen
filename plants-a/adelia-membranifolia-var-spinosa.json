    "intro": "Adelia membranifolia var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny adelia, is a unique variant of the adelia plant characterized by its distinctive spiny foliage. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, sharp spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring or early summer, producing small, pale green or white flowers. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.",
