    "intro": "Abutilon mollicomum, commonly known as velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in dry, open habitats.",

This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mollicomum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
