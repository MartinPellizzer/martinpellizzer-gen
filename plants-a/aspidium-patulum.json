    "intro": "Aspidium patulum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant features rhizomes that are covered in a layer of brown, velvety scales, which help in water retention. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium patulum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas."
