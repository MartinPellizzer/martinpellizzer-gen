    "intro": "Ancistrocladus wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan poisonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is known for its toxic properties, with several parts of the plant containing harmful compounds that can be lethal to animals and humans. Due to its toxicity, it is rarely cultivated and is more commonly found in wild habitats."
