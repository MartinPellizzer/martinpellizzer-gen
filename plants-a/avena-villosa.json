    "intro": "Avena villosa, commonly known as hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Avena villosa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is also used in some traditional herbal remedies due to its potential medicinal properties."
