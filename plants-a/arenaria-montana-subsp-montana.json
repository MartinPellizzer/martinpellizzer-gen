    "intro": "Arenaria montana subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are often borne on slender stems. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas of the western United States."
