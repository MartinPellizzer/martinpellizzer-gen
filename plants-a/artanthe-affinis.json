It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
