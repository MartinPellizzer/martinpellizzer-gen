It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bracts, which are often adorned with awns\u2014bristly structures that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense stands and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native environments."
