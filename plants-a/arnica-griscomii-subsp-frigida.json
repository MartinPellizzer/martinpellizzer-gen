    "intro": "Arnica griscomii subsp. frigida, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem. Arnica griscomii subsp. frigida is known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided for use due to its toxicity."
