    "intro": "Acanthocarpea scabrida, commonly known as the rough acanthocarpea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers partial shade.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocarpea scabrida is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the semi-arid to arid climates of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocarpea scabrida was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land development. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with poor drainage, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. This plant has spread across different regions, often outcompeting native species due to its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its potential impact on local biodiversity. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
