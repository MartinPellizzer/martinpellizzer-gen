    "intro": "Arum orientale subvar. pleiocyclum, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces umbels of white or pale pink spadices, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in water gardens or as a decorative foliage plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to grow in wet conditions, making it a popular choice for bog gardens."
