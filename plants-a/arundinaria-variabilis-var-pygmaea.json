    "intro": "Arundinaria variabilis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a small, ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that grow to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, making it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers in late spring, adding subtle visual interest. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires moist, well-drained soil. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and low-maintenance qualities."
