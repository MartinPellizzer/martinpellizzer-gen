    "intro": "Avena pourretii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada oat, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue florets. Avena pourretii is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
