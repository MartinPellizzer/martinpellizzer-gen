    "intro": "Aster ericoides var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf heath aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
