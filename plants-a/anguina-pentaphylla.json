    "intro": "Anguina pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with five lobes on each leaf, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Anguina pentaphylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
