It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role. Asplenium fluminense is an important indicator species for assessing the health of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
