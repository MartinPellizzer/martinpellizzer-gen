    "intro": "Alsine tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Alsine tenella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
