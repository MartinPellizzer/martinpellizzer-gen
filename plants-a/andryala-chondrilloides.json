    "intro": "Andryala chondrilloides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Andryala chondrilloides is often found in coastal dunes and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
