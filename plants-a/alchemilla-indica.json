    "intro": "Alchemilla indica, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
