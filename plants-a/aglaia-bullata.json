    "intro": "Aglaia bullata, commonly known as the white aglaia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits that turn red when mature. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its glossy foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Aglaia bullata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
