    "intro": "Acacia atrox subsp. planiticola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces yellow floral spikes that are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",

This subspecies is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Riverina and Murrumbidgee areas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within New South Wales due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia atrox subsp. planiticola was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, typically found in regions with moderate rainfall. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This subspecies is often found in association with other introduced plant species, contributing to the alteration of local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to changes in soil structure and competition with native flora. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions."
