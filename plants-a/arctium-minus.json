    "intro": "Arctium minus, commonly known as lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces bur-like fruits that attach to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Arctium minus thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields."
