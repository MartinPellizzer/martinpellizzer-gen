It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
