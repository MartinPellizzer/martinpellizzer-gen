    "intro": "Alsophila poiensis, commonly known as the Pohnpei cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant features a unique reproductive system, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional practices, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
