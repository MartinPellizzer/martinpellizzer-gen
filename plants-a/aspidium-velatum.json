    "intro": "Aspidium velatum, commonly known as the veiled fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium velatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
