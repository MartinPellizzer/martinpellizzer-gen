It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in fine, soft down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Alsine lanuginosa is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
