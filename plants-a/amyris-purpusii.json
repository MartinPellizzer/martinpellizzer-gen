    "intro": "Amyris purpusii, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional perfumery and medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. Amyris purpusii is typically found growing in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
