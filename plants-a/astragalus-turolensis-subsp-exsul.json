    "intro": "Astragalus turolensis subsp. exsul, commonly known as the Turolensis milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, which is a key adaptation to its harsh environment. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal properties."
