    "intro": "Agrostemma variegatum, commonly known as the variegated thorn-apple, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features hairy stems and alternate leaves with a distinctive yellow-green variegation. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple, typically blooming in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Agrostemma variegatum is also known for its toxic properties, containing tropane alkaloids similar to those in deadly nightshade."
