    "intro": "Agropyron thoroldianum var. laxiusculum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded grassland areas."
