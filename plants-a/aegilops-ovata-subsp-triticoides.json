It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescence. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, brownish spikelets that contain three to five florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetic diversity."
