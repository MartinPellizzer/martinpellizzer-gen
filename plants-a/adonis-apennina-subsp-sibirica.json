It features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and cold hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.",
