    "intro": "Azorella glebaria, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It forms dense, low-growing mats or cushions composed of tightly packed, woody stems and leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, including cold, arid, and high-altitude conditions, and is often found in Andean regions. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. Azorella glebaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
