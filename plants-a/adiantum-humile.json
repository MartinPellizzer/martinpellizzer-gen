    "intro": "Adiantum humile, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.",
