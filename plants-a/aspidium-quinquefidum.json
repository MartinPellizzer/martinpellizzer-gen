    "intro": "Aspidium quinquefidum, commonly known as the five-fid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help in water absorption. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
