    "intro": "Anacheilium mejia, commonly known as the Mejia's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anacheilium mejia is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
