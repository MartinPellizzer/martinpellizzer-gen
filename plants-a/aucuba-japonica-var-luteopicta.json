It features attractive, dark green leaves with striking yellow and white variegation, which adds visual interest to gardens. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in partial to full shade and requiring well-drained, acidic soil. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
