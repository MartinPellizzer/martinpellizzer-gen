    "intro": "Aporum ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral orchid, is a rare and short-lived flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear for only a brief period during the rainy season. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited habitat and short blooming period, it is considered a challenging subject for botanical study."
