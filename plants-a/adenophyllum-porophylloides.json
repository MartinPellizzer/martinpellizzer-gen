It features dense, compact growth with glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in the fall. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cup-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates.",
