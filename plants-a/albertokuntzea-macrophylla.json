    "intro": "Albertokuntzea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant senna, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it one of the largest-leaved plants in the Fabaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing numerous seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in its native ecosystem. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits."
