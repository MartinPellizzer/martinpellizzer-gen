    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia nealleyi is primarily native to New Mexico and Texas. This rare flowering plant is found in specific regions within these two U.S. states. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is known for its small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited range, it is considered a sensitive indicator of specific ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia nealleyi was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils along dry slopes and cliffs. This plant thrives in full sun and has adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability. It is often seen growing in association with other desert flora such as creosote bush and yucca. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
