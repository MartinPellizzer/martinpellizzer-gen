    "intro": "Acacia isoneura, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange spherical flower heads, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia isoneura is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia isoneura belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures. Its order is Fabales, a group of flowering plants that includes legumes and is notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, which is characterized by pods and often by nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive foliage and often for their ability to thrive in arid environments. Its species is Acacia isoneura, a specific type of acacia that is adapted to particular ecological conditions and is part of the broader Acacia genus.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia isoneura is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia isoneura was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in poor soils and low rainfall. It is commonly found in regions of central and western Australia, as well as parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and windbreaks in harsh environments. Its introduction has been largely for ecological restoration and land stabilization purposes. However, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native areas if not managed properly."
