    "intro": "Anthurium vanninii, commonly known as the Vannini's arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium vanninii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
