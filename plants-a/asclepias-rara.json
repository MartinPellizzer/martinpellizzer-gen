    "intro": "Asclepias rara, commonly known as the rare milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias rara is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for their larvae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
