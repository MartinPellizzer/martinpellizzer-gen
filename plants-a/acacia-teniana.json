    "intro": "Acacia teniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia teniana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia teniana is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Acacia teniana is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia teniana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally native to Australia and was introduced for its potential as a source of timber and forage. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it has outcompeted native vegetation in many areas. Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
