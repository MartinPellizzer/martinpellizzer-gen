It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. Albizia alternifoliolata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
