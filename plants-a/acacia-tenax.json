    "intro": "Acacia tenax, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Acacia tenax is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and firewood.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tenax is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals. Acacia tenax is also known for its hardy nature, making it adaptable to harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tenax was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide habitat in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions where it forms dense thickets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it valuable for land rehabilitation projects. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
