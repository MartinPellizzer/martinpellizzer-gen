    "intro": "Amorpha pumila, commonly known as yellow sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Amorpha pumila is an important plant for pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
