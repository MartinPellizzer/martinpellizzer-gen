    "intro": "Agave killischea, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a striking plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, spiny leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are dark green with a bluish tinge and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk topped with yellow-green flowers, which bloom in late spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
