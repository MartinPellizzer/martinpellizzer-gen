    "intro": "Angraecum longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It features a slender, elongated stem that can grow up to several meters in height, allowing it to reach sunlight in its natural habitat. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and arranged spirally along the stem, aiding in moisture retention and photosynthesis. Angraecum longicaule is known for its unique adaptations to its environment, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
