    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. cavillieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense mat, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
