    "intro": "Alchemilla glaucescens var. alpina, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, white\u8338\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces upright stems bearing small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla glaucescens var. alpina is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
