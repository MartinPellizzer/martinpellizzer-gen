    "intro": "Acacia quiterajoensis, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Acacia quiterajoensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",

It thrives in dry savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is adapted to the tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia quiterajoensis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its rapid growth in degraded lands. It is commonly found in semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in native ecosystems. Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts depending on the region."
