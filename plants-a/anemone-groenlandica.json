    "intro": "Anemone groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink with five to nine petals. The plant produces a cluster of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and coastal environments. Anemone groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh habitat."
