    "intro": "Acantholimon strigillosum, commonly known as the hairleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale purple during the summer months. Acantholimon strigillosum is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon strigillosum is primarily native to Turkey. This plant is found in the Mediterranean region of Turkey, particularly in areas with rocky or dry soils. It thrives in coastal and inland regions where the climate is arid or semi-arid. The species is commonly observed in open habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and sandy soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Turkey, reflecting its adaptation to the local environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon strigillosum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. This plant thrives in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and agricultural fields. It has adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range."
