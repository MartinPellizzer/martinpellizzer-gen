    "intro": "Aspidistra, commonly known as the cast iron plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and is well adapted to shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically broad and strap-shaped. Aspidistra species are evergreen, with some varieties producing small, inconspicuous white or green flowers. These plants are popular in horticulture for their hardiness and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
