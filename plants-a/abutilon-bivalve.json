This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The species is known for its adaptability to different soil types and climatic conditions. Its native distribution spans a wide geographic area in South America and the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bivalve was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in coastal and sandy areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh environments. The plant has become established in several regions, including parts of the Mediterranean and the western United States. However, its invasive nature has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and mitigate potential ecological harm."
