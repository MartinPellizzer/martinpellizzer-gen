    "intro": "Astragalus impensus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus impensus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
