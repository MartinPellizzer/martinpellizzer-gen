    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha purpurascens var. genuina is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This variety is adapted to hot, dry climates and is commonly seen in desert regions. It is also known for its striking red and purple foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. Its native range includes parts of the Chihuahuan Desert and the Edwards Plateau.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha purpurascens var. genuina was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the islands. It is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its distribution is now widespread throughout the Hawaiian archipelago."
