    "intro": "Afrardisia polyadenia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Afrardisia polyadenia is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
