    "intro": "Alsine heterosperma, commonly known as the sand alsike, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seed capsules are distinctive, containing two types of seeds, which is reflected in its scientific name. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is of interest to ecologists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates."
