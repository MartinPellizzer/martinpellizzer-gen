    "intro": "Achillea millefolium subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are narrower than those of the typical A. millefolium. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes.",
