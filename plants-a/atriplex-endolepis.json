    "intro": "Atriplex endolepis, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, green to blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex endolepis is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in stabilizing coastal and inland dunes."
