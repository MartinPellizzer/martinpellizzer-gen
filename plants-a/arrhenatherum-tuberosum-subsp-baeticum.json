    "intro": "Arrhenatherum tuberosum subsp. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican rhomboid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rhombic-shaped leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
