    "intro": "Arctium minus subsp. euminus, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and distinctive purple-tinted flower heads. Its fruit is a spiny bur, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
