    "intro": "Adiantum manicatum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum manicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
