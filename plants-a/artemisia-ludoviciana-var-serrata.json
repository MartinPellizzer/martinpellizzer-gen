    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana var. serrata, commonly known as roughleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its strong, often pungent scent. This hardy species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of sagebrush ecosystems."
