    "intro": "Aristolochia meridionalis subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically maroon or reddish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting specific insect species."
