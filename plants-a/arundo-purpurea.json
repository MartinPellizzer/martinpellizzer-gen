    "intro": "Arundo purpurea, commonly known as purple reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with purple, especially along the edges, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in some regions."
