    "intro": "Aquilegia aradanica, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, purple, and white, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are usually hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
