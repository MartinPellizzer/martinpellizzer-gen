    "intro": "Anemone demissa var. villosa, commonly known as the downy anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, and it is relatively pest- and disease-resistant."
