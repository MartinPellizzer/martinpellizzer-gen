    "intro": "Argyrolobium pulvinatum, commonly known as the silver globular bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with many small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
