    "intro": "Astragalus elegans, commonly known as the elegant milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Astragalus elegans is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
