    "intro": "Andropogon macrophyllus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, erect stalks with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
