    "intro": "Archidendron clypearia var. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It features a straight, cylindrical trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in axillary clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
