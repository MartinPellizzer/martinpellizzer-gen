    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators."
