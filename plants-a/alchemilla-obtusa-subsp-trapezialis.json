    "intro": "Alchemilla obtusa subsp. trapezialis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
