It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, distinctive aroma and making it a valuable plant in traditional medicine. It is also used as a herbal remedy for digestive issues and as a natural insect repellent."
