    "intro": "Allium pseudoglobosum, commonly known as the globe garlic. It is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, characterized by its compact, globe-shaped bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of the stem. It is closely related to other Allium species, such as garlic and onions, and shares similar botanical features. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and botanical collections."
