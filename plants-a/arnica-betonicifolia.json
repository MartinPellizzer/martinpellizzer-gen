    "intro": "Arnica betonicifolia, commonly known as the lesser arnica, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry meadows and rocky soils. The plant is often confused with other arnica species due to its similar appearance. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
