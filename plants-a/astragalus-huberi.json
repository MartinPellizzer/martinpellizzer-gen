    "intro": "Astragalus huberi, commonly known as the Huber milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Astragalus huberi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which release them when mature, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions."
