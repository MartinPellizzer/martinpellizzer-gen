    "intro": "Amalophyllon parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered amalophyllon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
