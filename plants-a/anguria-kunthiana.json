    "intro": "Anguria kunthiana, commonly known as the Mexican watermelon or wild watermelon, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, hairy stems, and large, lobed leaves. Its fruits are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature, though they are not as sweet as cultivated watermelons. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, sunny environments."
