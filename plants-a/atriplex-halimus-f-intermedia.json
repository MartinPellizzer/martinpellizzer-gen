    "intro": "Atriplex halimus f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh conditions."
