    "intro": "Athyrium acrostichoides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens."
