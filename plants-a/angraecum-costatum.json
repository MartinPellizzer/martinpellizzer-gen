    "intro": "Angraecum costatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems with clustered, white or pale pink flowers that have a distinctive star-like shape. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
