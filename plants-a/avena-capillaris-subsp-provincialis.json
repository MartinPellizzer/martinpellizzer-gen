    "intro": "Avena capillaris subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the provincial oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
