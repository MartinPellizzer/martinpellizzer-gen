    "intro": "Antidesma pulvinatum var. leiogonum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along riverbanks. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings for its dense foliage and adaptability."
