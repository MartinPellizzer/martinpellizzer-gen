    "intro": "Agrostis pumila var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms compact clumps with short, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
