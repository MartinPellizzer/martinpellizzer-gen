This variant of the plant is found specifically on the island of Pohnpei, which is part of the Caroline Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It grows in coastal areas and lowland forests, adapting to the tropical climate of the region. The plant is known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and is an important part of the local flora. Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic area, making it a unique species within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cardiophylla var. ponapensis was mainly introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. The distribution of this species is limited to specific islands within the region. It has not been found outside of these islands, indicating a restricted range. This introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
