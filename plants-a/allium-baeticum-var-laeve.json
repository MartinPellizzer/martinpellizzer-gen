    "intro": "Allium baeticum var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its aromatic, bulbous stems and grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, papery seed capsules. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in Mediterranean cuisine. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, unribbed leaves, which set it apart from other Allium species."
