    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia poilanei is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its unique characteristics, it is also sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia poilanei was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is commonly used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded environments. It has been introduced for purposes such as erosion control and as a source of fodder for livestock. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native regions."
