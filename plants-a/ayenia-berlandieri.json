    "intro": "Ayenia berlandieri, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds. Ayenia berlandieri plays a role in supporting local pollinators, although its toxic properties deter herbivores."
