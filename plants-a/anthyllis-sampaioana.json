    "intro": "Anthyllis sampaioana, commonly known as the Sampaio's anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or pale orange blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it often grows in well-drained soils in open habitats. Anthyllis sampaioana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
