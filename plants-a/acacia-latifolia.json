    "intro": "Acacia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky habitats. Acacia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia latifolia is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. Acacia latifolia is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution reflects its ability to thrive in the unique ecological conditions of northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia latifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It was also introduced for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. However, its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to it becoming an invasive species in some regions. Despite its benefits, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Proper management is necessary to control its spread and minimize ecological harm."
