    "intro": "Anemone cylindrica, commonly known as the cylinder anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a stout, unbranched stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a cylindrical shape that gives it its common name. Its leaves are deeply lobed and alternate along the stem, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Anemone cylindrica is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
