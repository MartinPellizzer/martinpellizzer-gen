    "intro": "Aristolochia macroglossa, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or brown in color. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as large moths. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is known for its complex chemical composition, including aristolochic acids, which have both medicinal and toxic properties."
