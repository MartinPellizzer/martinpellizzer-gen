    "intro": "Ajuga depressa, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga depressa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded gardens."
