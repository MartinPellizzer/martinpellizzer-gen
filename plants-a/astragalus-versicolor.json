    "intro": "Astragalus versicolor, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Astragalus versicolor is often found in the western United States and parts of Canada."
