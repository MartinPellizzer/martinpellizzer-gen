    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. gigantea, commonly known as giant silvergrass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green blades and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
