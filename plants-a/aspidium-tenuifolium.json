    "intro": "Aspidium tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. Aspidium tenuifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
