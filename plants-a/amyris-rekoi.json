    "intro": "Amyris rekoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Amyris rekoi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
