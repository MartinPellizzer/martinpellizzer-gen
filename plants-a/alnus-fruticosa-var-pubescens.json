    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent alder, is a shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near wetlands. This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in disturbed areas."
