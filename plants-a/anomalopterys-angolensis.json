    "intro": "Anomalopterys angolensis, commonly known as the Angola anomaly, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the humid forests of Angola. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure. The plant features compound leaves with elongated, pinnate lobes that give it a striking appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
