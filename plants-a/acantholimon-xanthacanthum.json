    "intro": "Acantholimon xanthacanthum, commonly known as the yellow-cup stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon xanthacanthum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at higher elevations. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon xanthacanthum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded habitats. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as landscaping and land development. It is considered a non-native species that can compete with native vegetation in certain environments."
