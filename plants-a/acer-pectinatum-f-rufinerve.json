    "intro": "Acer pectinatum f. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a vibrant green upper surface and a striking red or bronze underside that becomes more pronounced in autumn. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. The red-veined maple is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value.",
