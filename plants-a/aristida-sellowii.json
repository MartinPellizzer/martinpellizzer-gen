    "intro": "Aristida sellowii, commonly known as Sellow's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
