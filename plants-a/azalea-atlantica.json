    "intro": "Azalea atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It prefers partial to full sun and is often found in sandy or limestone soils along the Atlantic coast. Azalea atlantica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for various wildlife species."
