    "intro": "Allium modestum, commonly known as the common garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and flat, grass-like leaves that emit a mild garlic scent. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its bulbs are small and clustered, often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. Allium modestum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for gardens and landscapes."
