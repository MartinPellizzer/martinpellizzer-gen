    "intro": "Armatocereus rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's night bloomer, is a columnar cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It features a tall, slender stem with ribbed surfaces and spines that are typically white to yellow in color. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
