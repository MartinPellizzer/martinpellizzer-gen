    "intro": "Adiantum subvolubile, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble the wings of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and dying back after spore production.",
