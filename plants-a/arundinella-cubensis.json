    "intro": "Arundinella cubensis, commonly known as Cuban bamboo, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands in disturbed or wetland habitats. Arundinella cubensis is also valued for its lightweight and durable culms, which have been used traditionally in basket making and construction."
