It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in spines or thorns. The leaves are typically alternate and may be simple or lobed, depending on the species. Aporosa species produce small, often inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
