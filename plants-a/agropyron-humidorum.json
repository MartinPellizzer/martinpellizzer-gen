    "intro": "Agropyron humidorum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron humidorum is often found in disturbed soils and is used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in dryland environments."
