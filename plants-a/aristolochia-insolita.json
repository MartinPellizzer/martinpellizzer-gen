    "intro": "Aristolochia insolita, commonly known as the \"insolite arrowhead vine,\" is a climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and complex, pipe-like flowers that are often mistaken for orchids. The plant produces a strong, aromatic odor that attracts specific pollinators, such as flies. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a darker throat, and it is known for its rapid growth habit. However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
