    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus f. vriesii, commonly known as the hairy arthraxon, is a variant of the arthraxon plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lipped flowers, which are often pale green to reddish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
