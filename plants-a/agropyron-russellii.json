    "intro": "Agropyron russellii, commonly known as Russell's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is considered an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
