    "intro": "Argocoffeopsis rupestris subsp. thonneri, commonly known as the Thonner's rock coffee plant, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
