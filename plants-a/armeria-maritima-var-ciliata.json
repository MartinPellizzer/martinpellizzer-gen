    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. ciliata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
