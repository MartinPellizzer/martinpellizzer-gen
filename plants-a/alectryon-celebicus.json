    "intro": "Alectryon celebicus, commonly known as the Moluccan starfruit, is a species of flowering plant native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruit, which is typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are elliptical with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is edible, though it is not as widely cultivated as the common starfruit (Carambola), and is sometimes used in local cuisines for its tart flavor."
