    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoparalurges, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
