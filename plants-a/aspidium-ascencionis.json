    "intro": "Aspidium ascencionis, commonly known as the Ascension fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Aspidium ascencionis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal areas. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island biogeography."
