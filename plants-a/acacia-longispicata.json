    "intro": "Acacia longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender, spiny stipules that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are arranged in cylindrical or spicate inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. Acacia longispicata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.",

This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distinctive long, spiky pods are a notable feature of its appearance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longispicata was mainly introduced to India and the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is a shrub or small tree native to Australia and has been introduced for various purposes such as ornamental use or for soil stabilization. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for the regions where it has been introduced. In India, it has been found in areas with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. On the Lesser Sunda Islands, it has adapted to the local environmental conditions and has become part of the local flora."
