    "intro": "Acacia longifolia f. floribunda, commonly known as the coastal acacia or golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia f. floribunda is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, such as coastal dunes, sandy soils, and open woodlands. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its distribution is also influenced by its ability to grow in both full sun and partial shade conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia f. floribunda was mainly introduced to ornamental and landscaping purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. It has been widely planted in coastal and urban areas for its ability to thrive in saline and disturbed soils. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal capabilities contribute to its spread beyond cultivated areas. Management strategies are often required to control its impact on native flora and biodiversity."
