    "intro": "Arctagrostis humilis, commonly known as the eastern woodland grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. Arctagrostis humilis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
