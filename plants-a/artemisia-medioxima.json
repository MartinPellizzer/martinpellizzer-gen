    "intro": "Artemisia medioxima, commonly known as the Mexican wormwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of small, narrow leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia medioxima is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. It also contains essential oils that have been traditionally used in herbal remedies."
