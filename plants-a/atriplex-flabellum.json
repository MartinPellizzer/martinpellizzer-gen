    "intro": "Atriplex flabellum, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are succulent and often used as forage for livestock in desert environments. Atriplex flabellum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
