    "intro": "Aechmea rodriguesiana, commonly known as the Rodrigues pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears striking red and yellow flowers, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique structure and colorful blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
