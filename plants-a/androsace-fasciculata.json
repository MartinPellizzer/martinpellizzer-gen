    "intro": "Androsace fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments make it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation. Androsace fasciculata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate cold and poor soil conditions."
