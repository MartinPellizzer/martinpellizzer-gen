    "intro": "Arthrochilus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new shoot from the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
