    "intro": "Agrostis semiverticillata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 5 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are usually arranged in a compact, branched structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and dense growth, it is sometimes used in horticulture for ornamental purposes or as a component in turfgrass mixtures."
