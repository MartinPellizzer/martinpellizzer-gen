    "intro": "Angraecum pynaertii, commonly known as the Pynaert's star orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
