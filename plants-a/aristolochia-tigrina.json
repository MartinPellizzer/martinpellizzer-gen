    "intro": "Aristolochia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a tiger's face, giving it its common name. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are climbing and can reach significant lengths. The flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies and beetles."
