    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides subvar. typicus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. This species is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed areas, contributing to ecological diversity and soil stabilization."
