    "intro": "Androsace armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
