    "intro": "Antidesma tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
