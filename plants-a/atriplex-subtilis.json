    "intro": "Atriplex subtilis, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This shrub is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex subtilis is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions."
