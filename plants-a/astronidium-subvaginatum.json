    "intro": "Astronidium subvaginatum, commonly known as the narrow sheath starling tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaf sheaths and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite and often have a leathery texture, while the fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing several seeds. Astronidium subvaginatum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
