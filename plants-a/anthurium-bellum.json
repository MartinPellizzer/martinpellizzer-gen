    "intro": "Anthurium bellum, commonly known as the bell anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble a bell, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, surrounded by a colorful spathe. Anthurium bellum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
