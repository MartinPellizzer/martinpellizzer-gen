    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, often submerged or partially submerged in water. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically floating on the water surface or emerging from the water, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
