    "intro": "Ankyropetalum gypsophiloides var. viscosum, commonly known as the sticky gypsophiloid, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its sticky secretions on the foliage are a unique botanical feature that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
