This plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. It thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly associated with humid climates. The subspecies is known for its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata f. micrantha was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture for its attractive, fragrant flowers and compact growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes in temperate regions where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. This form is valued for its smaller, more delicate blooms compared to the typical species, making it a popular choice for borders and containers. It has been widely distributed across the United States and parts of Europe due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
