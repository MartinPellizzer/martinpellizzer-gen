    "intro": "Avenastrum alpinum, commonly known as alpine oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky soils and scree slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to harsh climates with strong winds and low temperatures, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems. Avenastrum alpinum plays a role in preventing soil erosion and provides habitat for various alpine invertebrates."
