    "intro": "Athamanta cretensis var. tenuior, commonly known as the Cretan spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
