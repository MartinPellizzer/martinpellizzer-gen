    "intro": "Aporosa lucida var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shining alder, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, typically appearing in early spring. Its fruit is a small, winged nutlet that aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest understories."
