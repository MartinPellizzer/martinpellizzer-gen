    "intro": "Aeschynomene glabrescens, commonly known as smallleaf stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen. Aeschynomene glabrescens is also valued for its role in soil conservation and erosion control in degraded lands."
