    "intro": "Astragalus bombycalyx var. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to soil stabilization. This variety is of interest in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen."
