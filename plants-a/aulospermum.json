    "intro": "Aulospermum, commonly known as plains coreopsis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Aulospermum species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. They have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and their flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. The genus includes several species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
