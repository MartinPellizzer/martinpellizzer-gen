    "intro": "Astragalus strictifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a robust root system adapted to drought conditions, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. The plant has compound leaves with stiff, narrow leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus strictifolius is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
