    "intro": "Aconitum degenii var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas accessible to children or pets.",
