    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. straminea, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more silvery as the plant matures. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
