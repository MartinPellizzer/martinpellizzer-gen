    "intro": "Alisma damasonium, commonly known as narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive sheath-like structure around the stem. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Alisma damasonium plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
