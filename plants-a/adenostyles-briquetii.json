    "intro": "Adenostyles briquetii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or open habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Adenostyles briquetii is adapted to thrive in regions with mild, wet winters and dry summers.",
