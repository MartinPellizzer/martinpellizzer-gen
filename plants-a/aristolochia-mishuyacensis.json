It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at moderate elevations, often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
