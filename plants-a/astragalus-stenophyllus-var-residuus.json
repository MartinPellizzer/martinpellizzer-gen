    "intro": "Astragalus stenophyllus var. residuus, commonly known as the residual narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its compound leaves consist of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
