    "intro": "Arosma obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage, which contains essential oils that contribute to its distinctive scent. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with stiff, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms in late summer with small, yellowish-green flower clusters, which are borne in terminal panicles. Arosma obtusifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
