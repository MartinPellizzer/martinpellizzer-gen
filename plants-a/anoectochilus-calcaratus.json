    "intro": "Anoectochilus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown spots. It has fibrous roots and is adapted to thrive in humid, misty conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
