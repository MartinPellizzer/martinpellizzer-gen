    "intro": "Anthyllis webbiana var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf anthyllis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
