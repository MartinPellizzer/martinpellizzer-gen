    "intro": "Acacia trigonophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Acacia trigonophylla is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trigonophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia trigonophylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trigonophylla was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and land rehabilitation efforts. It is commonly used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which enhance soil fertility in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Despite these concerns, it remains an important species in the restoration of native vegetation in the region."
