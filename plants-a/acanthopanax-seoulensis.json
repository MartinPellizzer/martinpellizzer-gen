    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax seoulensis is primarily native to South Korea, specifically the Seoul area. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central parts. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forest understory habitats. It is a climbing shrub that can be found in various forested areas throughout its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in South Korea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax seoulensis was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in South Korea, particularly in regions with moderate climates. It is commonly found along roadsides, in parks, and near residential areas due to its adaptability to disturbed soils and limited maintenance requirements. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used for erosion control and ornamental purposes. Its introduction has been associated with efforts to enhance green spaces and improve urban aesthetics. However, it has also raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain local ecosystems."
