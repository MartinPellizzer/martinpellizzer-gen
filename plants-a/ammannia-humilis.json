    "intro": "Ammannia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ammannia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers, which are borne on short, erect inflorescences. Ammannia humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
