It is well adapted to harsh, saline environments and is often found in coastal tundra and saline soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. It produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex alaskensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
