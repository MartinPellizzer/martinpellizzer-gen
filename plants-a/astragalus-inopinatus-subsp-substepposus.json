    "intro": "Astragalus inopinatus subsp. substepposus, commonly known as the steppe milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
