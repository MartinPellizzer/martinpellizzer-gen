    "intro": "Aspidium alsophilaceum, commonly known as the coastal wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. The plant's botanical features make it an important indicator species for certain habitats."
