    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. barbata, commonly known as the sticky alder or barbate alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that release a resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. This species is often found in moist, acidic soils and is known for its role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
