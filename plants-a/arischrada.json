It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are often pink or purple and attract various pollinators. Arischrada is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
