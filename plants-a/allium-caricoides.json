    "intro": "Allium caricoides, commonly known as the broadleaf garlic or the marsh garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem that bears small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a umbel. Its bulbs, which are edible, are often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than other Allium species. Allium caricoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or riparian habitats."
