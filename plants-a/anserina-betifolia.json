    "intro": "Anserina betifolia, commonly known as the water beetroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Anserina betifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is adapted to environments with standing water."
