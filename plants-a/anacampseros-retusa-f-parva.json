It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
