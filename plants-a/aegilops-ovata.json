    "intro": "Aegilops ovata, commonly known as the slender wild emmer, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish spikelets. Aegilops ovata is closely related to wheat and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its genetic diversity. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
