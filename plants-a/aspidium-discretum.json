It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette or clustered form. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium discretum is a small, cryptogamic plant with a simple yet distinctive botanical structure."
