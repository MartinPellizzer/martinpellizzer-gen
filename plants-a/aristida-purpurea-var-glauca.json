    "intro": "Aristida purpurea var. glauca, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-gray hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
