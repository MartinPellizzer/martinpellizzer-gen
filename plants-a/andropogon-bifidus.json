    "intro": "Andropogon bifidus, commonly known as the eastern gamagrass, is a tall grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and panicle-like inflorescence composed of multiple spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Andropogon bifidus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
