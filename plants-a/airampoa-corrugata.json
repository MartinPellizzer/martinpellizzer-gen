    "intro": "Airampoa corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, corrugated leaf surfaces and tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
