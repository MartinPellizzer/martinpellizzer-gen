    "intro": "Achlys triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its three-lobed leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.",
