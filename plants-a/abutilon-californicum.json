    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon californicum is primarily native to the Mexican Pacific Is., Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Northwest. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions within these regions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen along the coastline. The species is well adapted to the mild, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It is an important part of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon californicum was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal regions. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. Its ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction has contributed to its widespread distribution. However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has become naturalized."
