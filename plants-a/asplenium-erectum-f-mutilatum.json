    "intro": "Asplenium erectum f. mutilatum, commonly known as the fragmented spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its reduced, often fragmented fronds that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical form of *Asplenium erectum*. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its foliage is usually dark green and possesses a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its unique morphology in horticultural collections."
