    "intro": "Adiantum feei, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, slender pinnae that are often curved downward. Adiantum feei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
