    "intro": "Arenaria neelgherrensis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the Neelgherrensis sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a compact growth habit with a mat-like structure, often forming dense carpets on rocky or gravelly slopes. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to harsh mountain environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
