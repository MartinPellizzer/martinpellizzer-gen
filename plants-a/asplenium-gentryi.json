    "intro": "Asplenium gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with high humidity and rich soil. Asplenium gentryi is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
