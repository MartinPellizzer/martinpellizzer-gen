    "intro": "Areca borbonica, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of bright red fruits that contain a single seed, which is the source of the betel nut. The leaves are often used in traditional practices, while the seeds are cultivated for their economic value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
