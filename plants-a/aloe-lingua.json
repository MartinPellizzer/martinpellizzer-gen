    "intro": "Aloe lingua, commonly known as the tongue aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and narrow, fang-like leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically a bluish-green color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
