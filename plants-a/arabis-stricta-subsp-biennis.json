    "intro": "Arabis stricta subsp. biennis, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Arabis stricta subsp. biennis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
