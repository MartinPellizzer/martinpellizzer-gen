It belongs to the genus Schlumbergera and is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant blooms during the holiday season, typically in late autumn to winter. Alicastrum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its long-lasting flowers and ease of care."
