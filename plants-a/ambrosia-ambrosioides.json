    "intro": "Ambrosia ambrosioides, commonly known as wormseed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces tiny, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Ambrosia ambrosioides is known for its irritant properties, particularly affecting the respiratory system in some individuals."
