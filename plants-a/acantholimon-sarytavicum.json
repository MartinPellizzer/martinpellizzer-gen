    "intro": "Acantholimon sarytavicum, commonly known as the Sarytav Valley thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant features spiny leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers in late spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon sarytavicum is primarily native to Kirgizstan. This plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the alpine and subalpine zones. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. The species is adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local flora and is often found in meadows and slopes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon sarytavicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-gray foliage and delicate flowers. It has since been found growing in various habitats, including rocky slopes and disturbed soils. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it requires specific growing conditions and is not commonly cultivated outside of controlled environments. Its distribution remains limited, primarily confined to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions."
