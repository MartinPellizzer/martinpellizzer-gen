    "intro": "Avellanita bustillosii, commonly known as the Mexican hazelnut, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, nut-like fruits enclosed in a husk. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a distinctive, aromatic bark. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
