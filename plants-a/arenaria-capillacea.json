    "intro": "Arenaria capillacea, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal dunes, sandy soils, and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing sandy environments."
