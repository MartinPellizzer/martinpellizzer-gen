    "intro": "Abies forrestii var. ferreana, commonly known as the red spruce, is a variant of the spruce genus native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The leaves are typically short, stiff, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. Its cones are usually pendulous and mature to a reddish color, contributing to its ornamental value. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

This variant of the fir tree is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist climates. The plant is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. ferreana was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in North America for its ornamental value. It is prized for its compact size, dense foliage, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often used as a decorative evergreen in gardens and along pathways. Its introduction has expanded its geographic range beyond its native habitat in China. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
