It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and waxy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Adenia angustisepala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid conditions.",
