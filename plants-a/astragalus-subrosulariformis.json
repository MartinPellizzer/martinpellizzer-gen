    "intro": "Astragalus subrosulariformis, commonly known as the Rosulariform Astragalus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
