    "intro": "Anthemis arvensis subsp. glabra, commonly known as field chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with linear leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is often attributed to its essential oils. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
