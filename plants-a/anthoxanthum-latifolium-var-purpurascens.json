    "intro": "Anthoxanthum latifolium var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Anthoxanthum. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in open woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
