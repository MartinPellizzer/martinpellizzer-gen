    "intro": "Aegilops virescens, commonly known as green false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Aegilops virescens is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat breeding programs."
