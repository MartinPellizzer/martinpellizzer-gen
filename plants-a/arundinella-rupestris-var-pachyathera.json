    "intro": "Arundinella rupestris var. pachyathera, commonly known as the thick-leaved bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its robust, thick, and fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
