    "intro": "Astragalus unifoliolatus, commonly known as the single leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and a single, trifoliate leaflet at the base of each stem. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus unifoliolatus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
