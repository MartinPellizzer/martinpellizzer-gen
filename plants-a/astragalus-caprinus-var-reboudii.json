    "intro": "Astragalus caprinus var. reboudii, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Astragalus caprinus."
