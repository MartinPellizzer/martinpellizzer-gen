    "intro": "Aster elongatus var. pappei, commonly known as the Pappe's elongated aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in the late summer and early autumn, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a desirable addition to native plant collections."
