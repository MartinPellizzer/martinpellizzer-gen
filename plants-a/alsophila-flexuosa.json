    "intro": "Alsophila flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a thick, fibrous mass, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a smooth, glossy surface and a pale green color. Alsophila flexuosa is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
