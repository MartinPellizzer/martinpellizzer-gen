It is characterized by its palmate leaves that typically have five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",
