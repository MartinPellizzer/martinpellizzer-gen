    "intro": "Acantholimon acerosum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink to purplish flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is often found in coastal and inland desert environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.",

This plant is found in specific regions within Turkey, particularly in the eastern and central parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates typical of these regions. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Turkey's diverse landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon acerosum var. parvifolium was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous or coastal regions. It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is typically associated with Mediterranean climates but has been introduced to other regions with similar conditions. It is known for its low-growing habit and small, narrow leaves. Due to its hardiness, it has become a common ornamental plant in some areas outside its native range."
