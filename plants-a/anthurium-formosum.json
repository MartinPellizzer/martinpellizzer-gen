    "intro": "Anthurium formosum, commonly known as the Red Velvet Anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range from deep red to maroon, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its foliage consists of dark green, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. Anthurium formosum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
