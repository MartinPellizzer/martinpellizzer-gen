    "intro": "Angorkis criptangis, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that resemble those of a true fern. The plant thrives in high humidity and low light conditions, often growing on the trunks of ancient trees or on rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically hidden beneath the fronds, contributing to its cryptic name. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Angorkis criptangis is considered a vulnerable species."
