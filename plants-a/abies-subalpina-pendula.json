    "intro": "Abies subalpina pendula, commonly known as the weeping subalpine fir, is a rare and distinctive conifer native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, and it produces small, cone-like structures that mature to release seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies subalpina pendula is primarily native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and Korea. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in coniferous forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species is commonly associated with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species such as fir and spruce. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and has a limited geographic distribution.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies subalpina pendula was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with high elevation and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species such as fir and spruce. Its introduction has been observed in regions where its native range extends, including parts of Europe and Asia. However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and climate constraints."
