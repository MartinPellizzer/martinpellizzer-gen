    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. bisulca, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense mat of hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, typically clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it its common name and aid in insulation against cold temperatures. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions."
