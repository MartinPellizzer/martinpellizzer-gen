It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and may have traditional uses in local medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
