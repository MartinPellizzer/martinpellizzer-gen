    "intro": "Aspidium subrepandum, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular to ovate fronds that are often divided into segments resembling a buckler or shield. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a thin, protective layer. Aspidium subrepandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
