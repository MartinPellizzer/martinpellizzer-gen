    "intro": "Asclepias alba, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals. Asclepias alba plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a source of nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
