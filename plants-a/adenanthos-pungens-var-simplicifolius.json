    "intro": "Adenanthos pungens var. simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved adenanthos, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its unique foliage and compact growth habit make it a desirable plant for native gardens.",
