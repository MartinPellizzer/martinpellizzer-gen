    "intro": "Athyrium confertum, commonly known as the dense fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that often grow in a compact, bushy form. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or forest understories, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Athyrium confertum is valued for its aesthetic qualities and is often used in garden settings where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions."
