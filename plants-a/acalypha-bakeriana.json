    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha bakeriana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha bakeriana was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the islands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems."
