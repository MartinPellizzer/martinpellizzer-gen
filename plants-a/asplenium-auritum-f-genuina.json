    "intro": "Asplenium auritum f. genuina, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the margins of its dark green, lanceolate leaves. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant is relatively small, with a compact growth habit, making it a suitable specimen for rock gardens or terrariums."
