    "intro": "Anisophyllum polycnemoides, commonly known as the common spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, succulent stems and alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers known as cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Anisophyllum polycnemoides is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic to livestock and humans."
