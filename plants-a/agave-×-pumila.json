    "intro": "Agave \u00d7 pumila, commonly known as the miniature agave or dwarf agave, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Agave americana and Agave rhodacantha. It is a succulent perennial with a rosette growth habit, characterized by thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
