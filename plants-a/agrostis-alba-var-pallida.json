    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. pallida, commonly known as the pale meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, pale green to silver-white spikelets that are characteristic of the species. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-gray hue that distinguishes it from other similar grasses. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
