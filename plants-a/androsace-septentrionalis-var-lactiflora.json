It features a dense mat of fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
