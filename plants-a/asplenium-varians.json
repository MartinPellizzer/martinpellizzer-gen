    "intro": "Asplenium varians, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller lobes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium varians is often found on rocks or in crevices, thriving in humid, temperate climates."
