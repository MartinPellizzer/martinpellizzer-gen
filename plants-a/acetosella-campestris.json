    "intro": "Acetosella campestris, commonly known as common sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant contains oxalic acid, which gives it a sharp, sour taste and makes it potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Acetosella campestris is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",
