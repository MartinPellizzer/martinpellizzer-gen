    "intro": "Agrostis verticillata var. acutiglumis, commonly known as the acuteawn bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually hairless or sparingly hairy, with a distinctive acute awn at the base of each lemma. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting diverse invertebrate life."
