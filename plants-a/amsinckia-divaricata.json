    "intro": "Amsinckia divaricata, commonly known as the desert tarplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Amsinckia divaricata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
