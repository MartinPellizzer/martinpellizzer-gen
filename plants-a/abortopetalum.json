    "intro": "Abortopetalum, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which resemble a bottlebrush due to their dense, red or yellow bracts. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture. These plants are native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
