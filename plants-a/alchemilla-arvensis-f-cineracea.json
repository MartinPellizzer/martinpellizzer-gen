It is characterized by its rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that give it a dusty appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
