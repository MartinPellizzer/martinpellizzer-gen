    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis var. sonomensis, commonly known as the Sonoma hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
