    "intro": "Acidonia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and waxy, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a foundation plant in landscapes.",
