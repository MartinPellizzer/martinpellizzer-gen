    "intro": "Arthraxon lancifolius var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The leaves are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, hence the varietal name \"microphyllus.\" It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. This plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies."
