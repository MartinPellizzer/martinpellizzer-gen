The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical or subtropical climates and is often found in humid lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
