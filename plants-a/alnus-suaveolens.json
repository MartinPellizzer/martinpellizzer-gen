    "intro": "Alnus suaveolens, commonly known as sweet-scented alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important early food source for pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas. Alnus suaveolens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
