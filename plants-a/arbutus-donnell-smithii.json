    "intro": "Arbutus donnell-smithii, commonly known as the San Francisco creek madrone, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of northern California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are favored by birds and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
