    "intro": "Astragalus brachyrhachis, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale purple to yellow and bloom in late spring or early summer. Astragalus brachyrhachis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
