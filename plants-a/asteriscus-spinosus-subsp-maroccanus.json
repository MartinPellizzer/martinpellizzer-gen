    "intro": "Asteriscus spinosus subsp. maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan thorned aster, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. The plant has spiny stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
