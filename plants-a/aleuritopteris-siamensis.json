    "intro": "Aleuritopteris siamensis, commonly known as the Siam water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a delicate, translucent appearance. Aleuritopteris siamensis is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
