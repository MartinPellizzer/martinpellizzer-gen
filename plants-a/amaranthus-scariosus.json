    "intro": "Amaranthus scariosus, commonly known as the scarious amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from green to red, depending on the stage of development. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Amaranthus scariosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
