    "intro": "Andinia sunchubambensis, commonly known as the Sunchubamba orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in the cool, humid microclimates of its native habitat. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
