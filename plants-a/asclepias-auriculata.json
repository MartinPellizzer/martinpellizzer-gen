    "intro": "Asclepias auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a food source for their larvae. Asclepias auriculata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry, open habitats."
