    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus var. junnarensis, commonly known as the Junnare grass, is a perennial herb native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
