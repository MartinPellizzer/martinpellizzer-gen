    "intro": "Astragalus schanginianus, commonly known as Schangin's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and China. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense heads, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
