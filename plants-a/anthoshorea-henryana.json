    "intro": "Anthoshorea henryana, commonly known as the Henry's anthoshorea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
