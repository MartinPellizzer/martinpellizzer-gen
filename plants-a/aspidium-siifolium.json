    "intro": "Aspidium siifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium siifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
