    "intro": "Acalypha leicesterfieldiensis, commonly known as the Leicesterfield's spurge, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It is commonly observed in moist, shaded areas within the island's forests. The plant is adapted to the humid climate and fertile soils of Jamaica. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha leicesterfieldiensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since been found in various parts of the country, particularly in the North Island. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has been limited by its preference for disturbed soils and open habitats. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further encroachment into native ecosystems."
