    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf white fir, is a compact variant of the white fir species. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This evergreen conifer has a conical shape with short, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. Its small size makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh mountain conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pygmaea is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the western Himalayas, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This variety is typically found in alpine environments at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or forested areas. The plant is adapted to harsh mountain conditions and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pygmaea was mainly introduced to specific regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, often in high-altitude or mountainous areas. It is typically found in habitats that mimic its native environment, such as forests with a mix of coniferous and broadleaf trees. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal, including its compact size and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of Europe and North America for landscaping and horticultural purposes. However, its introduction is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and sensitivity to environmental changes."
