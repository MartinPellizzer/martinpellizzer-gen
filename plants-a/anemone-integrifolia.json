    "intro": "Anemone integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a central cluster of yellow stamens, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Anemone integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
