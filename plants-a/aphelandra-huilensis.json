It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
