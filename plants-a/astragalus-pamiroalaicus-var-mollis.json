    "intro": "Astragalus pamiroalaicus var. mollis, commonly known as the Pamir milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
