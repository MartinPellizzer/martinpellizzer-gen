    "intro": "Arum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Ethiopia. It features a large, heart-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces an ornamental spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage. Due to its unique appearance, it is popular in tropical and subtropical gardens."
