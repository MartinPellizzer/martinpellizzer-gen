    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered maple, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple characterized by its finely textured, almost powdery leaves. The foliage exhibits a delicate, velvety appearance due to the dense layer of fine hairs on the leaf surfaces. It typically displays a range of colors from pale green to red and crimson, depending on the season and environmental conditions. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit and is well-suited for smaller gardens or container planting. Its unique leaf texture and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.",
