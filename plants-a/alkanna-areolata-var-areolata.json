    "intro": "Alkanna areolata var. areolata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
