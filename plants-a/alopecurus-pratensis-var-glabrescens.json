    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
