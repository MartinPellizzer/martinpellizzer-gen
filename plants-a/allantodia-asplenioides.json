    "intro": "Allantodia asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Allantodia asplenioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
