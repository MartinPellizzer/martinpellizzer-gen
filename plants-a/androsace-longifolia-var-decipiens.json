    "intro": "Androsace longifolia var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive longstem sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of hairy, prostrate stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pink. The plant's leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a woolly texture that helps insulate it from cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its compact growth and attractive flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
