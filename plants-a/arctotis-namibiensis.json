It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces showy, daisy-like blooms in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
