    "intro": "Abrodictyum setaceum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Abrodictyum setaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum setaceum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. Abrodictyum setaceum is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum setaceum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and open fields. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with wetland or riparian habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native species in many parts of its range."
