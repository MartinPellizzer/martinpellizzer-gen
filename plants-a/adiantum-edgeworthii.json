    "intro": "Adiantum edgeworthii, commonly known as the edgeworth's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Adiantum edgeworthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
