It is characterized by its unique, violet-colored flowers that resemble tiny amethyst crystals, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its blooming period typically occurs during the winter months, adding a rare beauty to the landscape. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
