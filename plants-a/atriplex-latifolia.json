    "intro": "Atriplex latifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant has a system of deep roots that allow it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Atriplex latifolia is often found in saline soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion."
