    "intro": "Anisopappus robynsianus, commonly known as Robyn's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Anisopappus robynsianus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
