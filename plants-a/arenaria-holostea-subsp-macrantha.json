    "intro": "Arenaria holostea subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, prostrate stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
