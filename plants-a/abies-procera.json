    "intro": "Abies procera, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are long, flat, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the tree its common name. It produces cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies procera is primarily native to California, Oregon, and Washington. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these states, particularly in the coastal and inland mountain ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist climates at higher elevations. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is well adapted to the rugged terrain of the Pacific Northwest. The tree is known for its tall, slender form and is an important component of the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies procera was mainly introduced to Denmark, F\u00f8royar, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. It is a species of fir tree native to North America, specifically the western United States and Canada. The introduction of Abies procera to these regions is likely due to ornamental horticulture or reforestation efforts. It has been documented growing in various habitats, including mountainous areas and disturbed sites. However, its establishment and spread in these regions remain limited compared to its native range."
