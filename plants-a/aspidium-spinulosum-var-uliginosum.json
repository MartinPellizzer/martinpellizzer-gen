    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. uliginosum, commonly known as the bog aspidium, is a fern native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are covered in small, spiny structures called spinules, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain the spores necessary for reproduction. This variety is adapted to low-light conditions and plays an important ecological role in its wetland habitat."
