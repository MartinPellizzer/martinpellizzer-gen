    "intro": "Alternanthera galapagensis, commonly known as the Galapagos Alternanthera, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under direct sunlight. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
