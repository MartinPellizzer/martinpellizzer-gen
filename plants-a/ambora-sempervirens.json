    "intro": "Ambora sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen fern, is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that remain green throughout the year. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps over time. Its leaves are typically bipinnately divided, creating a feathery appearance that adds texture to the landscape. Ambora sempervirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in damp conditions."
