It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow or reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
