    "intro": "Adiantopsis asplenioides, commonly known as the small water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Adiantopsis asplenioides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.",
