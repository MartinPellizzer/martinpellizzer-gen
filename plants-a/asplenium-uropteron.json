    "intro": "Asplenium uropteron, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of spleenwort belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, velvety fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium uropteron is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
