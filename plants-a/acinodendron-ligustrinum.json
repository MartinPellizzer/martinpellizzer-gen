    "intro": "Acinodendron ligustrinum, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The plant has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Acinodendron ligustrinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.",
