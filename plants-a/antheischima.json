    "intro": "Antheischima, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that resemble miniature torches. The plant's flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a strong, spicy scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antheischima thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and traditional use in cultural ceremonies."
