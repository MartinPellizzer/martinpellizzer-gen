    "intro": "Anisocarpus yosemitanus, commonly known as Yosemitan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces unique, one-sided fruits called anisocarps, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
