It features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are hairy and upright. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.
