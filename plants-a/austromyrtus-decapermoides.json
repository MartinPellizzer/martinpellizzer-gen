    "intro": "Austromyrtus decapermoides, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Austromyrtus decapermoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
