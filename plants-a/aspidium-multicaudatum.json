    "intro": "Aspidium multicaudatum, commonly known as the many-tailed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a water lily. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium multicaudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
