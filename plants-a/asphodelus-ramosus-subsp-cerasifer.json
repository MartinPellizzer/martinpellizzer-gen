It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the development of fleshy, red or purple berries that mature in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid habitats."
