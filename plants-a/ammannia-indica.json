It features erect, branched stems that are often reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ammannia indica is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
