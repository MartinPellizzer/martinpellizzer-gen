    "intro": "Asplenium perkinsii, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium perkinsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
