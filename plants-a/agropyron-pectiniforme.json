    "intro": "Agropyron pectiniforme, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive seed heads that resemble small brushes or combs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agropyron pectiniforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
