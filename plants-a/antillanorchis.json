    "intro": "Antillanorchis, commonly known as the Antillean orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant blooms. The plants typically have slender stems and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Antillanorchis species are known for their small, colorful flowers that often resemble those of other orchid genera. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, many species within this genus are considered endangered."
