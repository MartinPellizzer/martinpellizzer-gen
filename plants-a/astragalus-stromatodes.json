    "intro": "Astragalus stromatodes, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
