    "intro": "Angraecoides zaratananae, commonly known as the Zaratanana orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the humid understory. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, with long nectar spurs that match the proboscis of specific nocturnal species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
