    "intro": "Asclepias volubilis, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender stems that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant produces showy, orange-to-red flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, which attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias volubilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
