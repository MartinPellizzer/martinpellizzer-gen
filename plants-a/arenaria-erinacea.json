    "intro": "Arenaria erinacea, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. It typically grows in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Arenaria erinacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme environments and is an important component of the local flora."
