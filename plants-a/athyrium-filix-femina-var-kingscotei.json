    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. kingscotei, commonly known as the Kingscote lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
