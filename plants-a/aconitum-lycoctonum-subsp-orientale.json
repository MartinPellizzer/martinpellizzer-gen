    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. orientale, commonly known as the Eastern monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with prominent yellow spurs. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
