    "intro": "Artemisia indica var. dissecta, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features silvery-gray, aromatic foliage with finely dissected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
