    "intro": "Amarella arctophila, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Amarella arctophila plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems."
