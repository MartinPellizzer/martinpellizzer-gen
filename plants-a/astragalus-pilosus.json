    "intro": "Astragalus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus pilosus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
