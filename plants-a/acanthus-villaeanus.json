    "intro": "Acanthus villaeanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, spire-like inflorescences with purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Acanthus villaeanus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun. It is also a popular choice for garden design due to its architectural form and long-lasting foliage.",

The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within DR Congo due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus villaeanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and floral display. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through its extensive root system. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
