    "intro": "Agrostis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bent, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, spreading stems with wide, flat leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in turfgrass mixes."
