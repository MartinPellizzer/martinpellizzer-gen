    "intro": "Anthurium subulatum, commonly known as the needle anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium subulatum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and long-lasting blooms."
