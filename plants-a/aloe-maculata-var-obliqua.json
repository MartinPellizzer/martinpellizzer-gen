It features upright, branching stems covered in fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are adorned with distinctive, narrow, longitudinal stripes that give the plant its characteristic appearance. It produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. This hardy plant is well-suited for arid climates and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
