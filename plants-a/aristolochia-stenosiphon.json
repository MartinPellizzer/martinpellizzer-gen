    "intro": "Aristolochia stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant's unique floral structure, with a complex spathaceous sheath, is characteristic of the Aristolochiaceae family. It contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic compounds that have been linked to severe health effects in humans. Despite its medicinal uses in traditional practices, it is considered a potent toxin and is not recommended for use without professional guidance."
