    "intro": "Astragalus pastellianus, commonly known as the pastel milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. Astragalus pastellianus is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
