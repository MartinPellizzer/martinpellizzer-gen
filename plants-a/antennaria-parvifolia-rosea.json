    "intro": "Antennaria parvifolia rosea, commonly known as the roseless mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antennaria parvifolia rosea is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in cool, moist environments."
