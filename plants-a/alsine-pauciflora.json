    "intro": "Alsine pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its short stature and succulent leaves help it conserve water efficiently. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native habitat."
