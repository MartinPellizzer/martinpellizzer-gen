    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. argenteomarginatum, commonly known as the silver-margin maple, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple known for its striking foliage. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a vibrant green upper surface and a distinctive silvery-white margin that stands out against the green. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. Its unique leaf coloration makes it a favorite among horticulturists and landscape designers.",
