    "intro": "Aspidium sieberianum, commonly known as the Sieber's water fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium sieberianum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
