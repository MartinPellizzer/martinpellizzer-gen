    "intro": "Agrostis navarroi, commonly known as Navarro's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form dense mats."
