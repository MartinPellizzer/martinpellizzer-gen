    "intro": "Adenocrepis tetrandra, commonly known as the four-threaded sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Adenocrepis tetrandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.",
