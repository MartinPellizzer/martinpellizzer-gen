    "intro": "Avicularia maritima, commonly known as the sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in coastal waters. It has a distinctive cylindrical body with a central oral disc surrounded by tentacles. The tentacles are equipped with nematocysts, specialized cells used for capturing prey and defense. It typically inhabits sandy or muddy substrates near the shoreline. Avicularia maritima plays a role in marine ecosystems by serving as both predator and prey."
