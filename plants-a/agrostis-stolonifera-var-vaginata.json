    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. vaginata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense turf that is both drought-tolerant and low-maintenance."
