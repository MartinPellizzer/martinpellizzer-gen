    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia praecox f. inermis is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions in New South Wales and Queensland. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in woodland and open forest habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The species is often seen in coastal and inland areas where it forms part of the native vegetation. Its distribution is largely restricted to the subtropical and temperate zones of eastern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia praecox f. inermis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and drought tolerance. It is commonly found in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. However, it has been noted to spread aggressively and may become invasive in certain regions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on native plant communities."
