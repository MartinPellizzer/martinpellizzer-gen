    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon fuscicalyx is primarily native to Bolivia. It is commonly found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the Amazonian lowlands. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats. Its native range is limited to specific areas within Bolivia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fuscicalyx was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to maintain its vibrant appearance. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes where it can provide both aesthetic and ecological benefits."
