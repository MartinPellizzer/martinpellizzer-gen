    "intro": "Andrachne minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Andrachne minutifolia is typically found in disturbed soils and is a common component of desert ecosystems."
