It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white fuzz. It is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. This variety is native to the Pacific coast of North America and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
