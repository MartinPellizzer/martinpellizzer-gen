    "intro": "Aster diffusus var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender stems that spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in garden settings. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade."
