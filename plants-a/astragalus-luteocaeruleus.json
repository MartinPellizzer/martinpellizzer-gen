    "intro": "Astragalus luteocaeruleus, commonly known as the yellow-blue milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish to blue flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and harsh climates. Astragalus luteocaeruleus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
