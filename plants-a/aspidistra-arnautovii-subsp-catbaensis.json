    "intro": "Aspidistra arnautovii subsp. catbaensis, commonly known as the Catbaensis arrowhead, is a rare evergreen perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dark green, glossy, and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers with three petals and three sepals, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
