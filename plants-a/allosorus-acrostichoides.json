It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive, elongated shape. Allosorus acrostichoides reproduces through spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
