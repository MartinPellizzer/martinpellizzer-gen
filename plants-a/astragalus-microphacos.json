    "intro": "Astragalus microphacos, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hard pods containing several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus microphacos plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
