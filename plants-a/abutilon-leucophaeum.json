    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon leucophaeum is primarily native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It is found in the coastal areas and lowland forests of the island. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or along forest edges. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon leucophaeum was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the ecosystem. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where it has established itself."
