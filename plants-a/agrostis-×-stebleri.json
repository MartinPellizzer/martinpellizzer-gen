    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 stebleri, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in grass species."
