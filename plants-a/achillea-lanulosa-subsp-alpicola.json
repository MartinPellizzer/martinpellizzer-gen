    "intro": "Achillea lanulosa subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and poor conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in mountainous environments. The subspecies alpicola is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flower heads compared to other members of the species.",
