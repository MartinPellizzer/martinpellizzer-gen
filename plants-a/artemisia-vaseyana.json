    "intro": "Artemisia vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia vaseyana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally toxic in large quantities."
