    "intro": "Aquilegia alpina subsp. sternebergii, commonly known as the Alpine columbine, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in mountainous habitats at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
