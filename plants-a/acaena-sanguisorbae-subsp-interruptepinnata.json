    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. interruptepinnata, commonly known as the red burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive red, bristly fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a persistent, spiny capsule. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge. The species is part of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental features and ecological role in native habitats.",

This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forest margins, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the North Island and parts of the South Island. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. interruptepinnata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. This subspecies is now considered a weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in native habitats. Its introduction has had ecological impacts, affecting native plant communities and soil stability."
