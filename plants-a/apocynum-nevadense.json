    "intro": "Apocynum nevadense, commonly known as the Nevadans milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
