    "intro": "Acrostichum subdiaphanum, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are usually light green and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in lowland rainforests.",
