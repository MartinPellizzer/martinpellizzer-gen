It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features striking blue-purple flowers arranged in a hooded shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Like other aconites, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it both a hazardous and ecologically significant plant.",
