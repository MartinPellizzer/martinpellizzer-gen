    "intro": "Anacyclus pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spherical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with the leaves forming a dense mat. Anacyclus pectinatus is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value due to its unique appearance."
