    "intro": "Asparagus verticillatus subsp. floribundus, commonly known as the clustered asparagus, is a shrub-like plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to various light conditions, making it a versatile ornamental plant."
