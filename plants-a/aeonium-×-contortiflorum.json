    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 contortiflorum, commonly known as the twisted-flower aeonium, is a hybrid succulent native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that range from blue-green to gray-green in color. The plant produces striking, spiral-like inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
