    "intro": "Aconitum alienum, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum alienum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.",
