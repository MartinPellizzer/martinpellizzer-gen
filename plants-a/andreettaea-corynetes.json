    "intro": "Andreettaea corynetes, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Brazilian conservation laws."
