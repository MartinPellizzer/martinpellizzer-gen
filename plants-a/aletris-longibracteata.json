    "intro": "Aletris longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract aletris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has grass-like, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Aletris longibracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
