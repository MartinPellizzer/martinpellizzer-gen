    "intro": "Aspidium nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that resemble a kidney shape, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sporocarps that are often clustered together. Aspidium nephrodioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
