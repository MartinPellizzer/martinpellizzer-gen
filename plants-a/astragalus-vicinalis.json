It typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are compound with multiple leaflets. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal climates. Astragalus vicinalis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations."
