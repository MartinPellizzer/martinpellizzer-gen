    "intro": "Astragalus rzaevii, commonly known as the Rzaev's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves, which are typical features of many Astragalus species. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers that are clustered in racemes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Native to specific regions in the Balkans, it thrives in rocky and dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
