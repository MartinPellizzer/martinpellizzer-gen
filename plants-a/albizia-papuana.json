    "intro": "Albizia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan siris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and pod fruits. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Albizia papuana produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
