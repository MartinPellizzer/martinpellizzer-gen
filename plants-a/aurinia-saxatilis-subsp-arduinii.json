It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas where it thrives in harsh, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces silique-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
