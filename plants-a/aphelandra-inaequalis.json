    "intro": "Aphelandra inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal flame plant, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae) and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a glossy green surface and a distinctive reddish or bronze-colored underside. The plant produces vibrant orange to red spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the tiny, clustered flowers. Aphelandra inaequalis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering display."
