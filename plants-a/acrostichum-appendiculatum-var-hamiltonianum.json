    "intro": "Acrostichum appendiculatum var. hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its long, linear fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, tropical gardens.",
