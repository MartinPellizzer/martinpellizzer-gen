    "intro": "Asplenium sancti-christofori, commonly known as the Saint Christopher's spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin. It produces spores in tiny, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
