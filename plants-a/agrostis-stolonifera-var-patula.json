    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. patula, commonly known as mat grass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, low-growing turf through the spread of stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping and erosion control. Its adaptability and resilience make it a valuable species in various ecological and agricultural contexts."
