    "intro": "Aerva radicans, commonly known as the spreading euphorbia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with erect, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on cyathia typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Aerva radicans is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
