    "intro": "Aconitum chiachaense, commonly known as the Chiapas aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aconitum chiachaense contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
