It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The subspecies f. leiocarpus is distinguished by its smooth, hairless pods and smaller, more rounded seeds compared to other forms of Astragalus haydenianus."
