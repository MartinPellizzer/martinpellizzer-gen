    "intro": "Arenaria scabra, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
