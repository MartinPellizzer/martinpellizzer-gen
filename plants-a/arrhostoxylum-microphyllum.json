    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spine-tipped tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in dry environments. Arrhostoxylum microphyllum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
