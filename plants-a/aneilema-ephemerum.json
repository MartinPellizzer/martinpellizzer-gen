    "intro": "Aneilema ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral aneilema, is a rare and short-lived plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom briefly before the plant dies. The species is known for its rapid life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a few months. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and short lifespan, Aneilema ephemerum is considered a botanical curiosity and is rarely cultivated outside its native range."
