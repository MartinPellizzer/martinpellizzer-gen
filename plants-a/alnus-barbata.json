    "intro": "Alnus barbata, commonly known as the barbed alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 10 pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. Alnus barbata has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands."
