It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique seed pod that splits open to release its seeds with a silky appendage, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient and ecologically important plant."
