It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Alsine polygonoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
