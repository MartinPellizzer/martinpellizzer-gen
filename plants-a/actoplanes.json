    "intro": "Actoplanes, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a type of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is a multicellular organism that forms dense, sheet-like structures on rocky shores and in shallow coastal waters. Actoplanes thrives in marine environments and is often found in tide pools and estuaries. The plant has a simple structure with a flat thallus that is rich in chlorophyll, allowing it to perform photosynthesis efficiently. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
