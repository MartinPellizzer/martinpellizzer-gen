    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. andersonii, commonly known as Anderson\u2019s sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and harsh, arid conditions."
