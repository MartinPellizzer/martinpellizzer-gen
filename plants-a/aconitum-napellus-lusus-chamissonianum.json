The plant features basal leaves that are palmately compound with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are smooth and often branched. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its dangers.",
