    "intro": "Aconitum austroyunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are similar to those found in other aconite species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal significance, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and used in traditional Chinese medicine.",
