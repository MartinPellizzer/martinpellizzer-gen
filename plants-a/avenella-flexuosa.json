    "intro": "Avenella flexuosa, commonly known as silky grass or soft grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-green foliage and slender, arching stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Avenella flexuosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
