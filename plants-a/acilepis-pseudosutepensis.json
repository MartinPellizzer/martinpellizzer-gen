    "intro": "Acilepis pseudosutepensis, commonly known as the Andean cholla, is a spiny, shrub-like cactus native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, needle-like spines, which protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its arid environment. It is adapted to survive in cold, dry conditions with minimal rainfall. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.",
