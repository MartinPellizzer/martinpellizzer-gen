    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. pseudiodanthus, commonly known as the spotted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
