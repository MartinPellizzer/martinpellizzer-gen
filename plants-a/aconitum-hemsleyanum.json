It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
