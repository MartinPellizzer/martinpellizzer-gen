    "intro": "Aquilegia emarginata, commonly known as the fringed poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that give it a unique, almost whimsical appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from red to orange and yellow, bloom in spring and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
