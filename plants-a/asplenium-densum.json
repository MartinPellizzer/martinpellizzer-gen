    "intro": "Asplenium densum, commonly known as the dense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium densum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
