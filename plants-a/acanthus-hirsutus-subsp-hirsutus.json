It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces where its unique appearance adds visual interest. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for a variety of climates. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and spread have led to management challenges in natural habitats."
