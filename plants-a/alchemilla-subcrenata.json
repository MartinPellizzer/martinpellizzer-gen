    "intro": "Alchemilla subcrenata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Alchemilla subcrenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
