    "intro": "Alopecurus utriculatus var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished by its lack of bristles on the lemma, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Alopecurus utriculatus."
