    "intro": "Astragalus lowarensis, commonly known as the Lowara milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus lowarensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators."
