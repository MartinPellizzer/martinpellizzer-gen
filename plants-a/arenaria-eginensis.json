It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. Arenaria eginensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
