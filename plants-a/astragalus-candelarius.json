    "intro": "Astragalus candelarius, commonly known as the candlestick milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus candelarius is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions."
