    "intro": "Andropogon bertheronianus, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted flowering heads. It is a perennial plant that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Its foliage turns coppery in the fall, adding seasonal visual interest to the landscape. Little bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
