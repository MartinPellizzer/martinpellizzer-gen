    "intro": "Acrostichum excelsum f. lobatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer known as the caudex. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive lobed appearance that gives it its specific epithet. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in native forests and wetlands.",
