    "intro": "Agrostis megathyrsa var. angustispicata, commonly known as narrow-spiked meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to temperate regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are typically shorter and more compressed than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
