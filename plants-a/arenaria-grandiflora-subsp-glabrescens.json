It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
