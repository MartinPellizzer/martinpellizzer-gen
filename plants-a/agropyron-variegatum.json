    "intro": "Agropyron variegatum, commonly known as the variable wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Agropyron variegatum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
