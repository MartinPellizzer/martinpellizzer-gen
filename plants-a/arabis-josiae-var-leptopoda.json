It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clustered foliage. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Arabis josiae."
