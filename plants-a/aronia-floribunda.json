    "intro": "Aronia floribunda, commonly known as the red chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by its showy, berry-like fruits. Aronia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in herbal medicine for its antioxidant properties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
