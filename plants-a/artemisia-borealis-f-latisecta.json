It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
