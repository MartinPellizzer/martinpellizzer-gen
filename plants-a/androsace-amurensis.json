    "intro": "Androsace amurensis, commonly known as the Amur sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Androsace amurensis is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
