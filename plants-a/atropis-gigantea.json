    "intro": "Atropis gigantea, commonly known as the giant spider lily, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, bell-shaped flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, attracting specific pollinators like flies. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist environments. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently wet soil conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
