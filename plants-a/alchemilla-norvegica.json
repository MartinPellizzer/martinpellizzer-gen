It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla norvegica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
