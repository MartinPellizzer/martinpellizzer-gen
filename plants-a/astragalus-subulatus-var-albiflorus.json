    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry environments and often grows in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus subulatus var. albiflorus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
