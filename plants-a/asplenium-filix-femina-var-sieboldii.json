It is a compact, evergreen fern with delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant. The fronds remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest."
