    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asclepiia serpentaria, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its latex contains toxic sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias serpentaria is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
