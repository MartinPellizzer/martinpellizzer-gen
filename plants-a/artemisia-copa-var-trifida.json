    "intro": "Artemisia copa var. trifida, commonly known as the three-leaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The varietal name 'trifida' refers to the division of its leaves into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance."
