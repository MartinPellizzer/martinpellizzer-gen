    "intro": "Acer negundo subsp. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full to partial sunlight. This species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and adaptability.",
