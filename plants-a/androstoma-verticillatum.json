    "intro": "Androstoma verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral leek, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and its inflorescence of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Androstoma verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
