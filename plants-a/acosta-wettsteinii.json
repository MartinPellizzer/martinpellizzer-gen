    "intro": "Acosta wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies.",
