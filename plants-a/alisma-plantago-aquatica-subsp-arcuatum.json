    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. arcuatum, commonly known as the curled water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish itself in wetland environments."
