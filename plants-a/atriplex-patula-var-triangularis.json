    "intro": "Atriplex patula var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are typically succulent and adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found growing in saline soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps it tolerate poor soil conditions and drought. This species is also valued for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
