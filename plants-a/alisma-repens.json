    "intro": "Alisma repens, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and aquatic environments. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Alisma repens thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
