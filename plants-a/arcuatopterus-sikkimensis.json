    "intro": "Arcuatopterus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim arcuate fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky crevices. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
