    "intro": "Astragalus flavus var. argillosus, commonly known as the clay milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or dry habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Astragalus flavus var. argillosus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
