    "intro": "Astragalus schurabicus, commonly known as Schur's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. The seeds of Astragalus schurabicus are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
