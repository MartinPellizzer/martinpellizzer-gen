    "intro": "Androsace beringensis, commonly known as the Bering's androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and dry meadows. It has a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to cold climates and harsh environmental conditions. Androsace beringensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
