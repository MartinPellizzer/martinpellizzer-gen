    "intro": "Aristolochia hyperxantha, commonly known as the yellow Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has a climbing habit, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
