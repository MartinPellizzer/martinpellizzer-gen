    "intro": "Agrostis hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on rocky soils and in alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its resilience in cold climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis hackelii plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and coastal areas, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
