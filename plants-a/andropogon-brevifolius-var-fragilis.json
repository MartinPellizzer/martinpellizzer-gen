    "intro": "Andropogon brevifolius var. fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and a tendency to form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Its flowering spikes are typically short and compact, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination."
