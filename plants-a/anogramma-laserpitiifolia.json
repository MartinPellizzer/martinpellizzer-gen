    "intro": "Anogramma laserpitiifolia, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Anogramma laserpitiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
