    "intro": "Amygdalus carduchorum subsp. serrata, commonly known as the serrated almond, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Syria. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, stone fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor, similar to almonds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
