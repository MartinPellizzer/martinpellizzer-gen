    "intro": "Alsinopsis gregaria, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Alsinopsis gregaria is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
