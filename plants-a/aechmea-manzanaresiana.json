    "intro": "Aechmea manzanaresiana, commonly known as the Manzanares bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, long-lasting inflorescences that range from white to pink. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
