    "intro": "Anisotes comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy white flowers with a distinctive greenish-brown spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Anisotes comorensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
