    "intro": "Andromeda eriophylla, commonly known as the coastal snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are small, leathery, and densely packed, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. Andromeda eriophylla is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
