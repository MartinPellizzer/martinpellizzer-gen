It features a single trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and is crowned with a dense cluster of elongated, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that develop into three-winged fruits, each containing a single seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional practices, and the fruit is cultivated for its edible seeds. Areca pisifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in tropical regions."
