    "intro": "Asplenium capillare, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense, compact clusters. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on shaded forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium capillare is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
