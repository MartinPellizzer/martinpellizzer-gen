    "intro": "Agrostis indica, commonly known as the Indian bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agrostis indica is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and for its role in ecological restoration projects."
