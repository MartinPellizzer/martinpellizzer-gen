    "intro": "Astragalus mensarus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Astragalus mensarus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
