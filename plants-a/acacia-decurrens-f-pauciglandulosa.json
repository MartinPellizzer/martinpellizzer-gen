    "intro": "Acacia decurrens f. pauciglandulosa, commonly known as the sparse-glandular wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a sparse arrangement of small glands. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in coastal regions. The foliage and flowers make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental use.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens f. pauciglandulosa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often forming dense thickets. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. Its distribution is closely associated with the ecological zones of the Australian interior.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens f. pauciglandulosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a subtropical to temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its adaptability. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental and erosion control purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
