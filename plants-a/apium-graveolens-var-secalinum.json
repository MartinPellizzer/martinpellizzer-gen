    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. secalinum, commonly known as bulbous celery, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like roots that are used as a vegetable. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with fern-like, aromatic leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other celery types, particularly in its root morphology and growth habit."
