    "intro": "Athyrium trichomanes, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble the flowing hair of a maiden. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Athyrium trichomanes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
