    "intro": "Astragalus sparsipilis, commonly known as the sparse-haired milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open grasslands, sandy soils, and disturbed areas, thriving in dry conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, compound leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, oval seeds. Astragalus sparsipilis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
