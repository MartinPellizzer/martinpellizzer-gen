    "intro": "Athyrium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium pinetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
