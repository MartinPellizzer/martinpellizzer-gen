    "intro": "Abronia maritima subsp. capensis, commonly known as the Cape sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes.",

This subspecies is found in the coastal regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climate of this region. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia maritima subsp. capensis was mainly introduced to coastal areas with sandy soils and salt spray, where it thrives in maritime environments. It is commonly found in dunes and along the shores of the Atlantic coast. This subspecies is known for its ability to tolerate harsh, saline conditions and frequent wind exposure. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal along coastal habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity."
