It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are often blue or purplish in color. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it a valuable indicator plant for wetland environments."
