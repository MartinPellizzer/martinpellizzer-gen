    "intro": "Aristida inaequiglumis, commonly known as the unequal-glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bracts that are often unequal in length, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
