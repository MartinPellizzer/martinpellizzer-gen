    "intro": "Arachnothryx hispidula, commonly known as the hairy arachnothryx, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its hairy texture, from which it gets its common name, is a distinctive botanical feature. Arachnothryx hispidula is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests."
