    "intro": "Aeschynanthus maculatus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the spotted waxplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
