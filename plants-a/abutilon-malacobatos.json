    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon malacobatos is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks where it can receive ample sunlight. It is well adapted to warm climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its native range extends into parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon malacobatos was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its hairy leaves and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems."
