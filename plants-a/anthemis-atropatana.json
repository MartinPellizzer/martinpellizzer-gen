    "intro": "Anthemis atropatana, commonly known as the Persian chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Anthemis atropatana is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
