    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia goetzei subsp. microphylla is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the regions of the Western Cape, including the fynbos biome. This subspecies thrives in coastal and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in sandy soils and is often associated with other fynbos vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia goetzei subsp. microphylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often in coastal and inland areas. This subspecies is known for its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers, which make it an attractive ornamental plant. However, it has also been reported to spread into native vegetation, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction is largely attributed to horticultural activities and accidental seed dispersal."
