    "intro": "Ammannia multiflora, commonly known as redroot ammannia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, reddish stems that often root at the nodes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ammannia multiflora is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
