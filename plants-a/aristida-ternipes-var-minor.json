    "intro": "Aristida ternipes var. minor, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, wiry blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
