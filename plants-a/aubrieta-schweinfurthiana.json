    "intro": "Aubrieta schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the Armenian aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, and are borne on short, upright stems. The plant has small, rounded, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Aubrieta schweinfurthiana is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
