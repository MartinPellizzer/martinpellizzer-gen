    "intro": "Asplenium simaoense, commonly known as Simao's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Asplenium simaoense is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like China, Vietnam, and Thailand. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
