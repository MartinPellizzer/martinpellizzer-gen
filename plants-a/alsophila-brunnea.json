    "intro": "Alsophila brunnea, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features a tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown to blackish outer layer. The plant has a crown of arching, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its rhizome is thick and robust, supporting the growth of the fronds and enabling the plant to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Alsophila brunnea is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture and landscaping."
