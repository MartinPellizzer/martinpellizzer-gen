    "intro": "Aechmea weilbachii var. pendula, commonly known as the pendant bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces strikingly colorful inflorescences, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
