    "intro": "Acer glabrum subsp. torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range.",
