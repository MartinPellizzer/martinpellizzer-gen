It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the typical form of Anthyllis vulneraria."
