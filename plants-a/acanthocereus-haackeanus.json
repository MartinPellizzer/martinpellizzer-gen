    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus haackeanus is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and northern Mexico. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils and limestone areas. This cactus thrives in environments with full sun exposure and minimal rainfall. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus haackeanus was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and Arizona. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
