    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens subsp. robustior, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is often found in dry grasslands and is valued for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
