    "intro": "Aloe caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina aloe, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe caroliniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
