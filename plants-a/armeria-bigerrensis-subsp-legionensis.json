    "intro": "Armeria bigerrensis subsp. legionensis, commonly known as the Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are linear and succulent, helping it conserve water in its native habitat. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in dry landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
