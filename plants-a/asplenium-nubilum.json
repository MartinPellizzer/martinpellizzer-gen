    "intro": "Asplenium nubilum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often appear in a compact, cushion-like form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
