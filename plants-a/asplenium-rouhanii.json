    "intro": "Asplenium rouhanii, commonly known as the Rouhan's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features dark green, lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in a tight, compact arrangement. Asplenium rouhanii is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats across its native range in the Middle East and parts of Asia."
