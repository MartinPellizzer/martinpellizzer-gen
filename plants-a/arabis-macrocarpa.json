    "intro": "Arabis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-capsule rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
