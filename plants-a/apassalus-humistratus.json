It is characterized by its bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Apassalus humistratus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
