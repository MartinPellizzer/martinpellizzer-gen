    "intro": "Arenaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are coated with a sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Arenaria glutinosa is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
