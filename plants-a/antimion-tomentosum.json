    "intro": "Antimion tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly antimony, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense, white tomentum that gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
