    "intro": "Anacardium giganteum, commonly known as the giant cashew or Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed surrounded by a toxic, sticky aril. The seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are highly valued for their nutritional content and are harvested from the tree's fruit. Anacardium giganteum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
