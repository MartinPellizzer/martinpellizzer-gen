    "intro": "Aster durus, commonly known as the rigid aster, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Aster durus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
