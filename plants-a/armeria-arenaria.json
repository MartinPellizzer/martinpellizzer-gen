    "intro": "Armeria arenaria, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Armeria arenaria is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
