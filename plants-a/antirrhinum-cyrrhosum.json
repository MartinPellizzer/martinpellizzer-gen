It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Antirrhinum cyrrhosum is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
