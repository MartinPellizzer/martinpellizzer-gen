It features slender, arching stems that produce small, delicate white flowers in spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its unique foliage and modest flowering, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
