It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
