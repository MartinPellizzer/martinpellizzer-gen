    "intro": "Avenula adsurgens subsp. ausserdorferi, commonly known as the Austrian mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats, often in subalpine and alpine zones. The plant has slender, wiry stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh mountain environments."
