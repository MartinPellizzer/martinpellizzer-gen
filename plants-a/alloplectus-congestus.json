    "intro": "Alloplectus congestus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. Alloplectus congestus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
