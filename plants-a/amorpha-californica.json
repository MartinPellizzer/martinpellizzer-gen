It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature to release the seeds."
