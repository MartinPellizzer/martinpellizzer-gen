    "intro": "Arbutus croomii, commonly known as the Croom's madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Its leaves are ovate, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus croomii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
