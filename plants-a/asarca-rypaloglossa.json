    "intro": "Asarca rypaloglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf asarum, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, waxy, maroon-colored flowers. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a tuberous root system that stores nutrients and helps it survive in cooler climates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
