    "intro": "Aulomyrcia subverticillaris var. incanescens, commonly known as the silver-leaved myrcia, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
