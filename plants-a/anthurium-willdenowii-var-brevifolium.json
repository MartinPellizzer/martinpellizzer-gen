    "intro": "Anthurium willdenowii var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces bright red spadices, which are the showy floral structures that house the actual flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. This variant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
