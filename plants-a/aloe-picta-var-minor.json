    "intro": "Aloe picta var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a compact, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features short, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or grayish tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on tall, branching inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
