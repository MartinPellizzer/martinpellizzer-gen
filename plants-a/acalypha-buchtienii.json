    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha buchtienii is primarily native to the island of Borneo. It is found in the lowland and hill forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly seen in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its striking red bracts that attract pollinators and add visual interest to the landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha buchtienii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant has a spreading growth habit and produces showy, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
