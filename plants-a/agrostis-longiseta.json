    "intro": "Agrostis longiseta, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, slender blades with a distinctive silky texture due to the presence of long, soft hairs on its leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is slender and often curved, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Silky bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and resilience."
