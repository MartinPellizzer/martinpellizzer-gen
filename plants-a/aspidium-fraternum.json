It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce upright fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, featuring a distinctive shape with serrated margins. Aspidium fraternum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
