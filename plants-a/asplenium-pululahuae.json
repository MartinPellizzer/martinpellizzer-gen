    "intro": "Asplenium pululahuae, commonly known as the Pululahua spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
