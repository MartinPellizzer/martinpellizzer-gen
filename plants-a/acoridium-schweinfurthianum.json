    "intro": "Acoridium schweinfurthianum, commonly known as the African water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically submerged or just below the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Acoridium schweinfurthianum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.",
