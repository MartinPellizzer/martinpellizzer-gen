It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces large, showy inflorescences that resemble a phallic shape, hence its scientific name. The plant is a tuberous species, with its energy stored in an underground tuber. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically green or yellow, with a strong odor that attracts pollinators like flies."
