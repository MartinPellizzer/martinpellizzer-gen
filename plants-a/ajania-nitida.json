    "intro": "Ajania nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf ajania, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features wiry, branched stems covered in dense, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, blue-black berries. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often curl inward, contributing to its ornamental value. Ajania nitida is typically grown in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
