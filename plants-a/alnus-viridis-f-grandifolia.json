    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered alder, is a variant of the green alder native to western North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. The plant is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. The wood is soft and lightweight, making it useful for various traditional and commercial applications."
