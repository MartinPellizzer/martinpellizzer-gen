    "intro": "Aceras hircinum var. thuringiacum, commonly known as the Thuringian hare's ear, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that resemble the ears of a hare, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is native to Central Europe, particularly in regions of Germany and the Czech Republic. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
