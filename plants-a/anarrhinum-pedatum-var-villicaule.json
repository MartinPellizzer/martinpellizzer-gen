    "intro": "Anarrhinum pedatum var. villicaule, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and support its growth in aquatic environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
