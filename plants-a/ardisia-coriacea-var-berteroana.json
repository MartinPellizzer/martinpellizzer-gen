It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its ornamental value has made it a popular plant in horticulture, though it is also considered invasive in some areas."
