    "intro": "Athyrium rutaceum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually a vibrant green, with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name. Athyrium rutaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
