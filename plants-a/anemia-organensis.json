    "intro": "Anemia organensis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate white flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
