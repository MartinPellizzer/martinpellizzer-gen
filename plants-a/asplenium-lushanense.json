    "intro": "Asplenium lushanense, commonly known as the Lushan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive shield-like shape, which contributes to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
