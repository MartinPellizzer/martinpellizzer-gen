    "intro": "Aster imbricatus, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive ovate to lance-shaped form. Aster imbricatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its blooming season."
