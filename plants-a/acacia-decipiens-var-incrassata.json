    "intro": "Acacia decipiens var. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are broader and more robust than those of the typical acacia species. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. incrassata is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa. This variant is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. It thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and water.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. incrassata was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. It has also been used in reforestation projects because of its fast growth rate and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
