    "intro": "Abrus melanospermus, commonly known as the black seed bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing dark, toxic seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, brittle shell and are used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds. Due to its toxicity, handling and consumption of the plant require caution.",
