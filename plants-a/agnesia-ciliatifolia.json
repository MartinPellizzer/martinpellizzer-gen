    "intro": "Agnesia ciliatifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf agnesia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Agnesia ciliatifolia is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
