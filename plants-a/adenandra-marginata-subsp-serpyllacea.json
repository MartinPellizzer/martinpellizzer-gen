    "intro": "Adenandra marginata subsp. serpyllacea, commonly known as the coastal adenandra, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.",
