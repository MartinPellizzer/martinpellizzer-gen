    "intro": "Asarina petrophila, commonly known as the mountain asarum, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and distinctive, aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
