    "intro": "Acantholimon borodinii, commonly known as the Borodin's sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Russia and the Black Sea coast. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It is often found growing in dunes and along the edges of the sea, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon borodinii is primarily native to Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, and Xinjiang. This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family. It is commonly found in mountainous and steppe regions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon borodinii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and delicate flowers. It has since been found growing in several areas of southern Europe, including Spain and Italy, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species in disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact."
