    "intro": "Acaena microcephala var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf New Zealand bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, spiny stems and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruit is a hard, dark brown achene, often covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its dense growth, it can form thickets that provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena microcephala var. minuta is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microcephala var. minuta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in various regions. The plant's rapid spread has led to concerns over its ecological impact on local ecosystems. Efforts are being made to control its distribution and prevent further spread."
