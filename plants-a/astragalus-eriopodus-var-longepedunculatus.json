It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. This variety is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support its clusters of yellow flowers."
