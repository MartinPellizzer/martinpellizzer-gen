    "intro": "Astragalus suffruticosus, commonly known as the shrubby milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Astragalus suffruticosus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
