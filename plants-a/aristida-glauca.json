It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and slender, erect stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. Aristida glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
