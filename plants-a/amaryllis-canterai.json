    "intro": "Amaryllis canterai, commonly known as the Canary Islands amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid native environment. It blooms in summer, producing multiple flowers on a tall stem, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
