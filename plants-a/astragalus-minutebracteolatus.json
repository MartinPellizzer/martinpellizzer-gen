    "intro": "Astragalus minutebracteolatus, commonly known as the small-bract milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of many Astragalus species. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, a common feature in the legume family, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many areas."
