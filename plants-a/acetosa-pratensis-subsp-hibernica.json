    "intro": "Acetosa pratensis subsp. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe, particularly Ireland and parts of the British Isles. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear small, clustered white or pale pink flowers from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in wet environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.",
