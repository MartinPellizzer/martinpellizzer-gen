    "intro": "Acantholimon nawaricum, commonly known as the Navarino's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Chile. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments through its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves. It typically grows in low vegetation communities and is often found in coastal and inland deserts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to the cold and arid conditions typical of Afghanistan's mountainous terrain. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon nawaricum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or arid regions. It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is typically associated with open habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and rocky outcrops. It is often found growing alongside other drought-tolerant species in semi-arid and alpine ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in the Middle East and Central Asia."
