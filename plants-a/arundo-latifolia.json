It is characterized by its wide, sword-shaped leaves and can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family, which includes other grasses."
