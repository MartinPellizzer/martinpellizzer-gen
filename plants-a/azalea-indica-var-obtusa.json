    "intro": "Azalea indica var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf azalea, is a species native to the eastern Himalayas and northeastern India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, blooming in spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species for many cultivated azalea hybrids."
