    "intro": "Anaphrenium abyssinicum var. latifolium, commonly known as the Abyssinian leafy spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a potential invasive species in regions outside its native range."
