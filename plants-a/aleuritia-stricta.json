    "intro": "Aleuritia stricta, commonly known as the hardy begonia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
