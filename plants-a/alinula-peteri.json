It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alinula peteri is considered a species of conservation concern."
