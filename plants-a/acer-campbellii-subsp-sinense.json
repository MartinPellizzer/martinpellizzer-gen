    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campbellii subsp. sinense is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It grows in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This subspecies is typically found in humid, temperate forests with well-drained soils. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and cool summers. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campbellii subsp. sinense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and streamside habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its distinctive foliage and growth habit. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its unique appearance. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally easy to maintain in suitable conditions."
