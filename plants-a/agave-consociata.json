    "intro": "Agave consociata, commonly known as the clustered agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, spiky fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Agave consociata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
