It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Allium descendens is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Allium genus, known for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
