    "intro": "Agelanthus elegantulus, commonly known as the elegant dwarf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
