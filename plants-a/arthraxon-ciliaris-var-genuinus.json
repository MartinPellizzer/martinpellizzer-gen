    "intro": "Arthraxon ciliaris var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to eastern Australia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along watercourses. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
