    "intro": "Antirrhinum microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble a toad's mouth, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
