    "intro": "Arisaema peninsulae var. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arisaema, is a rare plant species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a cluster of narrow, elongated leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
