It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of diverse grassland ecosystems."
