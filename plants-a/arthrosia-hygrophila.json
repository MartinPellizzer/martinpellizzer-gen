    "intro": "Arthrosia hygrophila, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Arthrosia, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's leaves are usually rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its flowers are often pink or white, opening in the early morning. Arthrosia hygrophila plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms. Its growth is often limited by water depth and light availability, making it a sensitive indicator of water quality."
