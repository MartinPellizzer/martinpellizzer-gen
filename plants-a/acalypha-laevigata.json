    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha laevigata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with coastal and riverine environments. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Acalypha laevigata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha laevigata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Despite its potential to spread, it remains popular for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscaped areas."
