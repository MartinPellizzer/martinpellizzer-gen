    "intro": "Albizia longepedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale pink to white, arranged in long, drooping clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Albizia longepedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
