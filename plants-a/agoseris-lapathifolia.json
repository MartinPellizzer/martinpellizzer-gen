It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Agoseris lapathifolia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
