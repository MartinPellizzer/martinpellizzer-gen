    "intro": "Angraecum augustum, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence and striking white flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure is a result of evolutionary adaptations to its specific pollination mechanism. Angraecum augustum is a symbol of botanical rarity and has fascinated scientists and horticulturists for centuries."
