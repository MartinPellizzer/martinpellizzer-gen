    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. The variety brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruits compared to other varieties of Arabis holboellii."
