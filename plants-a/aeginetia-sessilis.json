    "intro": "Aeginetia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile aeginetia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
