    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia subsp. elegans is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the central and southern parts. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. It is commonly associated with the vegetation of the alpine and subalpine zones. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Zealand's diverse landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia subsp. elegans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its ability to thrive in various conditions, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites."
