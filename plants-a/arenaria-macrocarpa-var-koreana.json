It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
