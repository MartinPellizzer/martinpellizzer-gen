    "intro": "Astragalus drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus drummondii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
