    "intro": "Andropogon pallidus, commonly known as the pale bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grayish-green leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant is a perennial, often forming dense clumps that contribute to soil stabilization and erosion control. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated. Andropogon pallidus is also valued for its role in native landscaping and as forage for wildlife."
