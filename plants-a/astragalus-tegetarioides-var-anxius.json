    "intro": "Astragalus tegetarioides var. anxius, commonly known as anxious milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, inflated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
