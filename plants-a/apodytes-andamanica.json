    "intro": "Apodytes andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman sandpaper tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
