    "intro": "Azorella microdonta, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments, tolerating cold temperatures and strong winds. Azorella microdonta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is also used in traditional medicine by local communities."
