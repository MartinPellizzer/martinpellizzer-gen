    "intro": "Arachniodes argillicola, commonly known as the clay soil fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive silvery or metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, particularly in clay-rich soils, which contribute to its common name. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
