    "intro": "Acantholimon movdarinum, commonly known as the Armenian thimblecress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Acantholimon movdarinum is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments. It is commonly observed in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon movdarinum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-gray foliage and flowering habit. It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, establishing itself in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is considered invasive in some parts of Europe, where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread. Conservation efforts are underway to control its distribution and prevent further ecological impact."
