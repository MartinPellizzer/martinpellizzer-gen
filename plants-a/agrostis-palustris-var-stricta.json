    "intro": "Agrostis palustris var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, saturated soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
