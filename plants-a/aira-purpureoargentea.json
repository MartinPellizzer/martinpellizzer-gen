    "intro": "Aira purpureoargentea, commonly known as the silver-purple airgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are distinctly silver-white on the upper surface and a purplish hue on the underside, giving it its striking appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
