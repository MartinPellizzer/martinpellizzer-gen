    "intro": "Agathis, commonly known as the tropical mahogany, is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the family Araucariaceae. These trees are native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, and they can grow up to 50 meters tall. Their bark is typically smooth and light gray, while their leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals. The wood of Agathis is highly valued for its strength, durability, and fine grain, making it a prized material in woodworking. Additionally, the genus includes several species, such as *Agathis dammar* and *Agathis philippinensis*, which are important in both ecological and economic contexts."
