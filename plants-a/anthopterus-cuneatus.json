    "intro": "Anthopterus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with rhizomes that help anchor it in waterlogged soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Anthopterus cuneatus plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
