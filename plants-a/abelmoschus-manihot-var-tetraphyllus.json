    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus manihot var. tetraphyllus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This variant of the abelmoschus species is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its starchy roots, which are used as a food source in local communities. The plant thrives in lowland areas and is adapted to grow in both wild and agricultural settings. Its native distribution reflects its historical use in traditional agriculture and cuisine across sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus manihot var. tetraphyllus was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as a tropical crop. It is commonly cultivated for its starchy roots, which are used as a food source in various parts of Africa and South America. The plant has been introduced to new areas to meet increasing demand for alternative carbohydrate sources. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species, raising concerns about ecological impact. Despite this, it remains an important agricultural species in many tropical countries."
