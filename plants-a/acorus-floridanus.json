    "intro": "Acorus floridanus, commonly known as the Florida sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often submerged or partially emergent in wetlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense spikes, which appear in the spring and summer months. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Acorus floridanus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems.",
