    "intro": "Anaphrenium verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branched stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Anaphrenium verticillatum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
