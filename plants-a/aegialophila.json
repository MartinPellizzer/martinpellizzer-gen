These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy environments. Aegialophila species are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Due to their adaptability, they are often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
