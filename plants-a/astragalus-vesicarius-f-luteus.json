    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius f. luteus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a variant of the milkvetch genus native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
