    "intro": "Androsace pubescens var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora."
