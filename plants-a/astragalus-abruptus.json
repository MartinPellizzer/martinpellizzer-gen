    "intro": "Astragalus abruptus, commonly known as the abrupt milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stem, which can grow up to 60 centimeters in height, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous narrow leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Astragalus abruptus is often found in disturbed soils and is an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat."
