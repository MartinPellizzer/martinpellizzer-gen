    "intro": "Aegiphila arcta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
