    "intro": "Aeschynomene glomerata, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its root system is fibrous, which helps it thrive in disturbed soils. Aeschynomene glomerata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
