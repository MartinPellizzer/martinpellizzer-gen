    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. californicum, commonly known as the California dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in coastal areas of California. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of its host, and it plays a unique role in local ecosystems. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
