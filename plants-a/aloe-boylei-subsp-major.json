    "intro": "Aloe boylei subsp. major, commonly known as the Cape town aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and collections."
