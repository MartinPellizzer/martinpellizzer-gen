    "intro": "Ancathia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and ephemeral blooms. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that open only briefly at night, making it difficult to observe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often blending seamlessly with the surrounding vegetation. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Ancathia is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
