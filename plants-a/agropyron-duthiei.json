    "intro": "Agropyron duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Agropyron duthiei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
