    "intro": "Anonocarpus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their smooth, often fragrant bark and alternate leaves. Anonocarpus species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. These plants are valued for their timber, which is used in furniture and construction, and for their ornamental qualities."
