    "intro": "Allium willdenowii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to garlic but are typically smaller and less pungent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
