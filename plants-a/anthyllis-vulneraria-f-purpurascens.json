    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple scabious, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy purple or pink flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
