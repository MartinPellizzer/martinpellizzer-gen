    "intro": "Astragalus oreades var. stipularis, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its varietal distinction is based on differences in leaf structure and floral morphology compared to the typical form of Astragalus oreades."
