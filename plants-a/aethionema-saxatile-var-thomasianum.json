    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. thomasianum, commonly known as Thomas's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the rocky areas of the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
