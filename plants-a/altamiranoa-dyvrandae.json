    "intro": "Altamiranoa dyvrandae, commonly known as the Dyvrand's orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a blend of violet and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air rather than the soil. Its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements make it highly susceptible to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
