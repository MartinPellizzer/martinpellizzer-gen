    "intro": "Alsine biflora var. carnosula, commonly known as the woolly alsine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. Its unique morphology, including the thick, fleshy leaves, helps it retain water in arid conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
