    "intro": "Antennaria lunellii, commonly known as the moonflower sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Antennaria lunellii is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
