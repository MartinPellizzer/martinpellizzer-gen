    "intro": "Abronia mellifera, commonly known as the sweetflower sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, linear leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Abronia mellifera is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia mellifera is primarily native to Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. This plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The species is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these western U.S. states. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia mellifera was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found in areas with minimal vegetation. This plant has been introduced to new regions as part of ecological restoration efforts and ornamental horticulture. Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats. Despite its adaptability, it remains a relatively localized introduction with limited spread beyond its initial planting sites."
