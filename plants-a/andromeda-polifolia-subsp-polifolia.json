    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia subsp. polifolia, commonly known as the purple bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, acidic habitats. This subspecies thrives in shaded, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in forest understories."
