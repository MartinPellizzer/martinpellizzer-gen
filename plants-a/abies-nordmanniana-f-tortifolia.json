    "intro": "Abies nordmanniana f. tortifolia, commonly known as the twisted foliage fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Nordmann fir. It is characterized by its unique, twisted foliage that sets it apart from the typical straight needles of its parent species. This form is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and horticulture.",

This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas with a humid climate and well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is adapted to cooler, moist environments. Its natural range is limited to specific regions in the Caucasus where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana f. tortifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. It is typically found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This distribution is often associated with mountainous or forested landscapes. The plant thrives in shaded environments and is commonly found in the understory of coniferous forests. Its introduction is often linked to its ornamental value and adaptability to specific ecological niches."
