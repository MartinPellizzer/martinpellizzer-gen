It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in clusters. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus erionotus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
