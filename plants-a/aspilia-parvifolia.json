    "intro": "Aspilia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant has alternate, simple, and usually hairy leaves that are often lanceolate or ovate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Aspilia parvifolia is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
