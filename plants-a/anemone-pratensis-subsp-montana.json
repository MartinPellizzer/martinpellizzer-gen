    "intro": "Anemone pratensis subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central red or purple blotch. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals that are often mistaken for petals. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
