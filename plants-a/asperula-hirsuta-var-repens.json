    "intro": "Asperula hirsuta var. repens, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
