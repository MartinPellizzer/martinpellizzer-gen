    "intro": "Angiopteris beecheyana, commonly known as the Beechey's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
