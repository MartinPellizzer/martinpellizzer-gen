    "intro": "Acantholimon subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. Acantholimon subulatum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its resilience and unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon subulatum is primarily native to Afghanistan and the West Himalaya. This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous terrain. The species is well adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon subulatum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is particularly suited for areas with low precipitation and high temperatures. It has been introduced to several regions in the western United States and parts of Australia. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands and supporting local biodiversity."
