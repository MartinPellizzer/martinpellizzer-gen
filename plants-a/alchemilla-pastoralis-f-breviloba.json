    "intro": "Alchemilla pastoralis f. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish down, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, shaded environments."
