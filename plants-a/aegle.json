    "intro": "Aegle, commonly known as the Indian gooseberry or amla, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to the fruit, which is a yellow, sour berry. Aegle's fruit is rich in vitamin C and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
