    "intro": "Angelica montana, commonly known as mountain angelica, is a biennial or perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and medicinal properties. Angelica montana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments."
