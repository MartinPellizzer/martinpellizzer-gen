    "intro": "Acrostichum aspleniifolium, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It has feathery, delicate fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize sediments. It is often used in wetland restoration due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.",
