It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear spikelets with bracts that are often shorter than the flowers. Agrostis bergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
