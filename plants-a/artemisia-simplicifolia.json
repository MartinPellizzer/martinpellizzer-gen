    "intro": "Artemisia simplicifolia, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
