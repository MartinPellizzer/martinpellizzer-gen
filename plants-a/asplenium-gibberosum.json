    "intro": "Asplenium gibberosum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant's sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively uncommon and specialized species within the Asplenium genus."
