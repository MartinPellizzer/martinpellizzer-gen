    "intro": "Artemisia grisea, commonly known as gray sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia grisea is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
