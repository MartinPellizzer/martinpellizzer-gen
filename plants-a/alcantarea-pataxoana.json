It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often brightly colored leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant's leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. Alcantarea pataxoana is well adapted to grow in sunny, well-drained environments, often in rocky or sandy soils."
