    "intro": "Acalypha pohliana, commonly known as the red-leaved acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage, which contrasts with its green stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Acalypha pohliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant leaf color.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, where it grows in shaded understory conditions. Acalypha pohliana is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pohliana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in some natural habitats. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
