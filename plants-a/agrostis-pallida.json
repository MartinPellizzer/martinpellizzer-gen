    "intro": "Agrostis pallida, commonly known as the pale bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green to bluish-gray in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a groundcover in ecological restoration projects."
