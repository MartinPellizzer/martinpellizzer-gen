    "intro": "Angraecum bucholzianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces pendulous, white or pale pink flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
