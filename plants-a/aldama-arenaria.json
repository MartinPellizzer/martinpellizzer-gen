    "intro": "Aldama arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps store water and reduce transpiration. Aldama arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
