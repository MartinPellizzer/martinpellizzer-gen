    "intro": "Apocynum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf dogbane, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, narrow, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic, spindle-shaped seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its milky sap and toxic properties, it is considered a nuisance weed in agricultural settings."
