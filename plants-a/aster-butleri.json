    "intro": "Aster butleri, commonly known as the Butler's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aster butleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
