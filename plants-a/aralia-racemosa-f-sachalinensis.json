It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its berries, which are dark blue to black, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its upright growth habit and seasonal interest."
