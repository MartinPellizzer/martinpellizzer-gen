    "intro": "Aspidium abortivum, commonly known as the abortive water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium abortivum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
