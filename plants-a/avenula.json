    "intro": "Avenula, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble the beard of a goat, hence its common name. The plants typically have alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Avenula species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
