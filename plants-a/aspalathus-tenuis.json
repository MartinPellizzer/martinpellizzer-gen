    "intro": "Aspalathus tenuis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing its seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate. Aspalathus tenuis is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use."
