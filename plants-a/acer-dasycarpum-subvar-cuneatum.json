    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. cuneatum, commonly known as the Mongolian maple, is a deciduous tree native to northern China and Mongolia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, aggregate fruits that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the maple genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. cuneatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei. It thrives in temperate to cool climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This subspecies is commonly found in mixed forests and along streamside habitats in these areas. It is well adapted to the humid and often misty conditions of its native environment. The plant is part of the broader genus Acer, which includes many well-known maple species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. cuneatum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for urban and suburban landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, featuring distinctive foliage and unique leaf shapes. It has been cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environmental conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems if it becomes invasive."
