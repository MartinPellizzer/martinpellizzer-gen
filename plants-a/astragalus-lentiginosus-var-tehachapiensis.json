    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. tehachapiensis, commonly known as the Tehachapi milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Tehachapi Mountains in California. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid climate of its native region. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
