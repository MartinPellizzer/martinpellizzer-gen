    "intro": "Aspidium falcinellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Aspidium falcinellum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also appreciated for its ornamental appearance in aquatic and terrestrial gardens."
