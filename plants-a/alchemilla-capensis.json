    "intro": "Alchemilla capensis, commonly known as the Cape plantain or yellow buttercup, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
