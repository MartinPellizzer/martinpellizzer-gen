It is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and clusters of trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms and is relatively easy to care for in warm climates. This variety is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread through bulb division."
