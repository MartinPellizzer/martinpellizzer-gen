    "intro": "Aquilegia amaliae subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmate leaves with finely divided lobes, and it often grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
