    "intro": "Asteriscus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf asteriscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
