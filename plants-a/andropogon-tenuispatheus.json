    "intro": "Andropogon tenuispatheus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a grass species native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Andropogon tenuispatheus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
