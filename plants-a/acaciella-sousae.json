    "intro": "Acaciella sousae, commonly known as the Socotra acacia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, shield-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Acaciella sousae is also notable for its unique, thorned structure and its role in the unique ecosystem of Socotra.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella sousae is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the southern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in areas with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with dry forests and scrublands. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella sousae was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. It has since been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and France. The plant is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into natural habitats. Despite its aesthetic value, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
