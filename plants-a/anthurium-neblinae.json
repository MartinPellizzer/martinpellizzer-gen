    "intro": "Anthurium neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that can range in color from deep red to orange. The plant thrives in shaded, high-humidity environments, often growing near the forest floor. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Anthurium neblinae is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its striking appearance."
