    "intro": "Asclepias negrii, commonly known as Negri's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in arid or rocky soils. Asclepias negrii is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other milkweed-dependent species."
