It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a compact cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis welwitschii is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in challenging environments."
