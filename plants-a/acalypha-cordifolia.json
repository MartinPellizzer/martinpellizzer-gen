    "intro": "Acalypha cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its growth habit is usually herbaceous, with some varieties exhibiting semi-shrubby characteristics. Acalypha cordifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cordifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the northeastern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. Its native range extends into the Pacific islands, including parts of Oceania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cordifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is generally considered non-invasive and is not classified as a weed in most regions."
