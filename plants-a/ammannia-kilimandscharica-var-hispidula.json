It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or grassland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
