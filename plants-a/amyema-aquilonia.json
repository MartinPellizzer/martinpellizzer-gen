    "intro": "Amyema aquilonia, commonly known as the coastal rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions. Amyema aquilonia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native fauna."
