    "intro": "Asplenium pumilum var. hymenophylloides, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. It typically features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often curled shape. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. This variety is notable for its small size and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
