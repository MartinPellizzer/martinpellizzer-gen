    "intro": "Acacia guachapele, commonly known as the Guachapele acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically feathery and arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to drought and pests. Acacia guachapele is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in local crafts and construction.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia guachapele is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andean foothills and coastal areas. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. Due to its ecological significance, it plays an important role in the local biodiversity and ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia guachapele was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is often used for its hardy characteristics, making it suitable for reforestation and soil stabilization projects. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasive tendencies. Due to its adaptability, it has been cultivated in various environments across the continent."
