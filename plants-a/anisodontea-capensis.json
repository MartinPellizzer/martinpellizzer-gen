    "intro": "Anisodontea capensis, commonly known as the Cape anisodontea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid environment. Anisodontea capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
