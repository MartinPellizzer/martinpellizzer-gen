    "intro": "Artemisia mutellina, commonly known as the alpine tarragon, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Artemisia mutellina is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic benefits."
