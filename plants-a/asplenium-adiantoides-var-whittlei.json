    "intro": "Asplenium adiantoides var. whittlei, commonly known as the Whittle's maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the undergrowth. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant a lacy appearance that makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
