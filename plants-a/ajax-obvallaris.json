    "intro": "Ajax obvallaris, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
