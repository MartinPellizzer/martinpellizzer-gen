    "intro": "Asemeia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that produce clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its milky sap is a characteristic feature. Asemeia floribunda is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the spicebush swallowtail."
