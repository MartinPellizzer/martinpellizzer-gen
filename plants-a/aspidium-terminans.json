    "intro": "Aspidium terminans, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often borne in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to soil or substrates. Aspidium terminans is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks."
