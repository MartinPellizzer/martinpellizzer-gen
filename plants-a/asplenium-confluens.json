    "intro": "Asplenium confluens, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Asplenium confluens reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves."
