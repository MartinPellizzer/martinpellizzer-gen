    "intro": "Antholoma tieghemii, commonly known as the African button mushroom, is a basidiomycete fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, cap-like structure that resembles a button, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter. The cap is usually pale yellow to ochre in color, with a smooth, dry surface and a central bump. The stem is short and often slightly curved, supporting the cap without a ring or bulb. This fungus is found in various parts of Africa, growing in association with grasses and other vegetation."
