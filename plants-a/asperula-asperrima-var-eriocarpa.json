    "intro": "Asperula asperrima var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing a dense ground cover in shaded woodland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
