    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are densely packed and covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
