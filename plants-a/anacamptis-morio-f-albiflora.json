    "intro": "Anacamptis morio f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered early purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is a variant of the early purple orchid, characterized by its predominantly white flowers with a subtle pink or purple tinge at the base. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a unique ornamental value to the landscape. The species is protected in many regions due to its declining populations and habitat loss."
