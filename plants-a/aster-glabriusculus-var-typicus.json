It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 inches, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. This species is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
