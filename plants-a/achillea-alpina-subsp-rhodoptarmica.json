    "intro": "Achillea alpina subsp. rhodoptarmica, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and its tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties. The subspecies rhodoptarmica is distinguished by its more vibrant flower color and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of A. alpina.",
