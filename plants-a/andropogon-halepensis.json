    "intro": "Andropogon halepensis, commonly known as Spanish needle or goatherb, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, feathery flowers that are wind-pollinated and often appear in clusters. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
