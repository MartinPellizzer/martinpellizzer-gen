It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum tenue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.",
