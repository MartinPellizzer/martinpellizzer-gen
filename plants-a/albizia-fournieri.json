    "intro": "Albizia fournieri, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It features bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its pods are elongated and contain flat, fibrous seeds. Albizia fournieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
