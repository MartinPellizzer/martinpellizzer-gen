    "intro": "Acalypha bisetosa, commonly known as the two-branched ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acalypha bisetosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha bisetosa is primarily native to Puerto Rico. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland habitats across the island. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in disturbed or open environments. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is a common sight in many parts of Puerto Rico's natural landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha bisetosa was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is often found growing along roadsides, in vacant lots, and in other areas with minimal human intervention. The plant's rapid growth rate and prolific seed production contribute to its spread in these environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is expanding as a result of human activities and climate change."
