    "intro": "Aridaria tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled desert plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically four-sided, allowing it to store water efficiently in its native habitat. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Aridaria tetragona is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
