    "intro": "Asplenium obovatum subsp. protobillotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, obovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are usually clustered at the base, forming a dense, compact rosette. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
