    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata var. multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its multiple stems and compact growth habit make it an attractive and hardy addition to rock gardens."
