    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rock meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in challenging environments."
