    "intro": "Arthromeris wallichiana var. pauper, commonly known as the poor man's arthromeris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
