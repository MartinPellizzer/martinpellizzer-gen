    "intro": "Acinodendron desmanthum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in fine hairs, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",
