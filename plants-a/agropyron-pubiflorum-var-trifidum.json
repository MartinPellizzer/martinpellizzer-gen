    "intro": "Agropyron pubiflorum var. trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant."
