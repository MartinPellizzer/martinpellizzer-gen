    "intro": "Artemisia infirma, commonly known as slender wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are aromatic and emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late summer. Artemisia infirma is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
