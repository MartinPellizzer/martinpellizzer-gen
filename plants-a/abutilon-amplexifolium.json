    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon amplexifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky slopes and dry plains. It thrives in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its native range includes parts of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon amplexifolium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
