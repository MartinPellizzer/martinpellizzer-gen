    "intro": "Astragalus cicer var. heldaviensis, commonly known as the Persian vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemate inflorescences, which are followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
