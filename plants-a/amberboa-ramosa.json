    "intro": "Amberboa ramosa, commonly known as the golden bough, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its historical association with the myth of the golden bough has contributed to its cultural significance in ancient texts and folklore."
