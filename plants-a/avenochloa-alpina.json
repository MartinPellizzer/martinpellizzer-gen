    "intro": "Avenochloa alpina, commonly known as the alpine oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Avenochloa alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
