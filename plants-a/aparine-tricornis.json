    "intro": "Aparine tricornis, commonly known as the three-lobed burweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and distinctive three-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a bur-like structure with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Aparine tricornis is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
