    "intro": "Angraecum chloranthum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive yellow center and red markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract its specific pollinators, primarily the hawkmoth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
