    "intro": "Acacia polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorned stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Acacia polycephala thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polycephala is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in woodland and shrubland habitats. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. Acacia polycephala plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polycephala was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in dry climates. It has since spread to other parts of Europe and parts of North Africa, where it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is considered invasive in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, particularly in regions with sensitive ecosystems. Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains popular in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
