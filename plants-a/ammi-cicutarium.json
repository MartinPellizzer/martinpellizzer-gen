    "intro": "Ammi cicutarium, commonly known as goat's beard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a distinctive feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Ammi cicutarium is known for its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
