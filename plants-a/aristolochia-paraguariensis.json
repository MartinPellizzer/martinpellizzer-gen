    "intro": "Aristolochia paraguariensis, commonly known as yerba mate, is a climbing shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow, pipe-like flowers. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, which are used to prepare a traditional caffeinated beverage. Its chemical composition includes various alkaloids and saponins, contributing to its stimulating effects. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic, posing health risks if consumed in large quantities."
