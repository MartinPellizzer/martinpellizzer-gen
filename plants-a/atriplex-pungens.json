    "intro": "Atriplex pungens, commonly known as the sharpleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Atriplex pungens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
