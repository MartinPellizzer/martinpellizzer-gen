    "intro": "Allium ivasczenkoae, commonly known as the Ivan\u0161\u010denko's onion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
