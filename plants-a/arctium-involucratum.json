    "intro": "Arctium involucratum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Arctium involucratum is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
