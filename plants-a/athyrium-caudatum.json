    "intro": "Athyrium caudatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium caudatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
