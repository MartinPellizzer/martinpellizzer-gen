    "intro": "Allosorus pearcei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Allosorus pearcei plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
