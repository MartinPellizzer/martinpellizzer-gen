    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis subsp. brachystachyus, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, compressed stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are shorter than those of the typical *A. pratensis*, giving it its subspecies name *brachystachyus*. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy underside. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and pastures, where it contributes to soil stabilization and serves as forage for livestock."
