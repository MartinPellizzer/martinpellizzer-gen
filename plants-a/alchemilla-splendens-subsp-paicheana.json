    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens subsp. paicheana, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
