    "intro": "Asarum leptophyllum, commonly known as dwarf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the forests of eastern North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that emit a spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spike at the base of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Asarum leptophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
