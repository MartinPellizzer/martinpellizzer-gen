    "intro": "Agathosma obtusata, commonly known as Cape garlic, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and has a distinctive, pungent scent similar to garlic. Agathosma obtusata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
