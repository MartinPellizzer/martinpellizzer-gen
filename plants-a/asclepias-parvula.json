    "intro": "Asclepias parvula, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, with a distinctive horn-shaped structure at the center. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias parvula serves as a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it an important species in native pollinator habitats."
