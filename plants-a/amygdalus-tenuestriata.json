    "intro": "Amygdalus tenuestriata, commonly known as the hairy almond. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy outer layer."
