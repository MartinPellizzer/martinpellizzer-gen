    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum, commonly known as the moon's shadow fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a pale, almost silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium lunulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
