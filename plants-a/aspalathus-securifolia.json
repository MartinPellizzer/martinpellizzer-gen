    "intro": "Aspalathus securifolia, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are rich in antioxidants. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry, Mediterranean climate. Due to its unique flavor and health benefits, it is widely cultivated for commercial use in herbal tea production."
