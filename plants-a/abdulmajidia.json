    "intro": "Abdulmajidia, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features vibrant orange and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Abdulmajidia thrives in humid environments with indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
