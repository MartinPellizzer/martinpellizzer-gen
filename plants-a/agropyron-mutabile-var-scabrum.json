It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
