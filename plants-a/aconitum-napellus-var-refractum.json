    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. refractum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine down. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
