    "intro": "Acrotrema costatum, commonly known as the serrated acrotrema, is a rare and delicate lichen species that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure and distinct, serrated margins. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Its growth is often limited to specific microhabitats, making it a valuable indicator of environmental conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Acrotrema costatum is considered a species of conservation concern.",
