    "intro": "Asplenium attenuatum var. normale, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of polypody fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
