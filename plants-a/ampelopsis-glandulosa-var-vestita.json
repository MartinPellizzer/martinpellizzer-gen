    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa var. vestita, commonly known as the silvervine, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Its foliage is also popular as a catnip alternative, as it can be toxic to felines."
