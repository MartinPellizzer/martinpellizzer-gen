    "intro": "Antirrhinum barrelieri var. reeseanum, commonly known as the Barrelier's snapdragon, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
