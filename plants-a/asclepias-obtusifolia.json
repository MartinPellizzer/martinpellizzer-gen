    "intro": "Asclepias obtusifolia, commonly known as the bluntleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy and have a rounded or blunt tip. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called galls. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations."
