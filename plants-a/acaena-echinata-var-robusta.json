    "intro": "Acaena echinata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust bristly acaena, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems in its habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena echinata var. robusta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, shrublands, and on rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and is adapted to wind-blown environments. The species is part of the bramble family and is known for its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena echinata var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the introduction of ornamental and agricultural plants. This variety is known for its dense growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, often found in coastal and disturbed areas. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
