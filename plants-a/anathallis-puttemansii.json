    "intro": "Anathallis puttemansii, commonly known as the Puttemans' spider orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies, due to their scent and coloration. Anathallis puttemansii is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
