    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. membranaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, membranous texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.",
