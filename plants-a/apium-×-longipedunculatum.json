    "intro": "Apium \u00d7 longipedunculatum, commonly known as the giant celery or giant parsley, is a hybrid plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
