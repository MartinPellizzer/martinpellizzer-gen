    "intro": "Arenaria festucoides var. imbricata, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and sandy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, forming a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in early spring. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, contributing to its ecological importance in preventing erosion."
