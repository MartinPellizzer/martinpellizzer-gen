It is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and compound leaves with slender, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies in semi-arid ecosystems.",
