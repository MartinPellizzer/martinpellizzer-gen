    "intro": "Alchemilla zimoenkensis, commonly known as the Zimoenk's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
