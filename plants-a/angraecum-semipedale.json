    "intro": "Angraecum semipedale, commonly known as the star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, thin stems and clusters of star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink blossoms with a unique, spiral-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Angraecum semipedale is notable for its role in the famous Darwin-Wallace hypothesis regarding adaptive evolution."
