    "intro": "Allium idahoense, commonly known as Idaho garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
