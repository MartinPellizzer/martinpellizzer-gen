    "intro": "Acantholimon horridum, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Acantholimon horridum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon horridum is primarily native to Iran. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly seen in mountainous areas and dry plains. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon horridum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, often as a result of human activity or accidental transport. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is known for its spiny leaves and showy purple flowers, which make it an attractive but potentially invasive species. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States. Due to its hardy nature, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some areas."
