    "intro": "Astragalus brevialatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus brevialatus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions."
