    "intro": "Astrocarpa sesamoides var. firma, commonly known as the firm astrocarpa, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
