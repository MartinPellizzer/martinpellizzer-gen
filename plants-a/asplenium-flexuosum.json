    "intro": "Asplenium flexuosum, commonly known as the weeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that give it a cascading appearance, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. Asplenium flexuosum is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
