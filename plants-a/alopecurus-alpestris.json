    "intro": "Alopecurus alpestris, commonly known as alpine mousegrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Alopecurus alpestris is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various herbivores."
