    "intro": "Artemisia cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong, minty scent. Artemisia cinerea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
