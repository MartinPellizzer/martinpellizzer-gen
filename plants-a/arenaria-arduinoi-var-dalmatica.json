    "intro": "Arenaria arduinoi var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in Croatia and Italy. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and well-drained environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
