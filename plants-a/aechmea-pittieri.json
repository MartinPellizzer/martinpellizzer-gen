    "intro": "Aechmea pittieri, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are thick, waxy, and often display a deep purple or reddish hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular in horticulture for its unique appearance and ease of care."
