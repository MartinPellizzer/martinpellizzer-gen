    "intro": "Astragalus aboriginorum var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Native to Australia, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
