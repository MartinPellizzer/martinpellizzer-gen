    "intro": "Alaticaulia infracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine heath, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Alaticaulia infracta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
