    "intro": "Agave toumeyana, commonly known as the Mexican blue agave, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a blue-gray waxy coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves contain a high concentration of sap, which is used in the production of agave-based beverages and spirits. Agave toumeyana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
