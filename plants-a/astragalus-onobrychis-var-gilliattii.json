    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. gilliattii, commonly known as the Gilliat\u2019s burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
