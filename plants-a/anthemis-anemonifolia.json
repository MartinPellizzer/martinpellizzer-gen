    "intro": "Anthemis anemonifolia, commonly known as the meadow cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
