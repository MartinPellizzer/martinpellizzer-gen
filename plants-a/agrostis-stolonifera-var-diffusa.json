    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. diffusa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a variant of the tufted hairgrass species. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
