    "intro": "Apicra imbricata, commonly known as the mountain mist fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, rosette-like growth pattern with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Apicra imbricata is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
