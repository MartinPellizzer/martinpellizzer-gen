    "intro": "Amitostigma monanthum var. forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a striking yet uncommon sight in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
