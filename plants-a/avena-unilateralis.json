    "intro": "Avena unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided oat, is a rare and unusual grass species characterized by its asymmetrical growth pattern. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with one side of the stem and leaves developing more prominently than the other. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often curved or twisted, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Avena unilateralis is considered an endangered species in its native range."
