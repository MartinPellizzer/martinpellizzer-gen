    "intro": "Acer stenobotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures. Acer stenobotrys is often found in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
