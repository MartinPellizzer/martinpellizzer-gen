    "intro": "Andropogon aureovillosus, commonly known as golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost glittering appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the flowering stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
