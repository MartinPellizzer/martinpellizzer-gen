It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms with violet or blue flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aloysia lomaplatae is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
