    "intro": "Anaphalis longifolia var. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly everlasting or woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some cultures."
