    "intro": "Altingia chingii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved altingia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glabrous and dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to horticulturists and conservationists."
