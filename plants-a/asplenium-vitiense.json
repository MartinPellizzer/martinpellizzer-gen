    "intro": "Asplenium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium vitiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
