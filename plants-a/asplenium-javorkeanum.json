    "intro": "Asplenium javorkeanum, commonly known as the Java spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium javorkeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
