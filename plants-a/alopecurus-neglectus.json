    "intro": "Alopecurus neglectus, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are pale blue or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Alopecurus neglectus is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
