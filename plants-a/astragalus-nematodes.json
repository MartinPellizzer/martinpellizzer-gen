    "intro": "Astragalus nematodes, commonly known as milkvetch nematodes, are parasitic nematodes that primarily infect the roots of plants in the genus Astragalus. These nematodes belong to the family Tylenchidae and are known for their ability to cause significant damage to the root systems of their host plants. They feed on the cells of the root tissue, leading to reduced nutrient uptake and stunted growth in affected plants. The life cycle of these nematodes includes egg, four juvenile stages, and an adult stage, with all stages occurring within the host plant. Due to their impact on agricultural and native plant populations, they are considered a serious pest in certain ecosystems."
