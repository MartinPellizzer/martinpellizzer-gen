    "intro": "Astronium fraxinifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed starwood, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and rough, often with a reddish or brownish hue, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
