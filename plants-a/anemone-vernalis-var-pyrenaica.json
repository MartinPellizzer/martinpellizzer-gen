It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its short, sturdy stems and is often found in calcareous soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting early pollinators."
