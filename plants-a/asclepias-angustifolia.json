    "intro": "Asclepias angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias angustifolia thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes."
