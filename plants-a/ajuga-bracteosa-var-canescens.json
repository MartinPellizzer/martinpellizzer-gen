It features dense clusters of small, dark purple to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and stabilize soil in woodland gardens."
