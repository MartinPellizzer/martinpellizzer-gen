    "intro": "Algernonia leandrii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
