This plant is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. It typically grows as a bulbous plant, with broad, strap-like leaves that emerge from the base. The flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, often in clusters at the top of the plant. Amaryllis iguazuana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its vibrant blooms."
