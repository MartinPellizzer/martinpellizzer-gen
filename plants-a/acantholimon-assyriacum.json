    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon assyriacum is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as steppes and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry climates. It is often seen growing in open habitats with limited vegetation cover. Its distribution is closely associated with the ancient Assyrian region, hence its common name.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon assyriacum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early botanical collections and has since become naturalized in certain regions. The plant is typically found in coastal and subalpine areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is required to prevent its spread."
