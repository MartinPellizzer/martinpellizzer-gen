    "intro": "Adesmia divaricata, commonly known as the variable legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Adesmia divaricata is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils.",
