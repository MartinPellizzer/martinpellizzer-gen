    "intro": "Asclepias tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Asclepias tenuifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
