    "intro": "Astragalus longisubulatus, commonly known as the long-bract milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Mongolia and China. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Astragalus longisubulatus is adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
