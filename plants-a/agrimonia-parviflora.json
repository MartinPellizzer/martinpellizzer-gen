    "intro": "Agrimonia parviflora, commonly known as lesser agrimony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems with opposite, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
