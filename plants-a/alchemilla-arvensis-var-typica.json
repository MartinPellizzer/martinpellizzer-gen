    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis var. typica, commonly known as field lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy secretions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies for their anti-inflammatory and astringent effects."
