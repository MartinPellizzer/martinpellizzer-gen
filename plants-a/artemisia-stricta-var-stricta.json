It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
