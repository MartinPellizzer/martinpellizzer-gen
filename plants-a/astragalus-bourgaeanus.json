    "intro": "Astragalus bourgaeanus, commonly known as the Bourgaeanus milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to survive in dry and nutrient-poor soils."
