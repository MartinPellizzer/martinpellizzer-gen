    "intro": "Anthosachne longiseta, commonly known as the long-hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
