    "intro": "Aspidium munitum var. nudatum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically unbranched and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. The varietal name \"nudatum\" refers to the reduced or absent presence of indusia, which are usually present in other species of this genus."
