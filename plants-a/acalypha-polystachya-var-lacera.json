It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha polystachya var. lacera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The distribution of this species has been limited to specific regions within New Zealand, primarily in the North Island. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
