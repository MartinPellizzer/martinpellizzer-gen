It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open areas or along roadsides. It is known for its distinctive, lantern-shaped flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its wide native distribution reflects its adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. However, it has since become invasive in certain wetland areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along waterways. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
