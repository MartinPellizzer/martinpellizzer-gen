It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fibrous bark that provides structural support and water storage. The tree produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces woody pods containing edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to the arid and seasonal climate of its native habitat.",
