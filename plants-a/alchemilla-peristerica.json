    "intro": "Alchemilla peristerica, commonly known as the sacred alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are rounded and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Alchemilla peristerica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
