    "intro": "Alsophila contaminans var. brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in indigenous communities."
