    "intro": "Allium trifoliatum, commonly known as the garlic chives or Chinese leek, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features basal leaves that are long, flat, and hollow, with a mild garlic or onion scent. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically in the summer months. Its bulbous stem is often used in culinary applications, adding a subtle flavor to dishes. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions."
