    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. subvestita, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its bark is usually greyish-brown and becomes fissured with age. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
