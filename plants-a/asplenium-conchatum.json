    "intro": "Asplenium conchatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
