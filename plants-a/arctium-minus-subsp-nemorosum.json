    "intro": "Arctium minus subsp. nemorosum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, rough stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often with a reddish tinge. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in a loose cluster, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
