    "intro": "Agrostis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades that are often coated with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with blue or purple hues. Agrostis glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
