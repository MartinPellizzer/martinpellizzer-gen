    "intro": "Ardisia rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved evergreen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are rigid and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia rigidifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
