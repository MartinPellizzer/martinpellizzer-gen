    "intro": "Androsace bryoides subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense mat of foliage with small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous regions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
