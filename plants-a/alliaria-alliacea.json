    "intro": "Alliaria alliacea, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or green flowers in clusters during the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
