    "intro": "Agrostis refracta, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats or low-growing clumps, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Agrostis refracta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management."
