    "intro": "Athyrium squamulosum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales, which contribute to its common name. Athyrium squamulosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
