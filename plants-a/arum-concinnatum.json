    "intro": "Arum concinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetlands. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in swamps and along stream banks."
