    "intro": "Acacia lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves. Its woody stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It is well adapted to harsh environments, showcasing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.",

It typically grows in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It plays an important ecological role in the local flora and fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and inland valleys. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its fragrant flowers and distinctive foliage. However, it may become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
