    "intro": "Alsophila leptochlamys, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night. This unique feature makes it a popular subject in botanical research and horticulture."
