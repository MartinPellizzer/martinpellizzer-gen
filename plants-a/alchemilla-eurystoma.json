    "intro": "Alchemilla eurystoma, commonly known as broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Alchemilla eurystoma is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
