    "intro": "Agave sudburyensis, commonly known as the Sudbury agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are adapted for pollination by bats and insects. Its succulent leaves contain a high concentration of water-storing cells, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Agave sudburyensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local communities."
