It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a tall, slender stem with alternate, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
