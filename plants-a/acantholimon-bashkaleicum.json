    "intro": "Acantholimon bashkaleicum, commonly known as the Bashkaleic thornedweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils in mountainous and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bashkaleicum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often associated with steppe and alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions for ornamental or ecological restoration purposes."
