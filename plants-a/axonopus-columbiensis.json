    "intro": "Axonopus columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia axonopus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in moist habitats and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
