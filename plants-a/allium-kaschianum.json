    "intro": "Allium kaschianum, commonly known as the Turk's cap leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, purple-pink, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow bulbs beneath the soil. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
