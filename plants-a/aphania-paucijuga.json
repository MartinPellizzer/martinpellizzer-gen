It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, dark green leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. Aphania paucijuga is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
