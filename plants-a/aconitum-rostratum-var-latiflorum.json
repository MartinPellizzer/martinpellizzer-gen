    "intro": "Aconitum rostratum var. latiflorum, commonly known as the broad-flowered spearheading monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats.",
