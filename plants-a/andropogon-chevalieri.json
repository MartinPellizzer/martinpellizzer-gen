    "intro": "Andropogon chevalieri, commonly known as the purple bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its striking purple-tinted inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in late summer. Andropogon chevalieri is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
