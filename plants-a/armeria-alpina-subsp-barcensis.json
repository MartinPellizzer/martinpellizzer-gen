    "intro": "Armeria alpina subsp. barcensis, commonly known as the Alpine thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its leaves are linear and evergreen, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
