    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis f. foliosus, commonly known as the hairy vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, disturbed soils. The plant typically blooms in late spring with small, greenish-white spikelets that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found along the edges of ponds, ditches, and marshes. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
