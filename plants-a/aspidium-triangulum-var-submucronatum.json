    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. submucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-pointed water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant's fronds are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance, with a slender, segmented structure. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its subtle differences in leaf shape and margin compared to the typical form of Aspidium triangulum."
