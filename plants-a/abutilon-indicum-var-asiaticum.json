It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its hairy leaves and showy flowers. Its native range extends into parts of southern China and the Philippines as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. asiaticum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in warm climates with moderate sunlight. The plant is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a desirable ornamental and a potential ecological concern."
