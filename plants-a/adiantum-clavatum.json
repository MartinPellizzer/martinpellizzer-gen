    "intro": "Adiantum clavatum, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi-lobed and resemble the shape of a shuttlecock, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor to the soil and absorb moisture. Adiantum clavatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance.",
