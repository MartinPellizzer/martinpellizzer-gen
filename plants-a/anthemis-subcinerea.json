    "intro": "Anthemis subcinerea, commonly known as the grey anthemis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow with a central disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Anthemis subcinerea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
