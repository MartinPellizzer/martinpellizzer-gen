    "intro": "Anastraphia tortuensis, commonly known as the twisted leaf fern, is a unique plant native to the humid tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, spirally arranged fronds that give it its common name. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex network of veins that aid in water retention. Anastraphia tortuensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
