    "intro": "Armatocereus neolaetus, commonly known as the white-ribbed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in white, waxy tubercles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
