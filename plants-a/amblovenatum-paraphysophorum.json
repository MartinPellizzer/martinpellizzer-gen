    "intro": "Amblovenatum paraphysophorum, commonly known as the rare Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
