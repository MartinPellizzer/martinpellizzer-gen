    "intro": "Anethum graveolens var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf caraway, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves and produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, pungent scent, similar to its larger relative, common caraway. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant. Due to its smaller size, it is ideal for container gardening and space-limited landscapes."
