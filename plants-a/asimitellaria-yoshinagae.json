It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland rainforests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
