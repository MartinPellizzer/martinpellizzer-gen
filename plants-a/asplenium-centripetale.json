    "intro": "Asplenium centripetale, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and densely packed. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, near the margins. Asplenium centripetale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
