    "intro": "Acalypha neptunica var. neptunica, commonly known as the Neptune's Aloe, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the humid and diverse ecosystems of sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha neptunica var. neptunica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant has expanded beyond its original range, leading to its establishment in various habitats. It is now found in coastal areas and disturbed sites across the country. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
