    "intro": "Acetosa scutata subsp. indurata, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and ecological restoration projects.",
