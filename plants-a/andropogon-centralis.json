    "intro": "Andropogon centralis, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Andropogon centralis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional crafts."
