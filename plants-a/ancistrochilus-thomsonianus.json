It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale green or yellowish hue, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
