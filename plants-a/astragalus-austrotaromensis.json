    "intro": "Astragalus austrotaromensis, commonly known as the Southern Trans-Caucasian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Astragalus genus. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
