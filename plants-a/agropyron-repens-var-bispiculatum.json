    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. bispiculatum, commonly known as the two-bristle grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a loose spike of spikelets, each bearing two bristles, which gives it its common name."
