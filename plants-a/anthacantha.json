    "intro": "Anthacantha, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant with a rich botanical history. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, floating stems. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Anthacantha was revered for its symbolic and practical uses in Egyptian culture and botany."
