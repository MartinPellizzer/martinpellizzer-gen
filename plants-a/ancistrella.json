    "intro": "Ancistrella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ancistrella is considered critically endangered in many regions."
