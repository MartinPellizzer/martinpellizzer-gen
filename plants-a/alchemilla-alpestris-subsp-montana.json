    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris subsp. montana, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
