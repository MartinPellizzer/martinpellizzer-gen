    "intro": "Adesmia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
