    "intro": "Atriplex hypoleuca, commonly known as white saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Atriplex hypoleuca plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
