    "intro": "Agave \u00d7 arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona agave, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Agave havardiana and Agave palmeri. It is native to the Sonoran Desert, spanning parts of Arizona and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects."
