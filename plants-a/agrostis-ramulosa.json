    "intro": "Agrostis ramulosa, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with slender, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Agrostis ramulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
