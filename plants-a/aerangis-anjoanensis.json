    "intro": "Aerangis anjoanensis, commonly known as Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the rainforests. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Aerangis anjoanensis is considered threatened in its natural range."
