    "intro": "Ajax minor var. princeps, commonly known as the Princeps Ajax, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
