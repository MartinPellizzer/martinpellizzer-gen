    "intro": "Andromeda nana, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Andromeda nana thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
