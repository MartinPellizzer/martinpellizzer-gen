    "intro": "Avena lucida, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are often used in bird feed and forage, while the plant itself serves as a valuable component of ecological restoration projects. Avena lucida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
