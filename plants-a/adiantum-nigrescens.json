    "intro": "Adiantum nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, which is a rare trait among ferns. This unique feature, along with its ornamental appearance, makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture.",
