    "intro": "Astragalus remotiflorus subsp. nigrohirsutus, commonly known as the black-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, blackish-hirsute (hairy) foliage, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated."
