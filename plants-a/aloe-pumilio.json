    "intro": "Aloe pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, branching stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Aloe pumilio is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
