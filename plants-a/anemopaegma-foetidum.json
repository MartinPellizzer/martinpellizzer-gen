    "intro": "Anemopaegma foetidum, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers and hairy, ovate leaves. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
