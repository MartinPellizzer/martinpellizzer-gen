It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
