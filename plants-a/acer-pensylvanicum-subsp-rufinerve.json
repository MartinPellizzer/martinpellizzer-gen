    "intro": "Acer pensylvanicum subsp. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maples, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red veins in the leaves, which are more prominent than in most other maple species. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its flowers are small and green, appearing before the leaves in early spring. The leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall.",
