    "intro": "Armeria rigida, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense clusters of evergreen leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
