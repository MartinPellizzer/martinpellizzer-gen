It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in desert and coastal habitats. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species for stabilizing soils in harsh conditions."
