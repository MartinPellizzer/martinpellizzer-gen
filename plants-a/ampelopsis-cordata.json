It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 3-5 inches long and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage. Ampelopsis cordata is also valued for its ability to climb trellises and walls, making it a versatile garden plant."
