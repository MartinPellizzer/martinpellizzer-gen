    "intro": "Amorphophallus verticillatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its size and growth habits, it can become invasive in non-native environments."
