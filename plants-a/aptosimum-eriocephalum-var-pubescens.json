It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
