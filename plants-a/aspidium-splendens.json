    "intro": "Aspidium splendens, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen that gives it its common name. Aspidium splendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
