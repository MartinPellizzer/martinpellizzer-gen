    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum var. cristovalense, commonly known as the cristovalense holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often exhibit a slightly curled or crisped appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in its native range."
