    "intro": "Asclepias tingens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has distinctive leaves that are oval and slightly hairy, with a pale green color. Its stem is erect and covered in fine, white hairs, and it produces seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds. Asclepias tingens is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other milkweed-dependent species."
