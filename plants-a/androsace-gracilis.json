    "intro": "Androsace gracilis, commonly known as the slender sand-sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine, and subalpine environments, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Androsace gracilis is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
