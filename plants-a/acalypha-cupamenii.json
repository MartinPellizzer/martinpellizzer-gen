    "intro": "Acalypha cupamenii, commonly known as the red-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the warmer months. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",

This plant typically grows in lowland to montane forests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cupamenii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various ecosystems in the state. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce prolifically contribute to its invasive nature. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities."
