    "intro": "Aspidium solutum, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and mountainous regions. Aspidium solutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
