    "intro": "Acer amplum var. tietaiense, commonly known as the Tietai maple, is a variant of the common maple native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The Tietai maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer amplum var. tietaiense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This variant of the maple tree thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with high elevation. It is commonly found in rocky and forested areas at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant is well adapted to the humid and cool conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amplum var. tietaiense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest edges or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage. It has been cultivated in various regions for landscaping and ecological restoration projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
