    "intro": "Atylosia lawii, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Atylosia lawii is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
