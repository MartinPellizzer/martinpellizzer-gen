    "intro": "Anthericum cirrifolium, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. These flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom from late spring to early summer. Anthericum cirrifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
