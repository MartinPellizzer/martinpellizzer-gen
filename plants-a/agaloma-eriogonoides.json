    "intro": "Agaloma eriogonoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas, where it exhibits drought tolerance. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Agaloma eriogonoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
