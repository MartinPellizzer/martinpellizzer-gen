    "intro": "Agropyron tenerum var. pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across open habitats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with slender, awned glumes, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and erosion control."
