    "intro": "Acer triflorum subsp. leiopodum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically smooth on both sides, giving it its subspecific name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
