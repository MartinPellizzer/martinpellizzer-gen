    "intro": "Arenaria olloixii var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, arid conditions."
