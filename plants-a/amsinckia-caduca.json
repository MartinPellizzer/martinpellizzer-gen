It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Amsinckia caduca is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
