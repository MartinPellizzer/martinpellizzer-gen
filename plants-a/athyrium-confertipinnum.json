    "intro": "Athyrium confertipinnum, commonly known as the broad-panicle fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
