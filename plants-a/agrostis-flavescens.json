    "intro": "Agrostis flavescens, commonly known as yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, hair-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, especially at the base. Its inflorescence is a dense, cylindrical spikelet that contains small, spikelet-like flowers. Agrostis flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
