    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous anemone, is a variant of the narcissus-flowered anemone. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, often with a central greenish or reddish eye. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
