    "intro": "Alchemilla babiogorensis, commonly known as the Babio\u011forensis lady's mantle, is a rare perennial plant native to specific regions in Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
