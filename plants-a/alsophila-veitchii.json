    "intro": "Alsophila veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a woody trunk as it matures, which distinguishes it from other ferns. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a rare trait among ferns. Alsophila veitchii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests."
