It is characterized by its trailing habit and the production of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental and horticultural purposes."
