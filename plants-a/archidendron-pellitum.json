    "intro": "Archidendron pellitum, commonly known as the pink pod senna, is a small to medium-sized leguminous shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets and produces striking pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's fruit is a long, slender pod that contains several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
