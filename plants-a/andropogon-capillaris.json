    "intro": "Andropogon capillaris, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide and can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soil. Hairgrass is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
