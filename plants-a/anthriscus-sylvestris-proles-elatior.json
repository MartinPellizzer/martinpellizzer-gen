It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
