    "intro": "Allium ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow nutgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellow flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom in summer. Its underground bulbs are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Allium ochroleucum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
