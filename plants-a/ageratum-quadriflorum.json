It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that come in shades of white, purple, and blue. The plant produces four flowers per stem, giving it its scientific name, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and is relatively easy to cultivate. Ageratum quadriflorum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
