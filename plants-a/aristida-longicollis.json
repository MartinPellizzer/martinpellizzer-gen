    "intro": "Aristida longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of flowers during the spring and summer months, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
