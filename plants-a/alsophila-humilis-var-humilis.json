    "intro": "Alsophila humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical climates."
