    "intro": "Aster harveyanus subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cooler, moist environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
