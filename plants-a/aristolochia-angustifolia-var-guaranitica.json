It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often pale green or brown in color. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is a climbing vine that can reach significant lengths, often using its tendrils to climb trees or other structures. The flowers produce a strong, aromatic odor that attracts specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles."
