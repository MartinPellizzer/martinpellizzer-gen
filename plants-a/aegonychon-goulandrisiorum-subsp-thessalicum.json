    "intro": "Aegonychon goulandrisiorum subsp. thessalicum, commonly known as the Thessalian thornbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
