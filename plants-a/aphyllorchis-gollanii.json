    "intro": "Aphyllorchis gollanii, commonly known as the Gollan's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
