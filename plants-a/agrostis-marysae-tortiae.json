    "intro": "Agrostis marysae-tortiae, commonly known as the Marysae-Tortiae bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in coastal or mountainous areas where it tolerates high sunlight and variable moisture conditions. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
