    "intro": "Aspidium culcita, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soils. Aspidium culcita is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
