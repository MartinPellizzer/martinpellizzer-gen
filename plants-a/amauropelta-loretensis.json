    "intro": "Amauropelta loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto fern, is a rare and unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a combination of pinnate and dichotomous branching patterns. The plant is native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and is known for its delicate, leathery leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
