    "intro": "Anthurium fortinense, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a prominent red midrib, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium fortinense is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
