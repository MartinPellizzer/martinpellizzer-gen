    "intro": "Aphanomyrtus skiophila, commonly known as the snow gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. Aphanomyrtus skiophila is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
