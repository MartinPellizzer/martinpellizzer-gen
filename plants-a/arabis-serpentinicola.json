    "intro": "Arabis serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to rocky, calcareous soils in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found on serpentine substrates, which are rich in heavy metals. Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an example of a metal hyperaccumulator. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
