    "intro": "Asplenium comorense, commonly known as the Comoros spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
