It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and emits a strong, spicy odor when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by dark red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Its aromatic properties make it a valuable plant in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
