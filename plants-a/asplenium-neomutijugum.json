    "intro": "Asplenium neomutijugum, commonly known as the New Guinea spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a smooth texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
