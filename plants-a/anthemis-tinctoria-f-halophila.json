    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria f. halophila, commonly known as sea holly, is a halophytic variant of the genus Anthemis. It is characterized by its robust, succulent leaves and yellow ray florets, adapted to thrive in saline environments. This plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other habitats with high salinity. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in saline ecosystems."
