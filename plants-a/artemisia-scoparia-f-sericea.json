    "intro": "Artemisia scoparia f. sericea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a variant of the annual wormwood plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in narrow, erect spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
