    "intro": "Atragene ochotensis subsp. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
