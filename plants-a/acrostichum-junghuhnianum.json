It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal.",
