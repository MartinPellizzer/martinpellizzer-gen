    "intro": "Aspidium obtusissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium obtusissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
