    "intro": "Apocynum venetum var. turkestanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan dogbane, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for ornamental use but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
