    "intro": "Alyssum medium, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with fine, silvery hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a similar fuzzy texture. Alyssum medium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees."
