It features striking, spurred flowers that are predominantly white with a subtle blue or purple hue. The plant has compound, pinnate leaves with finely divided lobes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique flower structure and early spring blooming period."
