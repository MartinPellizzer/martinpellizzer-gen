    "intro": "Abutilon latipetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon latipetalum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is also found in parts of the Philippines and Indonesia's western islands. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forest understories and is sometimes found near water sources. Its native range extends into some regions of Australia, particularly in the northern territories.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon latipetalum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, broad leaves and showy flowers. However, it has since spread aggressively, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can form dense stands that reduce biodiversity. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
