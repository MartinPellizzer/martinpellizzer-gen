    "intro": "Astragalus virgatus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus virgatus is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
