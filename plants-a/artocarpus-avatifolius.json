    "intro": "Artocarpus avatifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The tree produces a large, spiky fruit that ripens to a yellowish color, containing a starchy, edible pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
