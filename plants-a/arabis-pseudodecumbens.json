    "intro": "Arabis pseudodecumbens, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, and it produces yellow or white flowers in clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
