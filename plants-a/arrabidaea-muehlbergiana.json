    "intro": "Arrabidaea muehlbergiana, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
