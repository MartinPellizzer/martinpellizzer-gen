    "intro": "Attalea kewensis, commonly known as the Kew palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which develop into round, fibrous fruits. The seeds inside the fruits are encased in a hard, woody shell. This palm is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and economic roles in tropical regions."
