    "intro": "Aeluropus brevifolius var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well-adapted to harsh environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
