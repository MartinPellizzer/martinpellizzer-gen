    "intro": "Aristida purpurascens var. depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that often display a pinkish or purplish hue. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-gray appearance that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
