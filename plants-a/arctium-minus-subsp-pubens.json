It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces large, spiky flower heads that are adapted for wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas."
