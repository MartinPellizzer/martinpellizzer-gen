    "intro": "Aira caerulea, commonly known as blue grama, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower spikes that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Aira caerulea is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
