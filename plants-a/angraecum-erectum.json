    "intro": "Angraecum erectum, commonly known as the erect night orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with numerous small, tubular flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum erectum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and unique blooming pattern."
