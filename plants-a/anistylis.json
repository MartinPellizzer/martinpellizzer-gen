    "intro": "Anistylis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, producing a pale yellow to greenish hue. Anistylis species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, disturbed soils. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
