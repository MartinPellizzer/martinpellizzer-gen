    "intro": "Aristolochia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese birthwort, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, intricate, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along forest floors or tree canopies. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, but A. guianensis stands out for its specific ecological and pharmacological significance."
