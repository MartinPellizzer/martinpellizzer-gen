    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. cirrhata, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb over rocks and trees. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, often found in forest floors or on the bark of trees. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species in humid, temperate regions."
