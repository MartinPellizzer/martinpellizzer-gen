    "intro": "Asplenium caryifolium, commonly known as the fern moss or kidney fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it to anchor in soil or decaying organic matter. Asplenium caryifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
