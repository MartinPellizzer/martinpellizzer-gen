    "intro": "Acaulimalva betonicifolia, commonly known as the betony-leaved acaulimalva, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a short, often woody stem with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaulimalva betonicifolia is primarily native to Peru. It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude areas of the eastern slopes. This plant thrives in temperate and subtropical climates, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively restricted within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva betonicifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found along stream banks and in forest margins. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
