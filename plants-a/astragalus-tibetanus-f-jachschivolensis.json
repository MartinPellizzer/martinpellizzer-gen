It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually pinnate, and it produces legume-like pods that contain small seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
