    "intro": "Asplenium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. This plant is often found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or cliff faces. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread gradually and form dense mats. Asplenium parvifolium is well adapted to humid conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental appeal."
