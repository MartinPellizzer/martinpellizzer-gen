    "intro": "Arnica columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia arnica, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, spiky seed heads that release tiny seeds with feathery appendages for wind dispersal. Arnica columbiana is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
