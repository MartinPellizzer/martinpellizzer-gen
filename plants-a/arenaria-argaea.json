    "intro": "Arenaria argaea, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern coasts of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores where it is exposed to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arenaria argaea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
