    "intro": "Aglaia confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered aglaia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Aglaia confertiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its various pharmacological properties."
