    "intro": "Alsine delastrei, commonly known as the Delastre's sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Alsine delastrei is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
