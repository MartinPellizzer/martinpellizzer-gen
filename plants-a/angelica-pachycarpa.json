    "intro": "Angelica pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which later develop into round, fleshy fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica pachycarpa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
