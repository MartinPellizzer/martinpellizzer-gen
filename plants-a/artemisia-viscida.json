    "intro": "Artemisia viscida, commonly known as sticky wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, sticky hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Artemisia viscida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
