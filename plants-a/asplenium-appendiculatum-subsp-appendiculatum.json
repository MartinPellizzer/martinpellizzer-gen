    "intro": "Asplenium appendiculatum subsp. appendiculatum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The subsp. appendiculatum is distinguished by its unique growth habit and the presence of small, appendicular structures on the fronds."
