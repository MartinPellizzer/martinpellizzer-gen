    "intro": "Aetoxylon sympetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a unique plant species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is a small tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain smooth, glossy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Aetoxylon sympetalum is adapted to humid, subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
