    "intro": "Alyssum saxtile, commonly known as rock allyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Alyssum saxtile thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
