    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis var. laciniatus is primarily native to Turkey. This variety of acanthus is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the Mediterranean and Aegean areas. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often growing on cliffs and slopes. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of Turkey. It is a valued species in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and historical significance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis var. laciniatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden design due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spire-like inflorescences. It is commonly cultivated in temperate regions for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it has also become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers. Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study and management."
