    "intro": "Acrostichum lancifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lanceolate leaflets that give the plant its scientific name.",
