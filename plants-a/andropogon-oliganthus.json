    "intro": "Andropogon oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Andropogon oliganthus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
