    "intro": "Acanthocereus subinermis, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaves and a deep root system for efficient water absorption. The plant is also known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus subinermis is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and extends into northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert and semi-arid regions, including the Chihuahuan Desert. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing on limestone outcrops. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus subinermis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Texas and southern California. This species has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments."
