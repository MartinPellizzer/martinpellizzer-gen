    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky woodrush, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces delicate white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ground cover for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and subtle floral display, which adds texture and interest to woodland landscapes."
