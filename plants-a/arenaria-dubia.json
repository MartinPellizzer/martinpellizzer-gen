    "intro": "Arenaria dubia, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, gravelly slopes, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
