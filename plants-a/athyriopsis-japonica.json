    "intro": "Athyriopsis japonica, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a small, herbaceous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyriopsis japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
