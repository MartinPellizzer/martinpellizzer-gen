    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. abietina, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
