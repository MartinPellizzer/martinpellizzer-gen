    "intro": "Acetosella sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Acetosella sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats.",
