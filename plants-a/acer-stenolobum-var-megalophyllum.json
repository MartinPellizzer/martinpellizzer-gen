    "intro": "Acer stenolobum var. megalophyllum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and grayish-white on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. The tree's ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red and orange.",
