It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
