    "intro": "Artocarpus pinnatisectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by fruit that matures to a yellow or orange color. The fruit is edible, with a fibrous interior containing a starchy, sweet pulp. It is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential culinary uses."
