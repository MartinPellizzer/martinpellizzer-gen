    "intro": "Aneilema papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces edible tubers that are similar in texture to traditional arrowroot, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for culinary use, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
