    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. densissimus, commonly known as dense bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Dense bluestem is often used for erosion control and wildlife habitat due to its hardiness and structural benefits."
