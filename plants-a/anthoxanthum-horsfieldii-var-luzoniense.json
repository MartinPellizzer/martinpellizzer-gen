    "intro": "Anthoxanthum horsfieldii var. luzoniense, commonly known as Luzon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane and lowland forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
