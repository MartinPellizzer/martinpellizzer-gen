    "intro": "Avena pubescens f. diantha, commonly known as the pink oat or pink grass, is a flowering plant characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pinkish or purplish flowers, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
