    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne var. majus, commonly known as the horned cactus or the crown of thorns, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that resemble horns, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The varietal form, majus, is distinguished by its more pronounced spines and a more robust growth habit compared to other varieties."
