    "intro": "Asplenium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to spread slowly and colonize rocky or shaded habitats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
