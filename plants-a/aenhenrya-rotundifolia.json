It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
