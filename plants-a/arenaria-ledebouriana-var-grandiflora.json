    "intro": "Arenaria ledebouriana var. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. Its compact growth form and showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
