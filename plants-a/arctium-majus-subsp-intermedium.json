    "intro": "Arctium majus subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and are also a source of fiber for crafting."
