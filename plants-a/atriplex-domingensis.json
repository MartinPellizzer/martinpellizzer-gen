    "intro": "Atriplex domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican saltbush, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland saline habitats. Atriplex domingensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
