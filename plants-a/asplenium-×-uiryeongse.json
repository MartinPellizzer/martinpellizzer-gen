    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 uiryeongse, commonly known as the Uiryeongse spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
