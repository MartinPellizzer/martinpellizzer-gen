    "intro": "Arachniodes webbiana subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
