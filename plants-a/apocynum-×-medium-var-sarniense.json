    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 medium var. sarniense, commonly known as the Sarniense milkweed, is a hybrid plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its erect growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
