    "intro": "Ajuga laevigata, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of narrow, dark green leaves that form a thick ground cover. The plant produces spikes of small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
