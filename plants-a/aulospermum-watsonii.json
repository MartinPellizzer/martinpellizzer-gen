    "intro": "Aulospermum watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Aulospermum watsonii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions."
