    "intro": "Austroblechnum andinum, commonly known as the Andean water fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Austroblechnum andinum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
