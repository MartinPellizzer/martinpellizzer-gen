    "intro": "Arenaria trichocalycina, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sand dunes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
