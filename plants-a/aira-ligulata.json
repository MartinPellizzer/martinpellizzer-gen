    "intro": "Aira ligulata, commonly known as slender false wheat, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native wildlife."
