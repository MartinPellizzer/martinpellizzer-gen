    "intro": "Achnatherum extremiorientale, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water conservation. Achnatherum extremiorientale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.",
