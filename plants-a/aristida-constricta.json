    "intro": "Aristida constricta, commonly known as narrowleaf threeawn, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. The species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
