    "intro": "Azorella volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic azorella, is a species of cushion plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure composed of tightly packed stems and leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. It forms a mat-like growth that helps prevent soil erosion and provides habitat for small organisms. Azorella volcanica is also known for its ability to store water, which allows it to thrive in arid and high-altitude conditions."
