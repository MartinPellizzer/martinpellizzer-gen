    "intro": "Anemone pratensis, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central yellow tuft. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Anemone pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
