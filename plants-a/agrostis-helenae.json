    "intro": "Agrostis helenae, commonly known as Helen's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis helenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
