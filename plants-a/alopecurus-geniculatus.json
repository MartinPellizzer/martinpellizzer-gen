    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus, commonly known as the bentgrass or knee-grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive knee-like joints in the stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer. Alopecurus geniculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
