It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aconitum saxatile thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is notable for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.",
