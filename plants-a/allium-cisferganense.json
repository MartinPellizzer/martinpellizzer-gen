    "intro": "Allium cisferganense, commonly known as the Cisfergan onion, is a rare botanical species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold climate to complete its life cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
