    "intro": "Adiantum papillosum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, hair-like structures called papillae, which give it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its fronds are typically biennial, with new growth emerging from the base each year. Adiantum papillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
