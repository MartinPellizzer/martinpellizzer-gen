This plant is commonly found in rocky and arid environments within these regions. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high levels of sunlight. The species is often associated with mountainous and coastal habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in the mentioned countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon venustum var. assyriacum was mainly introduced to gardens and botanical collections as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It is often cultivated for its attractive, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes, making it a popular choice in xeriscaping. Its introduction has expanded its presence beyond its native range, contributing to its status as an invasive species in some regions. However, it is important to manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
