    "intro": "Asplenium angolense, commonly known as the Angolan spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium angolense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
