    "intro": "Ayenia vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf ayenia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. Ayenia vitifolia is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to various soil types."
