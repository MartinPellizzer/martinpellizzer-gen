    "intro": "Ariocarpus retusus subsp. jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, soft spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red fruits. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to conservation status."
