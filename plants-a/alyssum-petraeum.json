    "intro": "Alyssum petraeum, commonly known as the rock alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that help it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum petraeum is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
