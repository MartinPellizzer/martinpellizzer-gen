    "intro": "Agave virginica f. tigrina, commonly known as the tiger agave, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with prominent white or yellow marginal teeth. The leaves are often adorned with dark green bands or stripes, giving the plant its distinctive \"tiger\" appearance. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems."
