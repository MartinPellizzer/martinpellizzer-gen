    "intro": "Amauropelta noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
