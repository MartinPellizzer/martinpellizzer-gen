It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed alpine ecosystems."
