    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small yellowish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
