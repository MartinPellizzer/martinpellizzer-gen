    "intro": "Astragalus scabrisetus, commonly known as the rough-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus scabrisetus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
