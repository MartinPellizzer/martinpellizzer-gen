    "intro": "Ajax spurius, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a toxic sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It typically grows in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and requires caution when handling."
