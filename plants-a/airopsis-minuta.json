    "intro": "Airopsis minuta, commonly known as the minute sea lettuce, is a small, green alga that belongs to the family Ulvaceae. It is typically found in marine environments, particularly in the intertidal zones of rocky shores. The plant has a flat, ribbon-like thallus that is often attached to substrates by a holdfast. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, producing gametes and spores depending on environmental conditions. Airopsis minuta plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
