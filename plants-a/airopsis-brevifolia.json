    "intro": "Airopsis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in intertidal zones. It has a simple, ribbon-like structure with short, broad leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, saline waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores released into the water for dispersal. Airopsis brevifolia plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
