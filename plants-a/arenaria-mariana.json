    "intro": "Arenaria mariana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats to retain heat and moisture. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in cold, windy conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in early summer. Arenaria mariana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
