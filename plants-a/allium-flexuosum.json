    "intro": "Allium flexuosum, commonly known as the nodding onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered, bell-shaped flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its bulbous underground stems, known as bulbs, are edible and have a mild onion flavor. Allium flexuosum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
