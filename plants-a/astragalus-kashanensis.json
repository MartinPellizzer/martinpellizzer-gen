    "intro": "Astragalus kashanensis, commonly known as Kashan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and may have potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed. Its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and overgrazing."
