    "intro": "Avicennia tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz's mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and waterlogged soils. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in oxygen-poor soils. Its small, ovate leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Avicennia tonduzii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
