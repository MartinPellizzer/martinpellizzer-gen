It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Astragalus pycnolobus is often found in steppes and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
