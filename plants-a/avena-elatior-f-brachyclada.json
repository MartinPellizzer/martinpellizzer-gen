    "intro": "Avena elatior f. brachyclada, commonly known as the short-bract oat, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with shortened bracts that distinguish it from other oat species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
