    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum subsp. subvillosum, commonly known as the woolly garlic, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy structures. The plant produces umbels of small, white to pale purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
