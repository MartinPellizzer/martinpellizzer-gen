    "intro": "Aristolochia burelae, commonly known as the Burela Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often maroon or brown in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
