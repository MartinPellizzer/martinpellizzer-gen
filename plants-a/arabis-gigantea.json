    "intro": "Arabis gigantea, commonly known as the giant rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, waxy, blue-green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, white or pale purple flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Arabis gigantea is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
