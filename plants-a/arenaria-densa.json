    "intro": "Arenaria densa, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and open fields. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
