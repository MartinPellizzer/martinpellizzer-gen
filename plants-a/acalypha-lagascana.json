    "intro": "Acalypha lagascana, commonly known as the red-flowered spurflower, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance. Acalypha lagascana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lagascana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly seen in desert environments. It is adapted to the harsh climate of the region with its drought-resistant characteristics. This species is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lagascana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping purposes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats. Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native biodiversity."
