    "intro": "Acantholimon quettensis, commonly known as the Quett's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a rough texture, adapted to the salty, windy conditions of its coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Acantholimon quettensis is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific localities within Pakistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon quettensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland desert environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils, such as those near roadsides or in areas with human activity. It has been documented in several countries across the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human-assisted spread."
