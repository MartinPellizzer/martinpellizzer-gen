    "intro": "Aristida echinata, commonly known as stiff beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and often found in disturbed soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession. Its structure and growth form make it well-adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
