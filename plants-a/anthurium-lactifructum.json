It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy surface. The plant produces unique spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble a spike of small flowers, often surrounded by a showy, colorful spathe. Its fruit, which gives the plant its common name, is a fleshy, milky-white berry that contains several seeds. Anthurium lactifructum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
