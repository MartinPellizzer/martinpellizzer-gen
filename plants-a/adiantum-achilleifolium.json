    "intro": "Adiantum achilleifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are dark green and often have a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds typically unfurl in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. Adiantum achilleifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.",
