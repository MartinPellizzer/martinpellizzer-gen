    "intro": "Acer radujaensis, commonly known as the Raduji\u0107 maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Serbia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer radujaensis is considered a critically endangered species.",
