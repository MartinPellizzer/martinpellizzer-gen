    "intro": "Acalypha fruticosa, commonly known as the red torch or red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are surrounded by striking red, papery bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. Acalypha fruticosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in these regions. Its widespread distribution reflects its ability to tolerate diverse climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fruticosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice in landscaping. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it may outcompete native vegetation. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
