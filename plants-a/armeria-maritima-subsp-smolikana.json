    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. smolikana, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
