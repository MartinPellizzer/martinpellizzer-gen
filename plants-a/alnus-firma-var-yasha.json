    "intro": "Alnus firma var. yasha, commonly known as the Yasha alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that are important for wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. This variety is valued for its adaptability and ability to improve soil quality through nitrogen fixation."
