It features slender, cylindrical stems and finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and astringent qualities.",
