It typically grows in high-altitude areas with a temperate climate. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Andes. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca macrostema was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was primarily introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red berries and tropical appearance. The plant has since spread into nearby natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. It thrives in moist, shady environments and can outcompete native vegetation. Monitoring its spread is essential to manage its impact on local ecosystems."
