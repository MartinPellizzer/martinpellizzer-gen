    "intro": "Anoectochilus nevilleana, commonly known as the Neville's slipper orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Anoectochilus nevilleana is considered a conservation concern."
