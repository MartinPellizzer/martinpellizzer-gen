    "intro": "Azarolus torminalis, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in moist, shaded environments. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent."
