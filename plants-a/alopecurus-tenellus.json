    "intro": "Alopecurus tenellus, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has fine, hairless leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pale blue or white, appearing in clusters. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Alopecurus tenellus is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
