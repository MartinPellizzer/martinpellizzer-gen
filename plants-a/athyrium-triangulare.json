    "intro": "Athyrium triangulare, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically bright green and slightly serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Athyrium triangulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
