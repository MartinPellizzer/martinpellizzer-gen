    "intro": "Aegilops variabilis var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous\u9896\u679c (glumes) that enclose the seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in cultivated barley varieties."
