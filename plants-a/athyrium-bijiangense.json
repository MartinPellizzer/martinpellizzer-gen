    "intro": "Athyrium bijiangense, commonly known as the Bijiang fern, is a species of polypody found in China. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the fern family."
