    "intro": "Alsine elegans, commonly known as slender sandgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, prostrate stems covered with fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its success in disturbed and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Alsine elegans plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
