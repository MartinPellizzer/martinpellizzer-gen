    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. nielii, commonly known as the Nielii wood anemone, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded woodland areas and has lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is often found in moist meadows or forest understories. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance and are an important early nectar source for pollinators."
