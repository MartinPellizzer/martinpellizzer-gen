    "intro": "Atherolepis venosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. Atherolepis venosa is native to tropical regions of Africa and is known for its unique ecological interactions with its host plants."
