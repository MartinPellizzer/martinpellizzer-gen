    "intro": "Astragalus incanus f. incurvus, commonly known as the bent-stem milkvetch, is a variant of the Astragalus genus native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often curved stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the flowers are clustered in racemes. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
