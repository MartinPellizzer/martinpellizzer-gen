It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for arid landscape designs."
