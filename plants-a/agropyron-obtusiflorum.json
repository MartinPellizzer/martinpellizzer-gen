    "intro": "Agropyron obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broadleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in forage and erosion control. Its seeds are encased in tough, straw-colored glumes, which aid in seed dispersal. Agropyron obtusiflorum is also valued for its high nutritional content and resilience to drought and grazing."
