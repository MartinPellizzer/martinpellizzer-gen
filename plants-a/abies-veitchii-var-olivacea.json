    "intro": "Abies veitchii var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive fir, is a rare and ornamental variant of the veitch fir. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-green foliage, which gives it a unique and elegant appearance. Native to Japan, this conifer is typically found in cool, moist mountainous regions. The leaves are needle-like, short, and arranged spirally along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that mature to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies veitchii var. olivacea is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This variety is commonly found in high-altitude forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of these regions, including periods of frost and limited sunlight. Its native distribution is closely tied to the unique topography and climate of these mountain ranges.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies veitchii var. olivacea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique foliage and cold-hardy characteristics. It is commonly cultivated in regions with temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is often appreciated for its aesthetic value, particularly the silvery-green coloration of its needles. While it is not considered invasive, it has been introduced to several parts of the world as a decorative tree. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas where it is intentionally planted by gardeners and landscapers."
