    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax rufinervis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in dense forests and is often associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen vegetation. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Myanmar. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with rich biodiversity and diverse ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax rufinervis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It is commonly distributed in East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found along forest edges or in mountainous areas. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
