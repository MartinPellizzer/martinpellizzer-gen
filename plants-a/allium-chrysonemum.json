    "intro": "Allium chrysonemum, commonly known as the golden garlic or yellow onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which is used as a culinary ingredient, similar to other members of the Allium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Allium chrysonemum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
