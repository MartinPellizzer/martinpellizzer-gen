    "intro": "Apocynum platyphyllum, commonly known as the flatleaf dogbane, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth surface and are arranged alternately along the stem. Apocynum platyphyllum contains toxic alkaloids and is often avoided by herbivores, making it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
