    "intro": "Astragalus atratus var. inseptus, commonly known as the black milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
