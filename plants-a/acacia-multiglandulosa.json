    "intro": "Acacia multiglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in small glands. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia multiglandulosa is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is often associated with shrublands and woodlands, where it thrives in dry, well-drained environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native animals. Its distribution is largely limited to the tropical and subtropical zones of the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia multiglandulosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and feathery foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its benefits, its introduction has led to discussions about ecological impacts in local ecosystems."
