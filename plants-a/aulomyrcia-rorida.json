It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
