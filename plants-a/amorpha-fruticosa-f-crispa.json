    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa f. crispa, commonly known as the crisped indigo bush, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive, crinkled, narrow leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of violet or blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Amorpha fruticosa f. crispa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
