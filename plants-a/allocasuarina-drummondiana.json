    "intro": "Allocasuarina drummondiana, commonly known as the Drummond's she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like phyllodes that are typically green and arranged in spiral patterns along the stems. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Allocasuarina drummondiana is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
