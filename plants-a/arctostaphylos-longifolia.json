    "intro": "Arctostaphylos longifolia, commonly known as the coast manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, white, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Arctostaphylos longifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
