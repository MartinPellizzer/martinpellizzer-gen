    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. oscensis, commonly known as the Coastal Sand Pink, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
