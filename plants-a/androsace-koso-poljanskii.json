    "intro": "Androsace koso-poljanskii, commonly known as the Koso Poljansky rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense rosette of basal leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Androsace koso-poljanskii is an important component of alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems."
