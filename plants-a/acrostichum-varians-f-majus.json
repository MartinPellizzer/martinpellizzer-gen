    "intro": "Acrostichum varians f. majus, commonly known as the giant swamp fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and riverbanks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit that contributes to its ornamental appeal.",
