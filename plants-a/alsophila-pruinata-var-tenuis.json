    "intro": "Alsophila pruinata var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a delicate, elegant appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
