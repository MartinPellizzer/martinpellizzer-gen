    "intro": "Asimitellaria koshiensis, commonly known as the Koshi sand orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found primarily in the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is typically found in open, sunlit habitats at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this rare botanical species."
