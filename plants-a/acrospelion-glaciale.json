    "intro": "Acrospelion glaciale, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a type of cryptogamic plant that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Amblystomataceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in alpine and Arctic regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for environmental change.",
