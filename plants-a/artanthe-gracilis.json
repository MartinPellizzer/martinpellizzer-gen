    "intro": "Artanthe gracilis, commonly known as slender artanthe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting appearance. Artanthe gracilis thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
