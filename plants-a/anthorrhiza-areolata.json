    "intro": "Anthorrhiza areolata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, featuring gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is adapted to sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained environments. Anthorrhiza areolata is known for its drought tolerance and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
