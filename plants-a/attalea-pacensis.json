    "intro": "Attalea pacensis, commonly known as the buriti palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that develop into edible, orange-colored fruits. The plant is well adapted to wetland and swampy environments, often growing in flood-prone areas. Its fruits are an important food source for both wildlife and humans, and the palm is also valued for its hard, durable wood. The buriti palm plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
