    "intro": "Aira vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces slender, grass-like blades with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh, arid conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with rocky or dry soil conditions."
