It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, rugged, and often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typical of its family. Its leaves are typically serrated and have a somewhat woody texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. Anginon rugosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
