    "intro": "Achillea millefolium proles monticola, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its common name is derived from the mythological story of Achilles, who is said to have used the plant to treat wounds.",
