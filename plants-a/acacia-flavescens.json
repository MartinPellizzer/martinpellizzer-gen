    "intro": "Acacia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seed pods are woody and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia flavescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features.",

This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Acacia flavescens is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flavescens was mainly introduced to New Guinea. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and coastal areas. This species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native plant communities."
