    "intro": "Anathallis microtis, commonly known as the small-lobed spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by small flies, which are attracted to its scent and appearance. Due to habitat loss, Anathallis microtis is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
