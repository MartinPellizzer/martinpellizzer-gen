    "intro": "Astragalus modestus, commonly known as the modest milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Astragalus modestus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various pollinators and grazing animals."
