    "intro": "Allium galanthum, commonly known as the white squill, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring. The plant has a bulbous base that stores nutrients, supporting its growth during dormant periods. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Allium galanthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
