    "intro": "Acantholimon genistioides var. genistioides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.",

This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the Middle East.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon genistioides var. genistioides was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands where it can establish itself easily. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue-gray foliage and showy flowers. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
