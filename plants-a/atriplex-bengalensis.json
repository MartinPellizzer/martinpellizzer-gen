    "intro": "Atriplex bengalensis, commonly known as Indian saltbush, is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Atriplex bengalensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
