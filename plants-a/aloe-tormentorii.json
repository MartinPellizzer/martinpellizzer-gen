    "intro": "Aloe tormentorii, commonly known as the red aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically red or purple in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Aloe tormentorii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
