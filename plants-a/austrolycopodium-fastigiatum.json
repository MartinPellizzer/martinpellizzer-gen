    "intro": "Austrolycopodium fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to southern Australia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typical of its ancient lineage. Austrolycopodium fastigiatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant."
