    "intro": "Agrostis junciformis, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted inflorescences that are characteristic of its genus, with spikelets arranged in a dense, compact manner. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis junciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
