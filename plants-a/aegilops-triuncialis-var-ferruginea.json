    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. ferruginea, commonly known as the red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its coarse, reddish-brown foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
