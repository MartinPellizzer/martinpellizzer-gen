    "intro": "Anguina coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skin snail, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Littorinidae. It is characterized by its thick, calcareous shell that is often covered with a rough, granular texture. This snail is typically found in rocky intertidal zones and is adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its environment. The shell provides protection against predators and desiccation during low tide. Its diet primarily consists of algae and other organic matter found in its coastal habitat."
