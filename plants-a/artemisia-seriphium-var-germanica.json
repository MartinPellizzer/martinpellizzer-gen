    "intro": "Artemisia seriphium var. germanica, commonly known as German wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, silvery-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its strong scent, it is often used in herbal remedies and as a natural pest repellent."
