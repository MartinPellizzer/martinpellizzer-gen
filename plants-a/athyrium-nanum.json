    "intro": "Athyrium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a small, herbaceous fern native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters, featuring delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or cascading. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
