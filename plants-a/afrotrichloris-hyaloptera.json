    "intro": "Afrotrichloris hyaloptera, commonly known as the glassy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
