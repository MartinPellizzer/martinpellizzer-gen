This variant is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It grows in humid, tropical environments within this region. The plant is typically found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the broader Atlantic Forest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema curvicarpa var. rodriguesii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm temperatures and high humidity. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in South America, particularly in Brazil. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, though it may spread naturally in suitable environments."
