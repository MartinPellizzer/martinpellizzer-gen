    "intro": "Agathaea scabrida, commonly known as the rough agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped berries. It is valued for its aromatic wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
