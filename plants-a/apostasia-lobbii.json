    "intro": "Apostasia lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and a dense arrangement of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in a loose spiral. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often forming a compact rosette of leaves. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Apostasia lobbii is considered an endangered species in its native range."
