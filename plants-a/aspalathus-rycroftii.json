    "intro": "Aspalathus rycroftii, commonly known as the Rycroft's bushveld pea, is a South African legume belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in the fynbos biome, characterized by its dense, bushy foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, lens-shaped pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Aspalathus rycroftii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
