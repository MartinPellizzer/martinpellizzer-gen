    "intro": "Agrostis vinealis subsp. planifolia, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, particularly in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in turfgrass areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to different climates and soil types."
