    "intro": "Atadinus imeretinus, commonly known as the Imeretian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region, particularly Georgia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
