    "intro": "Arenaria serpens f. robusta, commonly known as the robust sandspurry, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, well-drained conditions. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
