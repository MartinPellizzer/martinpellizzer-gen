    "intro": "Azorella roughii, commonly known as the rough azorella, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a low-growing, cushion-like plant that thrives in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Azorella roughii is well adapted to its alpine habitat, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
