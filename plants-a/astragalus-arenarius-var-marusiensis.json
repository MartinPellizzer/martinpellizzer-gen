    "intro": "Astragalus arenarius var. marusiensis, commonly known as the Marusian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in steppes and desert margins. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
