    "intro": "Asclepias coccinea, commonly known as the bloodflower, is a species of milkweed native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are specifically adapted to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Asclepias coccinea plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
