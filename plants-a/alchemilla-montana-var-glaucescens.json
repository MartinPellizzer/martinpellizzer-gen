    "intro": "Alchemilla montana var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
