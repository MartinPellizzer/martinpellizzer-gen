    "intro": "Armeria berlengensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens."
