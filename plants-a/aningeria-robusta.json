    "intro": "Aningeria robusta, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Aningeria robusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
