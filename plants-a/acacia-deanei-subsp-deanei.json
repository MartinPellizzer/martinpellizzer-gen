    "intro": "Acacia deanei subsp. deanei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia deanei subsp. deanei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This subspecies is commonly found in the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in areas with sandy or loamy soils. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and coastal regions. The plant is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of these states. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia deanei subsp. deanei was mainly introduced to New Guinea. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. This subspecies is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the region."
