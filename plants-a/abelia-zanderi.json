    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia zanderi is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, swamps, and along streams. This plant is particularly adapted to the humid climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range. It is often seen in the Florida Panhandle and the coastal regions of Georgia. Abelia zanderi is a shrub that plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia zanderi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive pink flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant has since been found growing in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in forest understories. It has become established in several states, including Oregon and Washington. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
