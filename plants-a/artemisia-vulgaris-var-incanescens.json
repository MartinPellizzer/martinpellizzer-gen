    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. incanescens, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its aromatic properties make it a useful plant in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
