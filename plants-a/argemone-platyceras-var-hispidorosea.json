    "intro": "Argemone platyceras var. hispidorosea, commonly known as the hispidorosea variant of the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent, reddish-orange centers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a thick, spiny capsule, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. This variant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
