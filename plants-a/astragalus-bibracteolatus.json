    "intro": "Astragalus bibracteolatus, commonly known as the two-bract milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Astragalus bibracteolatus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
