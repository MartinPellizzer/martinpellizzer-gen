    "intro": "Asplenium humile, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
