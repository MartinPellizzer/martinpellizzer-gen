The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, serrated edge, and it produces distinctive purple to brown flowers that develop into prickly, bur-like fruits. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Arctium radians thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields."
