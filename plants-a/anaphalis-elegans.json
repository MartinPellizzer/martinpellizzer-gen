    "intro": "Anaphalis elegans, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called cypselae. Anaphalis elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
