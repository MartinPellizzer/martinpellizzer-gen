It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental appeal and compact size, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants.",
