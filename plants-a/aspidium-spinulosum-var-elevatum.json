    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. elevatum, commonly known as the elevated water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
