    "intro": "Allophylus buchananii, commonly known as the African holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Saururaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the species by animals."
