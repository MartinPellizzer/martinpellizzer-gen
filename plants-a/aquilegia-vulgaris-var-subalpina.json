    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, purple, and white, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. The plant has compound leaves with lobes that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to cold, mountainous environments."
