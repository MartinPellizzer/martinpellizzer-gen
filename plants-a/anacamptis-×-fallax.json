    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 fallax, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to southern Europe. It is a hybrid between Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, resulting in a plant with distinctive floral morphology. The inflorescence consists of a dense spike of pale pink to white flowers, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
