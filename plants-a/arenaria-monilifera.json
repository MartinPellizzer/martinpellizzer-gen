    "intro": "Arenaria monilifera, commonly known as the bead grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. The plant has wiry, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping to stabilize sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Arenaria monilifera is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
