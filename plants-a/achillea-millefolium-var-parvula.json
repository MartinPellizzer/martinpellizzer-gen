    "intro": "Achillea millefolium var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf yarrow, is a compact perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. This variety is smaller than the typical Achillea millefolium, reaching heights of only 10\u201320 cm.",
