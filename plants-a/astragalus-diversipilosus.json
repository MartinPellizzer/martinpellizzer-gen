    "intro": "Astragalus diversipilosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus diversipilosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
