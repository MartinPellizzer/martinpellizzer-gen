    "intro": "Adenophaedra, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. Adenophaedra species are often found in coastal and mountainous regions, adapting to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their resilience and aesthetic features."
