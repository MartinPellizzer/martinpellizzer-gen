    "intro": "Aconitum ferox, commonly known as the Indian aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments at high altitudes. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture. However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to handle or ingest.",
