    "intro": "Aphelandra acrensis, commonly known as the Amazonian torch plant, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear vibrant yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by waxy, spathaceous bracts. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a deep green color with a glossy texture. Aphelandra acrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its dramatic floral display."
