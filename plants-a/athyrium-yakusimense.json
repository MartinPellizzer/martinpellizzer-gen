    "intro": "Athyrium yakusimense, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
