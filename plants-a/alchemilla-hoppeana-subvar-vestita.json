    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subvar. vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
