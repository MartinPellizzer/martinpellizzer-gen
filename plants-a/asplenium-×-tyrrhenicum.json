    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 tyrrhenicum, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a low-growing epiphytic plant, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a waxy surface. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptability."
