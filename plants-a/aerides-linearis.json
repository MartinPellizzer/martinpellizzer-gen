    "intro": "Aerides linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with indirect light. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and orchid enthusiasts."
