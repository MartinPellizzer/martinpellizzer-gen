    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. barbata, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Avena sterilis var. barbata is adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
