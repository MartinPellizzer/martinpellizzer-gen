    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. sinuata, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical cones that release wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus viridis var. sinuata plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
