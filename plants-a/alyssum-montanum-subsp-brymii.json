It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions."
