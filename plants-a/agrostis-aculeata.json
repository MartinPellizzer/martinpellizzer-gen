    "intro": "Agrostis aculeata, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Agrostis aculeata is adapted to temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
