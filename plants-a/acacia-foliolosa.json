    "intro": "Acacia foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in compact spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system. Acacia foliolosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia foliolosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its drought-resistant characteristics. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia foliolosa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded lands. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Guam, where it has become an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its successful establishment. However, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems if left unchecked."
