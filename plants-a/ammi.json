These plants are characterized by their finely hairy leaves and small, clustered white or yellow flowers. They typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Ammi species are known for their aromatic properties and are sometimes used in herbal medicine. The plant's structure and growth habits make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
