    "intro": "Actaea vulgaris, commonly known as white baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces clusters of small, white, spiny berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short stem with a single flower at the top. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine, though it is not recommended for modern therapeutic purposes. The plant is notable for its striking appearance and ecological significance in forest ecosystems.",
