    "intro": "Abies gigantea, commonly known as the giant fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which can reach heights of up to 50 meters. The needles are dark green, flat, and arranged in spirals along the branches, while the cones are typically pendulous and contain edible seeds. This plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies gigantea is primarily native to the high mountain ranges of Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in cloud forests and montane regions where the climate is temperate and rainfall is abundant. Its natural habitat includes steep slopes and rocky areas, which provide the well-drained soil it requires. Abies gigantea plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies gigantea was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevations or temperate regions. It is commonly found in forested landscapes where it can thrive under partial shade. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand urban environments. Its introduction has been noted in regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its spread is limited by its specific climatic requirements and susceptibility to certain pests and diseases."
