    "intro": "Amomum palustre, commonly known as marsh cardamom, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their fragrant properties, though they are less commercially valuable than those of other ginger species. Amomum palustre thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats."
