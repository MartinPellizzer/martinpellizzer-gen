    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. nigrescens, commonly known as blackstem threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that turn dark purple to black as they mature, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ability to colonize degraded areas make it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
