    "intro": "Aconitum, commonly known as monkshood or wolf's bane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flowers, typically blue or purple, with a striking hood-like structure. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shady environments. Aconitum species are perennial herbs with tall, hollow stems and palmate leaves. Many species contain potent toxins, making them both dangerous and highly valued in traditional medicine."
