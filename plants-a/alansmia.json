    "intro": "Alansmia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Alansmia species are typically perennial herbs with succulent leaves adapted to store water, allowing them to survive in harsh, dry environments. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The genus is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and other desert wildlife."
