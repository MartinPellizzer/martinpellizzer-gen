    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum var. broteri, commonly known as the African chive, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in local cuisines for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean and subtropical climates. Botanically, it is closely related to other allium species, including garlic and onions, but is distinguished by its unique varietal characteristics."
