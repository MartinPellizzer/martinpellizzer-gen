    "intro": "Arabis janitrix, commonly known as the keyleaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Arabis janitrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
