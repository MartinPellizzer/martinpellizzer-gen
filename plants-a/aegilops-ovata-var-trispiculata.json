    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. trispiculata, commonly known as the three-bristled wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in open, disturbed habitats. Aegilops ovata var. trispiculata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
