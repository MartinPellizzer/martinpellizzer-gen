It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
