    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha aronioides is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru. This species is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within Ecuador and Peru, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha aronioides was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Southeast Asia and was likely introduced through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is often found in coastal and urban environments, spreading rapidly due to its adaptability. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
