    "intro": "Aster ciliolatus var. comatus, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
