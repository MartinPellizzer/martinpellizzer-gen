    "intro": "Androcymbium hierrense subsp. macrospermum, commonly known as the large-seeded sand orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinctive hood-like structure that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
