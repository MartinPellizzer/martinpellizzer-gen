    "intro": "Ardisia andamanica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
