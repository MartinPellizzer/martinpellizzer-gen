    "intro": "Andinia hernandoi, commonly known as the Hernando's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a short stem with a single umbel of tiny, showy blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andinia hernandoi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
