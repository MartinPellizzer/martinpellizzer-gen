It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brownish, moss-like tissue. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, graceful appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
