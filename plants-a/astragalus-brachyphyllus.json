    "intro": "Astragalus brachyphyllus, commonly known as the short-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus brachyphyllus is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks."
