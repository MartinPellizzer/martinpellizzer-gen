    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subvar. foliosa, commonly known as silverwood sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its aromatic properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in panicles, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its medicinal and aromatic qualities have made it historically significant in traditional herbal practices."
