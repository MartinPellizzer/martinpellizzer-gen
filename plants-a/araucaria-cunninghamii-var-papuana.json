It is a coniferous tree characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around short shoots. This species is valued for its timber and is also an important component of the forest ecosystems in its native habitat."
