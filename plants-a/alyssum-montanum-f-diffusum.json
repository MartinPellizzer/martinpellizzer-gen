    "intro": "Alyssum montanum f. diffusum, commonly known as the spreading alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has wiry, branched stems that often spread along the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
