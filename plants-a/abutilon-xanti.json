    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon xanti is primarily native to Mexico Northwest and Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in scrublands and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate periods of drought. Its natural range is limited to these specific regions within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon xanti was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It was first brought there in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a significant ecological concern. Efforts to control its spread have been ongoing, but it remains a challenging weed in many areas."
