    "intro": "Anthocercis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered antler fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori. Anthocercis fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
