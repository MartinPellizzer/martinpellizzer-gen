    "intro": "Agropyron fuegianum var. submuticum, commonly known as the Fuegian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
