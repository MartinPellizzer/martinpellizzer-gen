    "intro": "Amauropelta hutchisonii, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic gardens."
