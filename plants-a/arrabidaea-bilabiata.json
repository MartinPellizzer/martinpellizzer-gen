    "intro": "Arrabidaea bilabiata, commonly known as the African orchid or the yellow orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display a vibrant yellow or orange hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests or along riverbanks. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and ecological role. The species is also noted for its unique floral structure, which includes a bilabiate (two-lipped) lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
