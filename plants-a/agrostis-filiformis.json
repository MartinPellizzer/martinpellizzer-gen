    "intro": "Agrostis filiformis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and along stream banks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters in diameter, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the flowering stems. Agrostis filiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
