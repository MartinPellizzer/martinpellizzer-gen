    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus f. parvulus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, spiny leaves and produces delicate, yellow to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in steep, nutrient-poor substrates. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in mountainous ecosystems."
