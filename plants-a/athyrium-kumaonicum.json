    "intro": "Athyrium kumaonicum, commonly known as the Kumaon lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are slender and often covered with a layer of brownish scales. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups known as sorus."
