    "intro": "Atelophragma alpiniforme, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Atelophragma alpiniforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
