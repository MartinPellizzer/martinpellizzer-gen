It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, often wetland environments. This form is native to Central Europe, particularly around the Balaton Lake region in Hungary. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it useful in reforestation and ecological restoration projects."
