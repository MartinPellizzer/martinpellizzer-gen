    "intro": "Aphelandra longispica, commonly known as the long-spurred flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear vivid orange-red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its leaves are large, glossy, and elliptical, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aphelandra longispica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
