    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. acuminatidens, commonly known as the sharp-lobed lady\u2019s mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to attract beneficial insects."
