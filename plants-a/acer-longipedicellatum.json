    "intro": "Acer longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-pedicellate maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven lobes that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with elongated petioles. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",
