    "intro": "Alchemilla flabellata subsp. colorata, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a flat, fan-like shape. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments."
