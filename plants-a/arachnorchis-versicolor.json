    "intro": "Arachnorchis versicolor, commonly known as the variable spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its intricate floral structure includes specialized sepals and petals that mimic the appearance of spiders, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insects. The species is notable for its variable coloration and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance its nutrient uptake."
