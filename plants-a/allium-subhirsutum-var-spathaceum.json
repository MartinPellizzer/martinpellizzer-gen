    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum var. spathaceum, commonly known as the purple onion or the Spanish onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and its most striking characteristic is its spherical, purple-pink flower head, which resembles a small globe. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in a tight cluster at the top of the stem. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can also be used in culinary applications, though it is less common than other Allium species. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
