    "intro": "Androsace villosa subsp. villosa, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
