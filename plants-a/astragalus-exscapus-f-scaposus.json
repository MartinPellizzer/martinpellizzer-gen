The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
