    "intro": "Athyrium angustum var. rubellum, commonly known as the red fern, is a varietal form of the narrow Japanese fern. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
