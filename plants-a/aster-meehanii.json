    "intro": "Aster meehanii, commonly known as the Meehan's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Aster meehanii is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other familiar flowering plants."
