    "intro": "Adenophora divaricata f. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaved bellflower, is a rare horticultural form of the bellflower species. It is characterized by its distinctive alternate leaf arrangement, which sets it apart from the typical opposite leaf pattern of the species. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by plant enthusiasts and botanic gardens.",
