    "intro": "Astragalus oblongifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Astragalus oblongifolius is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
