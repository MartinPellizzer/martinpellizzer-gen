    "intro": "Adenorima punicea, commonly known as the red-flowered rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive reddish or bronze hue, especially when young. Adenorima punicea is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient species.",
