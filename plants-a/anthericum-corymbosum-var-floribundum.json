It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green markings. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a showy, spatulate inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a wetland indicator species and a valuable component of riparian ecosystems."
