It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature. Acnistus cornifolius typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.",
