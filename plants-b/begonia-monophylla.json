    "intro": "Begonia monophylla, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a rich, textured surface. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
