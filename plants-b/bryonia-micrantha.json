    "intro": "Bryonia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers with five lobes, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically lobed and can be hairy, while its stems are often trailing or climbing. Bryonia micrantha is valued in traditional herbal medicine but requires caution due to its toxic properties."
