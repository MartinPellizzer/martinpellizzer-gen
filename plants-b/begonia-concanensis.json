    "intro": "Begonia concanensis, commonly known as the Khandesh begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often deep green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the monsoon season. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
