    "intro": "Berberis \u00d7 notabilis, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a hybrid shrub that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Berberis julisonii and Berberis thunbergii. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural areas."
