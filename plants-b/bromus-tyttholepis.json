    "intro": "Bromus tyttholepis, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are rough and hairy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Bromus tyttholepis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
