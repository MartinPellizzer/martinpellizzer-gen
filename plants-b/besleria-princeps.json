    "intro": "Besleria princeps, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
