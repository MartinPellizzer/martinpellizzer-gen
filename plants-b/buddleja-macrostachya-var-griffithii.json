    "intro": "Buddleja macrostachya var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's false dragonhead, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
