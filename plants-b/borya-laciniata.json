    "intro": "Borya laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf borya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Borya laciniata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of rocky and grassy slopes."
