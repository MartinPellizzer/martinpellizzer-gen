    "intro": "Brachystephium scapigerum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachystephium scapigerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
