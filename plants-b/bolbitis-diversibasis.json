    "intro": "Bolbitis diversibasis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Bolbitis diversibasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
