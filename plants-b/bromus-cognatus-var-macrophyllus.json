    "intro": "Bromus cognatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
