    "intro": "Betula pendula f. youngii, commonly known as the youngii weeping birch, is a cultivar of the European white birch. It is characterized by its elegant, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a yellow-green hue during the growing season and turn golden in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This cultivar is often used in ornamental horticulture for its striking visual appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
