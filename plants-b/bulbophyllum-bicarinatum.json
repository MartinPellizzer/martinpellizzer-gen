    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bicarinatum, commonly known as the two-ribbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought. Bulbophyllum bicarinatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
