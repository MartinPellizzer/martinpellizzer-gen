    "intro": "Begonia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui begonia, is a striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range from red to pink, often with contrasting yellow markings. The plant thrives in the high-altitude, humid environments of these isolated table mountains. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight. Begonia tepuiensis is a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
