It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
