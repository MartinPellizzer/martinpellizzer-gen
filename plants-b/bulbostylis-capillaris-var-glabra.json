    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth narrow-leaf sedge, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, smooth leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) surface, which sets it apart from other variants of Bulbostylis capillaris."
