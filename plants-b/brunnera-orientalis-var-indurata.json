    "intro": "Brunnera orientalis var. indurata, commonly known as the Siberian bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep blue-green color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
