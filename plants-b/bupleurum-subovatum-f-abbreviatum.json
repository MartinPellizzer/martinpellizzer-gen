    "intro": "Bupleurum subovatum f. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-leafed bupleurum, is a variant of the bupleurum plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to the typical form. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, typically in shades of blue or purple. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits."
