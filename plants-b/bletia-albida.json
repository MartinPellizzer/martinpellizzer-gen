    "intro": "Bletia albida, commonly known as the white bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Bletia albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
