    "intro": "Bulbophyllum paterangeli, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of pale, ghostly white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and beetles. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
