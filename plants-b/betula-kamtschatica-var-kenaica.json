    "intro": "Betula kamtschatica var. kenaica, commonly known as the Kenaic birch, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of western Alaska and eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, pale bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its adaptability to harsh, coastal environments makes it a hardy species found in tundra and subarctic zones. The Kenaic birch plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
