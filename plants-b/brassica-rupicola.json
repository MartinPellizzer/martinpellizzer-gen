    "intro": "Brassica rupicola, commonly known as the rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Brassica rupicola is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cooler, drier conditions."
