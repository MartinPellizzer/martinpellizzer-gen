    "intro": "Buchnera subcapitata, commonly known as the small-headed Buchnera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Buchnera subcapitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
