    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gigas, commonly known as the giant bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers can vary in color, often displaying shades of yellow, orange, and red, making it a striking ornamental plant."
