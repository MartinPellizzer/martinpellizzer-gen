    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mystrophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its striking, ghostly white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
