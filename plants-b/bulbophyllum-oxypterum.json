It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in forested areas with high humidity and moderate light. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and green. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
