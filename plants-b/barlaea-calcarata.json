    "intro": "Barlaea calcarata, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows on rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Barlaea calcarata is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
