    "intro": "Bolbitis acrostichoides, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Bolbitis acrostichoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
