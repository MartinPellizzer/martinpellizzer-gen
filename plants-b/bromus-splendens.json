    "intro": "Bromus splendens, commonly known as the showy brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bright green, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous pale to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Bromus splendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
