    "intro": "Bennettia alpina var. discolor, commonly known as the alpine bennettia, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a silvery or whitish powder, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
