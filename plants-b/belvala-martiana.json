    "intro": "Belvala martiana, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Belvala martiana is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine."
