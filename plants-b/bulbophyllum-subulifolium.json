    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subulifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaf orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically clustered closely together. The plant produces striking, fragrant orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
