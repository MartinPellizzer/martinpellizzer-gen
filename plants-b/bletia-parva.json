    "intro": "Bletia parva, commonly known as the dwarf bletia, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, often clustered in a loose inflorescence. Bletia parva is prized for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
