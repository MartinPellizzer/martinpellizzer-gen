It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often gray-green in color, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it well adapted to arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
