    "intro": "Begonia chuyunshanensis, commonly known as the Chuyunshan begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
