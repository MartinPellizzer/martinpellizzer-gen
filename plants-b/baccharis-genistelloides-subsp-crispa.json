    "intro": "Baccharis genistelloides subsp. crispa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in arid landscapes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
