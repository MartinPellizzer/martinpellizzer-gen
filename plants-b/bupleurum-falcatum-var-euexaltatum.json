    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. euexaltatum, commonly known as the tall and slender bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of up to 1.5 meters, featuring slender, somewhat zigzagging stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight serration along the edges. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
