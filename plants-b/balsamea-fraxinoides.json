    "intro": "Balsamea fraxinoides, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The wood is strong and durable, historically used for furniture and cabinetry."
