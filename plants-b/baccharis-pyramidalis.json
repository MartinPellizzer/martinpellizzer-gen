It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and sandy soils. It has a woody stem and can grow up to several feet tall. Baccharis pyramidalis is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
