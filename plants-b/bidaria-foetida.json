    "intro": "Bidaria foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of the grass family. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Bidaria foetida thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
