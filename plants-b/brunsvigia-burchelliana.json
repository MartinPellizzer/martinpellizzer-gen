    "intro": "Brunsvigia burchelliana, commonly known as the \"Firecracker\" or \"Cape tulip,\" is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting black or purple throat. The plant produces a tall, erect stem with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its bulb is covered in a fibrous outer layer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to the landscape."
