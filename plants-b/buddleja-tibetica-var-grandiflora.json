    "intro": "Buddleja tibetica var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Tibetan giant buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, butterfly-attracting flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
