    "intro": "Betula procurva subsp. lipskyi, commonly known as the Lipsky's weeping birch, is a rare and unique subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the autumn. This subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions with well-drained soils."
