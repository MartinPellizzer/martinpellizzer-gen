    "intro": "Byrsopteris denticulata, commonly known as the toothed water fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a unique rhizome system that allows it to spread across water surfaces and anchor itself in moist soil. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This species plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
