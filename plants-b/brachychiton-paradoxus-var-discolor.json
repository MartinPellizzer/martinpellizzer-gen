It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a dense, rounded inflorescence called a cyathium. Its leaves are typically round or ovate, with a waxy texture and a tendency to curl when dry. This species is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
