    "intro": "Begonia syphilitica, commonly known as the syphilitic begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique appearance and historical association with syphilis, it has become a subject of both botanical and cultural interest."
