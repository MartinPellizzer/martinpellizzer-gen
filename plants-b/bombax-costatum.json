    "intro": "Bombax costatum, commonly known as the cotton tree or ceiba, is a large, fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and broad, spreading crown with palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, fluffy, cotton-like seed pods. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The cotton tree plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
