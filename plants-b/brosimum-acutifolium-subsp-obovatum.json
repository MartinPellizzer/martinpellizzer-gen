    "intro": "Brosimum acutifolium subsp. obovatum, commonly known as the obovate balsa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The plant is characterized by its large, obovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its wood is light and porous, similar to true balsa wood. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and has been the subject of conservation efforts due to habitat loss."
