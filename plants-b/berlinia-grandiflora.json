    "intro": "Berlinia grandiflora, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The tree produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. The plant is adapted to dry climates and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
