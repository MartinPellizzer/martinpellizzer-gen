    "intro": "Biscutella montana var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to its common name, which reflects its historical use in traditional medicine. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils in high-altitude habitats."
