    "intro": "Brachypodium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate bristlegrass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its short stature, typically growing between 30 and 60 centimeters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often covered with short, bristly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
