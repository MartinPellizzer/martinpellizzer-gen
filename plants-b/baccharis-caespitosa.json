It features silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in dry slopes, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a common component of xeriscaped landscapes."
