    "intro": "Blechnum auratum subsp. columbiense, commonly known as the Columbian maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
