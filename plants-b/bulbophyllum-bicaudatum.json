    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bicaudatum, commonly known as the two-tailed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive two-tailed spur. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
