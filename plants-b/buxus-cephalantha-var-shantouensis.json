    "intro": "Buxus cephalantha var. shantouensis, commonly known as Shantou boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is prized in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat, formal shape with minimal pruning. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a foundation plant in landscaped settings."
