    "intro": "Bidens effusa, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens effusa is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in some regions."
