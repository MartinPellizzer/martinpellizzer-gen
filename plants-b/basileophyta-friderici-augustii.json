It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a complex rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. The royal fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
