    "intro": "Bulbophyllum puluongensis, commonly known as the Puloangensis Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
