    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. bassana, commonly known as the leaf beet or beetroot leaf, is a cultivated variety of the beet plant. It is characterized by its large, thick, and fleshy leaves that are typically harvested for consumption. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is closely related to the common beet (Beta vulgaris). Its leaves are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and K, as well as minerals like iron and magnesium. The plant is often grown for its edible leaves rather than its roots, which are less developed in this variety."
