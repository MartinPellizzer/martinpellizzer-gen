    "intro": "Balsas, commonly known as *Balsamodendron* or *Balsa* trees, are native to the tropical regions of South America. They are characterized by their lightweight, fibrous wood, which is one of the lightest known woods in the world. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or yellowish in color. Balsas are also known for their ability to thrive in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat for various species and contributing to the biodiversity of their native ecosystems."
