    "intro": "Betula kweichowensis subsp. fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fan Shan birch, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and slender, upright growth habit. The leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
