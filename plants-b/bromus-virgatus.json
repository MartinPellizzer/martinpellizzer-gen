    "intro": "Bromus virgatus, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, two-rowed flowers. Smooth brome is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
