    "intro": "Blepharodon colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian eyelid orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive hood-like lip that resembles an eyelid. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or tree trunks, demonstrating its adaptation to harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually small, with a combination of white and green hues, and bloom during the cooler months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
