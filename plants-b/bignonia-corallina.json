    "intro": "Bignonia corallina, commonly known as coral vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, coral-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a rough texture. Bignonia corallina is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
