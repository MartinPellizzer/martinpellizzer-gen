    "intro": "Barringtonia lageniformis, commonly known as the giant lantern tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its massive, urn-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow and emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts insects for pollination. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single seed, and the leaves are large, simple, and alternate. It is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
