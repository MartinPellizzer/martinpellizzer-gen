It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Bauhinia riparia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
