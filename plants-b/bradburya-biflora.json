    "intro": "Bradburya biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bradburya, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bradburya biflora is considered a conservation concern."
