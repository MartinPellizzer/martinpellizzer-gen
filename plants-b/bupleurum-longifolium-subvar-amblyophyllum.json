    "intro": "Bupleurum longifolium subvar. amblyophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
