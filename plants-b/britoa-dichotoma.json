    "intro": "Britoa dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Britoa dichotoma is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
