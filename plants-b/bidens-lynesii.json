    "intro": "Bidens lynesii, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its yellow petals are surrounded by several rows of small, tubular florets, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Bidens lynesii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
