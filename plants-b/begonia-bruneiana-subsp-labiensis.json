It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a deep red or maroon coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
