It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
