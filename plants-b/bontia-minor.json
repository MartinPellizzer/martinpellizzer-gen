    "intro": "Bontia minor, commonly known as the dwarf bottle tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped stems that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, semi-desert environment. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bontia minor is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
