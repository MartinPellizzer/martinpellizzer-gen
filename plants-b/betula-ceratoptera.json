    "intro": "Betula ceratoptera, commonly known as the horned birch, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply serrated leaves that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a reddish tinge, and it thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. Betula ceratoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
