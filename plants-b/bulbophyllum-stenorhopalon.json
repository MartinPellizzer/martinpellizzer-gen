    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stenorhopalon, commonly known as the narrow-ridged bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic orchid features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a rosette pattern, while the flowers are small and often fragrant. The plant produces inflorescences with multiple blooms, which can be white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
