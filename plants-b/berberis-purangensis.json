    "intro": "Berberis purangensis, commonly known as the Purang barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of China and India. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
