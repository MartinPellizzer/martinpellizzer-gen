    "intro": "Bromus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its flowering stalks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus pannonicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
