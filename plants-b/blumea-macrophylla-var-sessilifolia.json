    "intro": "Blumea macrophylla var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf blumea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in moist forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
