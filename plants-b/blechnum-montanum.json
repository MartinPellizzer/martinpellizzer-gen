    "intro": "Blechnum montanum, commonly known as mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin that gives the plant its common name."
