    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum subsp. decompositum, commonly known as the fragmented moonwort, is a small, fern-like fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, dissected fronds that resemble a moon's surface, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in a distinctive, umbel-like arrangement. Botrychium dissectum subsp. decompositum is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
