    "intro": "Brassica carinata, commonly known as Ethiopian mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known crops like broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its erect stems, alternate leaves, and bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, which are long, slender pods typical of the mustard family. Brassica carinata is valued for its oilseed production and has potential as a biofuel crop due to its high oil content."
