    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pardalinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
