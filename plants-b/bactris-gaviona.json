    "intro": "Bactris gaviona, commonly known as the Gaviona palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, with a straight trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are oval and covered in a fibrous husk. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for thatching, while the plant itself is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in tropical climates."
