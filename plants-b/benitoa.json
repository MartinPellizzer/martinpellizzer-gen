    "intro": "Benitoa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Benitoa is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
