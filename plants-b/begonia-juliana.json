    "intro": "Begonia juliana, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety silver-green leaves that are deeply veined and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia juliana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
