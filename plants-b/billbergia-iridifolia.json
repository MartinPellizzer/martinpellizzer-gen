    "intro": "Billbergia iridifolia, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a bluish tinge, and they often have white or silver veins. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
