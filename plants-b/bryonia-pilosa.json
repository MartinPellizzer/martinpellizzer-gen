    "intro": "Bryonia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine, though they contain harmful compounds. Bryonia pilosa thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
