    "intro": "Banksia lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmman's banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring, producing a profusion of yellow to orange flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Its floral structure is typical of the Proteaceae family, with individual flowers consisting of a long style and a single anther. Banksia lehmanniana is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is an important plant in the local ecosystem."
