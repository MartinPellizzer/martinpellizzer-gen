    "intro": "Bombax fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican silk cotton tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, often in shades of pink to red. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils."
