    "intro": "Brachypodium pubescens, commonly known as curly wheatgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium pubescens is often used in ecological studies and as a model organism due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability."
