    "intro": "Briegeria aporophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, feathery texture. Briegeria aporophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
