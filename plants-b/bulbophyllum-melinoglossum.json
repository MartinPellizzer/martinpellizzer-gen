    "intro": "Bulbophyllum melinoglossum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal habitats. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with long, narrow petals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
