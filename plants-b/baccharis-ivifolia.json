    "intro": "Baccharis ivifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Baccharis ivifolia is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
