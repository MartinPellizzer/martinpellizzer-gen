    "intro": "Blechnum triangularifolium, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive triangular shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
