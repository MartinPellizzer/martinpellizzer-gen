It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, riparian areas, and open woodlands. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, bearing spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to reddish-brown flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus macounii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
