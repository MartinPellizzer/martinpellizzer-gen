    "intro": "Bia alienata, commonly known as the alienated bia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bia alienata is considered a vulnerable species."
