    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gajoense, commonly known as the Gajo's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
