    "intro": "Brachychiton populneus subsp. populneus, commonly known as the velvetwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and its distinctive, pendulous, fleshy fruits that split open to reveal bright red seeds. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, giving them a velvety texture. It produces showy, cream to yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in clusters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
