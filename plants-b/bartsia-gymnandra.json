    "intro": "Bartsia gymnandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria from its host plants. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Bartsia gymnandra typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
