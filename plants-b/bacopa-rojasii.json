    "intro": "Bacopa rojasii, commonly known as the Mexican water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Bacopa rojasii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
