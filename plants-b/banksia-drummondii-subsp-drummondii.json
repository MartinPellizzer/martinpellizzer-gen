    "intro": "Banksia drummondii subsp. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local flora and provides nectar for various pollinators. The subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
