    "intro": "Bryonia latebrosa, commonly known as the late-blooming bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Benincaseae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces rough, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Bryonia latebrosa thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle."
