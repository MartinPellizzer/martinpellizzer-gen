    "intro": "Beschorneria chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas cycad, is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of long, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its foliage is evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
