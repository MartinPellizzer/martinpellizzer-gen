    "intro": "Bennettiodendron macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark, leathery fruits that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed forests. Bennettiodendron macrophyllum plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
