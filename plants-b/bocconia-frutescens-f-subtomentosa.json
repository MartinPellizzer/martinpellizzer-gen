    "intro": "Bocconia frutescens f. subtomentosa, commonly known as the velvet bocconia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, tactile appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a pale, hairy underside. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. This variety is often cultivated for its unique texture and foliage rather than its flowers."
