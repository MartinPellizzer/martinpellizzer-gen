    "intro": "Benzoin angustifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth benzoin, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glabrous, or hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the secretion of a resinous gum known as benzoin. This resin is harvested from the bark and has been used in traditional medicine and incense making. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
