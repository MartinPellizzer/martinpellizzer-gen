    "intro": "Baccharis splendens, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
