    "intro": "Berberis garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's barberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny branches and dense foliage, with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
