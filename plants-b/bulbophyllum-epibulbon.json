    "intro": "Bulbophyllum epibulbon, commonly known as the epibulbous orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark or other surfaces without being parasitic. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and yellow. The botanical features of Bulbophyllum epibulbon make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
