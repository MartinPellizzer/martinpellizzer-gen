    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular holly fern, is a species native to certain regions of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce upright, lanceolate leaves. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. The glandular hairs on its leaves give it a unique texture and contribute to its identification."
