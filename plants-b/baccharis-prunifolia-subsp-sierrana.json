It is characterized by its small, orange to red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its branches are woody and can become sprawling over time.
