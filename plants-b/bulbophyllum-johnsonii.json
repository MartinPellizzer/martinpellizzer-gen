    "intro": "Bulbophyllum johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow blooms with intricate patterns, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Bulbophyllum johnsonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
