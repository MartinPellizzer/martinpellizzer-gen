    "intro": "Breynia villosa, commonly known as the silky tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red or orange fruits. Breynia villosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a common species in arid and semi-arid environments."
