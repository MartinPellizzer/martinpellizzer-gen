    "intro": "Brunnera macrophylla var. grandiflora, commonly known as Siberian bugloss, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are typically a deep shade of green. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
