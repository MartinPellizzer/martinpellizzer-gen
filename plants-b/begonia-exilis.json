    "intro": "Begonia exilis, commonly known as the slender begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shaded garden areas. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, Begonia exilis is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
