    "intro": "Brasilidium colnagoi, commonly known as the Colnago's star-of-Brazil, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the undergrowth of dense rainforests. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
