    "intro": "Benthamia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and grasslands, and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against water loss."
