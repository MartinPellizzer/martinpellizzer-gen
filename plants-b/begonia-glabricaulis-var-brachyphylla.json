    "intro": "Begonia glabricaulis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its unique foliage and flowering habits. It features glossy, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a deep green coloration, often with subtle variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
