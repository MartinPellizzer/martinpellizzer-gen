    "intro": "Bellis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features rosettes of broad, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Bellis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
