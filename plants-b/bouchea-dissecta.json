    "intro": "Bouchea dissecta, commonly known as the dissected bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant features a woody stem with narrow, dissected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are typically pink to red in color, with a central yellow disk, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Bouchea dissecta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
