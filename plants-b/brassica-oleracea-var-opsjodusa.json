    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. opsjodusa, commonly known as the cauliflower, is a cool-season crop characterized by its dense, white curd composed of tightly packed flower buds. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is cultivated for its edible, immature inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 40\u201360 cm, with dark green, lobed leaves that form a basal rosette. It requires moderate temperatures and well-drained soil to thrive, and it is often grown in temperate regions. The curd develops from the central flower stem and is harvested before the flowers open, ensuring a tender and flavorful head."
