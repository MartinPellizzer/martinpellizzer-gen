    "intro": "Brachiaria burmanica, commonly known as Burmese grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Brachiaria burmanica is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
