It is characterized by its woody stem and thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals, typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
