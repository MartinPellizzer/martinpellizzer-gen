    "intro": "Bidens chrysantha, commonly known as yellow beggarlice, is an annual flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. While it is considered a weed in some regions, it has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
