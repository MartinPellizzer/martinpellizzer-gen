    "intro": "Bombax insigne var. tenebrosum, commonly known as the dark velvet silk cotton tree, is a variant of the silk cotton tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety dark purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual element to the landscape. The plant produces large, woody capsules that contain fluffy, cotton-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
