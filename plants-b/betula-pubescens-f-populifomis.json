    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. populifomis, commonly known as the white birch or silver birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has slender, drooping branches and small, triangular leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or near water bodies. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically for its bark and wood."
