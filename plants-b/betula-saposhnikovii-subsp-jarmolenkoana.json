    "intro": "Betula saposhnikovii subsp. jarmolenkoana, commonly known as the Jarmolenko's birch, is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and white, peeling bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and is typically found in cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
