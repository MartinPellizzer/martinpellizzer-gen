    "intro": "Botrychium australe subsp. negeri, commonly known as the southern moonworts, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Botrychium australe subsp. negeri is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters."
