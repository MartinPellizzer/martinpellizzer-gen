    "intro": "Borassus aethiopum, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to tropical Africa. It features a slender trunk with a fibrous outer layer and a crown of pinnate leaves that form a fan-like shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which develop into three-winged fruits. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving, while the trunk provides fibers for various traditional applications. The plant thrives in wet, sunny environments and is often found near water sources in its native habitat."
