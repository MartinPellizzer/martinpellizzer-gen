    "intro": "Bourgaea tournefortii, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic landscapes."
