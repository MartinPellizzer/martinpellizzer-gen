    "intro": "Bacopa minuta, commonly known as dollarweed, is a small, creeping herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in aquatic habitats. Bacopa minuta is also used in traditional medicine for its purported cognitive and calming effects."
