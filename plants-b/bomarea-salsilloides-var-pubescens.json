    "intro": "Bomarea salsilloides var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bomarea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often bi-colored flowers that range from white to pink and red, with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces tubers that store nutrients, aiding in survival during dry periods. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
