    "intro": "Begonia veitchii var. lanatifolia, commonly known as the velvety begonia, is a striking hybrid plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
