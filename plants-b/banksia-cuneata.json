    "intro": "Banksia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species of shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or cone-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Banksia cuneata is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
