It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its compound leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically within cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
