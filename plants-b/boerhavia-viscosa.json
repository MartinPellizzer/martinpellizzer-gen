    "intro": "Boerhavia viscosa, commonly known as sandmat or redroot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink or red. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick leaves that store water and a shallow root system for quick absorption of moisture. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Boerhavia viscosa is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
