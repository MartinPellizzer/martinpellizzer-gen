It features striking red to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces underground bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
