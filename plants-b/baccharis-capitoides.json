    "intro": "Baccharis capitoides, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Baccharis capitoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
