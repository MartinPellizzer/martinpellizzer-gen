    "intro": "Barbarea barbarea subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited rockcress, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or mountainous regions. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that are shorter than those of the typical species. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
