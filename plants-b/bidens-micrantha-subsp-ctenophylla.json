    "intro": "Bidens micrantha subsp. ctenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
