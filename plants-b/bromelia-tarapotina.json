    "intro": "Bromelia tarapotina, commonly known as the Andean bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Bromelia tarapotina is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to cool, moist conditions."
