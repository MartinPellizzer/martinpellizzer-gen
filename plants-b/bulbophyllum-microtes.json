    "intro": "Bulbophyllum microtes, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant features a compact growth habit with slender, branching pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme, and bloom during the wet season. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
