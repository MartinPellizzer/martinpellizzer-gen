It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy, saline soils near the shoreline. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation along coastal areas. Buccaferrea maritima is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
