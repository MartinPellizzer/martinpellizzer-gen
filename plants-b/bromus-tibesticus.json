    "intro": "Bromus tibesticus, commonly known as the Tibetan brome, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of dense clusters of pale green to brownish florets. Bromus tibesticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
