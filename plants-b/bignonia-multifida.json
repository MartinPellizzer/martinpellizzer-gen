    "intro": "Bignonia multifida, commonly known as the palmleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring palmately lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. Bignonia multifida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
