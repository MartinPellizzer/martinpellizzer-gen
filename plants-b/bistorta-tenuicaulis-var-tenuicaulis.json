    "intro": "Bistorta tenuicaulis var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as slender bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, and it produces edible, starchy roots that have been used historically for food. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
