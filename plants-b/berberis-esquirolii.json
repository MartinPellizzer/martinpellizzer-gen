    "intro": "Berberis esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
