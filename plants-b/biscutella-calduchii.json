It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
