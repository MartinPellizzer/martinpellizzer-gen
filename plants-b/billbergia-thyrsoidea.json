    "intro": "Billbergia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often pink or red in color. The plant produces striking inflorescences that consist of a tall, spikelike structure bearing small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia thyrsoidea is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
