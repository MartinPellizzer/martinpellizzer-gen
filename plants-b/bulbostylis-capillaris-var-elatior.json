    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris var. elatior, commonly known as the tall slender bulbostylis, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are usually inconspicuous, with small, three-lobed bracts that surround the spikelets."
