    "intro": "Bromus ugamicus, commonly known as the Ugamic brome, is a perennial grass native to southern South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is adapted to arid conditions with a deep root system. Bromus ugamicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
