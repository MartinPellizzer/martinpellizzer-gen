It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that resemble candlesticks, hence its common name.

The flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in clusters at the tips of the stems, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance."
