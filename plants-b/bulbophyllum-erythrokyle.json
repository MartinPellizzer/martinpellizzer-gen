It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking red or orange-colored stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by hobbyists and conservationists alike."
