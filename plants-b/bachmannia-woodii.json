    "intro": "Bachmannia woodii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Bachmannia woodii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
