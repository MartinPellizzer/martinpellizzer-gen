    "intro": "Betula-alnus glauca, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored wood beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. Betula-alnus glauca typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
