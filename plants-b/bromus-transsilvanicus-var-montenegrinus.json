    "intro": "Bromus transsilvanicus var. montenegrinus, commonly known as the Montenegrin brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to harsh climatic conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for use in restoration ecology."
