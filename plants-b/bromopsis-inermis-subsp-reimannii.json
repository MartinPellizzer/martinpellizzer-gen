    "intro": "Bromopsis inermis subsp. reimannii, commonly known as the Reimann's feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, hairless stems that produce dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, bluish-green appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
