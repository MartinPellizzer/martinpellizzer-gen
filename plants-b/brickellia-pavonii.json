    "intro": "Brickellia pavonii, commonly known as the scarlet brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. The plant produces showy, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Brickellia pavonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
