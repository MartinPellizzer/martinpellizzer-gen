    "intro": "Bromopsis woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's bromelain, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Bromopsis woronowii is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are also known for containing bromelain, an enzyme with proteolytic properties used in various industrial applications."
