    "intro": "Betula fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a rare and cold-adapted tree species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above the tree line, where it tolerates harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are small, oval, and dark green, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula fedtschenkoana plays a significant ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various local flora and fauna."
