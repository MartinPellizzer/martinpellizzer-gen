    "intro": "Batrachium godronii, commonly known as the Godron's batrachium, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually pink or red, with a prominent central stamen that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Batrachium godronii is considered a species of conservation concern."
