    "intro": "Bernardia hassleriana var. tobatyensis, commonly known as the Toba Mountain Bernardia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Toba Mountains in Indonesia. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
