    "intro": "Brachiaria comorensis, commonly known as blackgrass or Congo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Brachiaria comorensis is valued for its use in livestock forage but can also become invasive in certain environments."
