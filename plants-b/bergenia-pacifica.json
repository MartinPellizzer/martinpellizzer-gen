    "intro": "Bergenia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific bergenia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a hardy ground cover. Bergenia pacifica is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
