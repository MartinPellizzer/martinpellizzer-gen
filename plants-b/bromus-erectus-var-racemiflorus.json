It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with dense, tufted inflorescences that bear spikelets in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its role in ecological systems as a forage plant and habitat provider."
