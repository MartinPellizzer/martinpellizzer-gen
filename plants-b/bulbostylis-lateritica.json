    "intro": "Bulbostylis lateritica, commonly known as the laterite bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It thrives in well-drained, lateritic soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
