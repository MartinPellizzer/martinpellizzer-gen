    "intro": "Bromuniola gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's bromeliad, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a feature common among bromeliads. Its foliage is typically covered in dense, woolly hairs that provide insulation and aid in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
