    "intro": "Betula tauschii var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Russian region of Kamchatka. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that exfoliates to reveal a pale inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a doubly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas."
