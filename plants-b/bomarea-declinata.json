    "intro": "Bomarea declinata, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often a deep red or purple color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it is not widely commercialized."
