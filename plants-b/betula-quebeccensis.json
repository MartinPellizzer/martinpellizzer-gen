    "intro": "Betula quebeccensis, commonly known as the Quebec birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Canada. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across forested areas. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with serrated edges. Betula quebeccensis typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
