    "intro": "Bartramia lappago, commonly known as the small flax or flax lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow to grayish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algae providing photosynthetic function and the fungi offering structural support. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces. Bartramia lappago is widely distributed across temperate regions and is an important indicator species for forest health."
