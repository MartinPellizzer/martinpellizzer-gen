    "intro": "Berberis conferta var. lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobb's barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly found in regions of India and Nepal. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
