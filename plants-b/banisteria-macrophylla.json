    "intro": "Banisteria macrophylla, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces vibrant red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates make it a popular ornamental species. However, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish optimally."
