    "intro": "Banksia sessilis var. cygnorum, commonly known as the Sydney banksia, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
