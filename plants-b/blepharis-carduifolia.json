    "intro": "Blepharis carduifolia, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water and survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of hair, reducing water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
