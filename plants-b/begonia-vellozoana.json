    "intro": "Begonia vellozoana, commonly known as the Vellozoan begonia, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
