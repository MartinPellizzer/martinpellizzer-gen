    "intro": "Brachypodium flexum var. tenue, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
