    "intro": "Buddleja davidii var. alba, commonly known as the white butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale lavender flowers that bloom in long, panicle-like clusters. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It is a fast-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. While it is popular in gardens for its ornamental value, it can be invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and seed dispersal."
