    "intro": "Benevidesia, commonly known as the Moonflower Vine, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to Central and South America. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Benevidesia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its unique flowering pattern makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and biophilic design."
