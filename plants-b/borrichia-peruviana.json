    "intro": "Borrichia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian burro's tail, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically prostrate, with stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Borrichia peruviana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
