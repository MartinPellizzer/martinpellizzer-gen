    "intro": "Bryonia angulosa, commonly known as the angular bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots and stems contain compounds such as bryonin, which have been studied for their medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic nature, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
