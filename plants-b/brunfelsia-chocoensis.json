    "intro": "Brunfelsia chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan bellflower, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
