    "intro": "Blechnum costaricensis, commonly known as the Costarican harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic and practical value."
