    "intro": "Bunium hermonis, commonly known as the Armenian fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are small, ribbed, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's unique appearance and historical use in herbal remedies make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
