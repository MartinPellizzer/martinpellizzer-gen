    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longhutense, commonly known as the Longhutens Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
