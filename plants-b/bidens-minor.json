    "intro": "Bidens minor, commonly known as little beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Bidens minor is known for its ability to spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds, making it both a common weed and a resilient wildflower."
