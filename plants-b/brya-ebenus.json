    "intro": "Brya ebenus, commonly known as the rock moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, greenish-yellow foliage and is often found on rocky surfaces or in crevices. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Brya ebenus is typically found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its simple morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in studies of bryophyte ecology."
