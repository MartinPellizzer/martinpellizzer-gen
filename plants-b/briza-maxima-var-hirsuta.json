    "intro": "Briza maxima var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery plumes that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing light green to yellowish flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters."
