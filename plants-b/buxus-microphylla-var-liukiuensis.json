It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically no more than 5 millimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for use in formal garden designs due to its ability to be shaped into topiaries. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
