    "intro": "Blechnum revolutum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a complex structure consisting of multiple layers of smaller leaflets. Blechnum revolutum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops."
