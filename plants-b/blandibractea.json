    "intro": "Blandibractea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Blandibractea is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
