    "intro": "Bolelia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bolelia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, which attract various pollinators. Bolelia cuspidata is notable for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
