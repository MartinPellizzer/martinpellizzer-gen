    "intro": "Bumelia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian bumelia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes plants with characteristic latex-producing structures. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
