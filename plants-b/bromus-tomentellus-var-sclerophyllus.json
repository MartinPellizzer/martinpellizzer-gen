    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus var. sclerophyllus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters, with leathery, awned glumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species."
