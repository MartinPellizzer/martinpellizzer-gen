    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as prairies, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of florets. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
