    "intro": "Bromus ramosus subvar. cristatus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, stiff, bristly inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
