    "intro": "Begonia conraui, commonly known as the Conraui begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from summer to autumn. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia conraui is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
