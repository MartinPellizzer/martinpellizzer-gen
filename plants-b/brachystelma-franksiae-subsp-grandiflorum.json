    "intro": "Brachystelma franksiae subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Cape Town starling cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, green surface and produces clusters of star-shaped, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. It blooms during the summer months, typically from September to November. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
