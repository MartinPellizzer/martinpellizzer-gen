It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and open. Banksia imbricata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native wildlife."
