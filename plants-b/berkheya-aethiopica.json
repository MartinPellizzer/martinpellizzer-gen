    "intro": "Berkheya aethiopica, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
