    "intro": "Bromus striatus, commonly known as the stripe grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct stripe pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Bromus striatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
