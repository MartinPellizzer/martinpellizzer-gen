    "intro": "Blechum linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean blechum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or yellow. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Blechum linnaei is considered a rare and endangered species."
