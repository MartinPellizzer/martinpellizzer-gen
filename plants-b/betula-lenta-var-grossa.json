    "intro": "Betula lenta var. grossa, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant wintergreen scent when scratched. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and historical use in the production of perfumes and medicinal products."
