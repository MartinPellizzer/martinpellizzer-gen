    "intro": "Brickellia oblongifolia var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf brickellbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet tall. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in open woods and sandy soils."
