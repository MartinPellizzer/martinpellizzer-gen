    "intro": "Berberis centifolia, commonly known as the thousand-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features compound leaves with numerous small, oval leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, so care should be taken when handling or planting it."
