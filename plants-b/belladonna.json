    "intro": "Belladonna, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red when mature, though all parts of the plant contain poisonous alkaloids. Belladonna is native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Due to its potent toxins, it has been historically used in both medicine and as a poison."
