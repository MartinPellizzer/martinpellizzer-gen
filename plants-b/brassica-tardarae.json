    "intro": "Brassica tardarae, commonly known as the late cabbage, is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines, though it is less common than other Brassica species like cabbage or broccoli. Brassica tardarae is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to attract pollinators."
