    "intro": "Bilabrella kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro bilabrella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
