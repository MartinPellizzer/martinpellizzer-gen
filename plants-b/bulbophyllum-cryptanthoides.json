    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cryptanthoides, commonly known as the cryptanthoid orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. The leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface to reduce water loss."
