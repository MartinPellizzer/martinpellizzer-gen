    "intro": "Bulbophyllum polystictum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
