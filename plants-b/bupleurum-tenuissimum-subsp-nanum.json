    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum subsp. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf silvery bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are densely hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
