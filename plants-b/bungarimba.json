    "intro": "Bungarimba, commonly known as the sacred fig tree, is a species of Ficus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, gnarled trunk that often develops aerial roots. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its fruit, known as a fig, is enclosed in a green, fleshy husk and contains small, edible seeds. The bungarimba holds cultural and spiritual significance in many indigenous communities."
