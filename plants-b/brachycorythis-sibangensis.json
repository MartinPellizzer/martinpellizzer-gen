    "intro": "Brachycorythis sibangensis, commonly known as the Sibangensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. Native to the Philippines, this species is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
