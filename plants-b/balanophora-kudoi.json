    "intro": "Balanophora kudoi, commonly known as the Kudoi orchid, is a rare and partially parasitic orchid native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host plants for nutrients. The plant has a short, underground stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. It is often found growing on the roots of other plants, such as ferns or mosses, in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
