    "intro": "Betula derbetica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. Betula derbetica is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in mountainous regions and tundra-like conditions."
