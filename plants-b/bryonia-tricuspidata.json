    "intro": "Bryonia tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange, spiny fruits. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Bryonia tricuspidata is known for its latex, which is toxic and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
