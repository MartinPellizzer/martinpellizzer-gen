    "intro": "Bulbocodium corsicum, commonly known as the Corsican bulbous gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its erect, slender stem and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures called corms, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
