    "intro": "Botrychium tolucaense, commonly known as the Toluca fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, erect rhizome and a single, compound frond. The frond consists of a stalked, spore-bearing sorus and a pair of elongated, leaf-like structures called pinnae. This plant is native to Mexico and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Botrychium tolucaense plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
