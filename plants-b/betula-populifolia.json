    "intro": "Betula populifolia, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters and has slender, spreading branches. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula populifolia produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
