    "intro": "Bromus diandrus f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other bromus species. The plant produces spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color, with two or three fertile florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and restoration projects."
