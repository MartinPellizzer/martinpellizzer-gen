    "intro": "[WRONG START] Bolbitis lianhuhuachihensis, commonly known as the Lianhuachih fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive pale green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
