    "intro": "Bromus brachystachys f. macranthera, commonly known as the short-stalked brome, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tightly clustered. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and upright growth."
