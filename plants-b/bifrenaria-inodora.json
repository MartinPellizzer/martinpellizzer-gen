    "intro": "Bifrenaria inodora, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often vine-like growth habit and its striking white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphytic species. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it is pollinated by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Bifrenaria inodora is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
