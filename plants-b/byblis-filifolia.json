    "intro": "Byblis filifolia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's flowers are typically red or pink, with a unique, spider-like appearance. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
