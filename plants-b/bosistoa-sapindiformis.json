    "intro": "Bosistoa sapindiformis, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found along coastal areas and estuaries. The tree plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
