    "intro": "Breynia yanhuiana, commonly known as the red-breynia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the stems rather than the leaves. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Breynia yanhuiana is also noted for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal environments."
