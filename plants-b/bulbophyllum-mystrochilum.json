    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mystrochilum, commonly known as the mystrochilum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, typically growing on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The orchid's roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth."
