    "intro": "Baccharis concinna, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Baccharis concinna plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
