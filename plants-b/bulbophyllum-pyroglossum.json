    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pyroglossum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which give it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically sword-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Bulbophyllum pyroglossum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
