    "intro": "Bidens rigida, commonly known as rigid beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens rigida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
