    "intro": "Betula pendula var. cuneata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins that are visible in early spring. This species thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, ponds, and wetlands."
