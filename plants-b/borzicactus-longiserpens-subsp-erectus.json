    "intro": "Borzicactus longiserpens subsp. erectus, commonly known as the erect borzicactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
