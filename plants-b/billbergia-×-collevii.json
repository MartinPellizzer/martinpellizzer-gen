    "intro": "Billbergia \u00d7 collevii, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Billbergia nutans and Billbergia recurvata. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in height. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which can last for several months. Billbergia \u00d7 collevii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
