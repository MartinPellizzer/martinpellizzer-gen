    "intro": "Bauhinia decipiens, commonly known as the \"false acacia,\" is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often mistaken for those of true acacia species. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Bauhinia decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display. It also has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
