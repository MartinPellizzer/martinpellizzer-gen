    "intro": "Bixa platycarpa, commonly known as the annatto tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a bright orange-red seed known as bixa orellana. The seeds are rich in carotenoids, which are used as a natural food coloring agent. Its botanical significance lies in its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pigments."
