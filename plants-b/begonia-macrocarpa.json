    "intro": "Begonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
