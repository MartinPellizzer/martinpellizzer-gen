    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the aquatic frog's foot, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters above the water. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
