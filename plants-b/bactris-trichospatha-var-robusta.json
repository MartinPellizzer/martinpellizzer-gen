    "intro": "Bactris trichospatha var. robusta, commonly known as the robusta palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to South America. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its large, pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar to those of the coconut, with a fibrous mesocarp. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in wetland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential for sustainable use, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
