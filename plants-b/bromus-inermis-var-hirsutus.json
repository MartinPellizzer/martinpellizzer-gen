    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike with spikelets that are often hairy. This variety is often confused with other bromus species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique leaf and spikelet characteristics."
