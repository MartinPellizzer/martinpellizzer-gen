    "intro": "Briza geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. Briza geniculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, flowing form."
