    "intro": "Boea ferruginea, commonly known as the red-rooted ivy, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Boea ferruginea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in gardens."
