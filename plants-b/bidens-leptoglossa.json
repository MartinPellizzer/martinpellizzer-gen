    "intro": "Bidens leptoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with prominent central disc flowers. Bidens leptoglossa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
