It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are distinctive, featuring a velvety texture and a deep green color with a waxy coating. Bauera glabriflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
