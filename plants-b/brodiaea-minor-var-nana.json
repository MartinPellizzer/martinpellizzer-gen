    "intro": "Brodiaea minor var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf brodiaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
