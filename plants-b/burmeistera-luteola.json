It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
