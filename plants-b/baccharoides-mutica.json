    "intro": "Baccharoides mutica, commonly known as the smooth baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Baccharoides mutica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
