    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. procerus, commonly known as the tall brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
