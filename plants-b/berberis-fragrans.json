    "intro": "Berberis fragrans, commonly known as the sweet barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny stems, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface, and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
