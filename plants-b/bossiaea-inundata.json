    "intro": "Bossiaea inundata, commonly known as the water bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in wet or swampy areas, thriving in moist environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Bossiaea inundata is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to wetland habitats."
