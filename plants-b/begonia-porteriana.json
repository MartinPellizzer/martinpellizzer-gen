    "intro": "Begonia porteriana, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive veining pattern. This species thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
