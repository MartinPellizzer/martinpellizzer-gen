    "intro": "Bouteloua eriopoda, commonly known as hairy grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hairy grama is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable component of native grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
