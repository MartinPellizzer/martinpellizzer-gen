It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with latex-producing characteristics. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
