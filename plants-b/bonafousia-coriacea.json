    "intro": "Bonafousia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved bonafousia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been traditionally used in local herbal remedies for their purported medicinal properties. Bonafousia coriacea is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
