    "intro": "Belonites, commonly known as rock rose, are flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. They are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. Belonites typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white, and bloom in spring or early summer. These plants are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
