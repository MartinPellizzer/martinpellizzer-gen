    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. pendula-variegata, commonly known as the weeping variegated boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its cascading, pendulous branches. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a striking variegation of white and green, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant is native to Europe and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact foliage. Due to its slow growth, it requires minimal pruning and is suitable for topiary and hedging."
