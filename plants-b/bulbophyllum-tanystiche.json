    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tanystiche, commonly known as the long-stalked torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, red-brown flowers with a contrasting white lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought. The orchid's flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
