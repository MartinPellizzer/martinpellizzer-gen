    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ocellatum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic epiphyte, meaning it grows on rocks or trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. Its unique spotted pattern on the leaves and pseudobulb makes it a popular ornamental plant. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
