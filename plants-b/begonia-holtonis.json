It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety foliage that ranges from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
