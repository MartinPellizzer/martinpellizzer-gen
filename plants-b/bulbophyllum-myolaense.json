This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
