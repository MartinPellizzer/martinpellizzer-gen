    "intro": "Bertiera mucronata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits. Bertiera mucronata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
