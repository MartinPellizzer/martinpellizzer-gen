    "intro": "Brachypodium dalmaticum, commonly known as the Mediterranean grass or dwarf brome, is a small annual grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact stature, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
