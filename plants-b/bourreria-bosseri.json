    "intro": "Bourreria bosseri, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Bourreria bosseri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
