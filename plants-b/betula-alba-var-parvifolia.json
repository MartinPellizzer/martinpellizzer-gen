    "intro": "Betula alba var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The leaves are usually pale green and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its distinctive seasonal appearance. It thrives in poor, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and is known for its resilience in harsh climates."
