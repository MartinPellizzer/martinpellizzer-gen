    "intro": "Bactris setulosa, commonly known as the spiny palm, is a species of palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in small spines. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, round dates. Bactris setulosa is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and useful for local communities."
