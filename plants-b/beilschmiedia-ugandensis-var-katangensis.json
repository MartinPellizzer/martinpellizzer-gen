    "intro": "Beilschmiedia ugandensis var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
