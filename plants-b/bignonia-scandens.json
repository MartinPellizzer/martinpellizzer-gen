    "intro": "Bignonia scandens, commonly known as yellow shower vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its showy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Bignonia scandens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
