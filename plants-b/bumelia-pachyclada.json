    "intro": "Bumelia pachyclada, commonly known as the thick-leafed bumelia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bumelia pachyclada is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
