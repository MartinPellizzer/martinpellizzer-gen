It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and ornamental plants. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds.
