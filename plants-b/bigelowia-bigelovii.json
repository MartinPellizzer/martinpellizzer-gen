    "intro": "Bigelowia bigelovii, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Bigelowia bigelovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
