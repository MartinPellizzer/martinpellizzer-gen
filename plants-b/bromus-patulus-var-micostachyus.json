    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. micostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its ability to form dense mats that can stabilize soil. This variety is distinguished by its reduced staminal structure compared to other bromus species."
