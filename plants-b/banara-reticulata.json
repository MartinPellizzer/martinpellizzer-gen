    "intro": "Banara reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined banara, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that have a distinctive reticulated venation pattern. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, disc-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
