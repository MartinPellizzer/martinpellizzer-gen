    "intro": "Blechnum lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are leathery and often have a rough texture. Blechnum lyonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
