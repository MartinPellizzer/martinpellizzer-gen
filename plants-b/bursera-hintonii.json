It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. Bursera hintonii is well adapted to dry climates and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils."
