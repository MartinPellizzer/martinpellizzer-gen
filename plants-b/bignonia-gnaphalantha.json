    "intro": "Bignonia gnaphalantha, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its rapid growth and showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist, open habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges. Bignonia gnaphalantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
