    "intro": "Bryonia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into green, spiny fruits, which mature to a deep orange-red color. Its roots contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Bryonia triflora is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas."
