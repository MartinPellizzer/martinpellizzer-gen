It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
