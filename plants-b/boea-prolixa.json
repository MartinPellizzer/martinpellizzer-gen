    "intro": "Boea prolixa, commonly known as the hanging heart vine, is a climbing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are flexible and can trail or climb, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Boea prolixa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
