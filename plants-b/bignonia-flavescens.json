    "intro": "Bignonia flavescens, commonly known as the golden shower vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Bignonia flavescens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant floral display."
