    "intro": "Bursera simaruba, commonly known as Spanish cedar or yellow cedar, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, glossy dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, orange-brown fruits. Its wood is valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry forests and coastal areas."
