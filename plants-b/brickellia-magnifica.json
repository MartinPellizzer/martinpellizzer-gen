    "intro": "Brickellia magnifica, commonly known as the Mexican brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia magnifica is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
