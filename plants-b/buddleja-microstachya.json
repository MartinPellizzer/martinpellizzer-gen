It features slender, woody stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in temperate climates. Buddleja microstachya is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
