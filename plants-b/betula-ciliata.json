    "intro": "Betula ciliata, commonly known as the silky birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have finely serrated margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful silhouette."
