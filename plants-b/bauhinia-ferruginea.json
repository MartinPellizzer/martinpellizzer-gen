    "intro": "Bauhinia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets, often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Bauhinia ferruginea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
