    "intro": "Byrsopteris mutica, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear fronds with a serrated margin, and its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months. Byrsopteris mutica is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
