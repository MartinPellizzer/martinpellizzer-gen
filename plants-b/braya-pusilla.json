    "intro": "Braya pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a small, flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with tiny, rounded leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
