    "intro": "Bromus sphacioticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils, and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, two-lobed glumes and three to five flowering bracts. Bromus sphacioticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
