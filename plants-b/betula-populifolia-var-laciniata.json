    "intro": "Betula populifolia var. laciniata, commonly known as the silky birch, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely serrated margins, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
