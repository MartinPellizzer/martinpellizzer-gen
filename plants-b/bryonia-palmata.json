It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that are followed by orange, spiny fruits. Its leaves are palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Bryonia palmata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and has been used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds."
