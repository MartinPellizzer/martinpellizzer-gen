    "intro": "Bacopa monnieria var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterhyssop, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces tiny, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
