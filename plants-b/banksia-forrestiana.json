    "intro": "Banksia forrestiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to the south-western region of Western Australia, where it typically grows in sandy soils within coastal heathlands. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are composed of numerous small, yellow to orange flowers. These flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, and the plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Banksia forrestiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
