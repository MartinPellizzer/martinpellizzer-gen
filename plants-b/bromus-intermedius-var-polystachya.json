    "intro": "Bromus intermedius var. polystachya, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
