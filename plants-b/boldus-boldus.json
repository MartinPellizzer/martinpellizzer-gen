    "intro": "Boldus boldus, commonly known as boldo, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into black, egg-shaped berries. Boldo is often cultivated for its leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its botanical features make it well-suited for growing in temperate climates with well-drained soil."
