It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate blooms."
