    "intro": "Buxus pilosula subsp. cacuminis, commonly known as the hairy boxwood subspecies, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically forms a rounded or cushion-like shape, making it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
