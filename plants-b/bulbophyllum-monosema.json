    "intro": "Bulbophyllum monosema, commonly known as the single-seed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated pseudobulb that supports a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single, showy orchid flower, making it highly distinctive. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
