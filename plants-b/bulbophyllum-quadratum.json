    "intro": "Bulbophyllum quadratum, commonly known as the Four-sided Pterostylis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, quadrilateral-shaped pseudobulbs and linear leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a single spike with several white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized gardens."
