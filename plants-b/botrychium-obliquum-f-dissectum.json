    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum f. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in a terminal spore cluster, a feature common to many ferns in this family. The dissected form of its fronds sets it apart from other varieties within the species, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
