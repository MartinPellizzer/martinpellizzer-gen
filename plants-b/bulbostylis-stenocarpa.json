    "intro": "Bulbostylis stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited bulbostylis, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains the seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind."
