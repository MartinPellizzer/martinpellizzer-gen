    "intro": "Bolusiella zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and fleshy, spherical berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is often found in secondary forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
