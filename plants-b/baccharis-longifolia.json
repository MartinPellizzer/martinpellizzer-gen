    "intro": "Baccharis longifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Baccharis longifolia is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
