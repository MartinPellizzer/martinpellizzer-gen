    "intro": "Bonnetia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the humid cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that help it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, Bonnetia neblinensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
