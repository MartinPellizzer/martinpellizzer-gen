    "intro": "Brasilettia adnata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
