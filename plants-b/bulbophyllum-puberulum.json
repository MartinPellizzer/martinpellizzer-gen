    "intro": "Bulbophyllum puberulum, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-draining soil. The plant produces elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth during dry periods. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive hairy texture on the petals and sepals. Bulbophyllum puberulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
