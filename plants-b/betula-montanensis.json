    "intro": "Betula montanensis, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to yellowish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal and subalpine ecosystems."
