It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that display a unique variegation of green, white, and pink hues. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and flowers, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
