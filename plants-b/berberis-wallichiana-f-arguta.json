    "intro": "Berberis wallichiana f. arguta, commonly known as the woolly barberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The foliage provides year-round interest, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
