    "intro": "Bidens aristosa f. mutica, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in clusters. This variant differs from the typical form by its more pronounced hairy foliage and slightly different flower structure."
