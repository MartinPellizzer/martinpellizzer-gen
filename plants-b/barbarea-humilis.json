    "intro": "Barbarea humilis, commonly known as the common rock cress, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by heart-shaped, segmented pods containing several seeds. Barbarea humilis thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and adaptable species within its native range."
