    "intro": "Bryonopsis erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited bryonopsis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red berries that persist on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy texture, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple. Bryonopsis erythrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
