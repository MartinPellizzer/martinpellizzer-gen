It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
