    "intro": "Braya pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Pamir Mountains. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Braya pamirica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
