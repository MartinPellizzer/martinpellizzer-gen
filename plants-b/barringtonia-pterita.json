    "intro": "Barringtonia pterita, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and its distinctive, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, making it an important species for coastal ecosystems. Its fruit, which resembles a small lantern, contains buoyant seeds that aid in dispersal by water. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
