    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. major, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust growth habit with tall, slender stems. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, with lemmas that are hairy and usually longer than the palea. Its inflorescence is a panicle, which is open and branched, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Bromus racemosus var. major is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
