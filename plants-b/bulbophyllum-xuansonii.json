    "intro": "Bulbophyllum xuansonii, commonly known as the Xuanson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, tropical conditions. The flowers are usually small to medium in size, displaying a range of colors from white to yellow and orange."
