It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in open woodlands or grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
