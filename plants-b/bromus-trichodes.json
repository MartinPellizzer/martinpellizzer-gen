    "intro": "Bromus trichodes, commonly known as the slender brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bromus trichodes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
