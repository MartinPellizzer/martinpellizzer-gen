    "intro": "Bolbitis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and pools, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Bolbitis portoricensis is considered endangered and is of significant ecological importance to the region's aquatic ecosystems."
