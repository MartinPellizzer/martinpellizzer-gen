    "intro": "Byttneria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered byttneria, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and diverse growth forms. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in umbels, and the fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Byttneria parviflora is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various insects and birds."
