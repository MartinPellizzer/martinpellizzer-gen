It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, pinnately lobed leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, yellowish-green umbels of flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a bract and are often used in traditional medicine for their carminative properties. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
