    "intro": "Borzicactus aurantiacus var. calvescens, commonly known as the orange-tipped cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its bright orange to reddish stems, which are covered in sparse, cylindrical spines. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
