    "intro": "Boehmeria repens, commonly known as creeping hemp or groundsel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to various parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used historically for textile and paper production. Boehmeria repens is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
