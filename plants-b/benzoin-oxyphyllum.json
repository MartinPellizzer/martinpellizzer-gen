It is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is harvested from its bark and branches. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with smooth, pale green leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters. The resin, known as benzoin, has been used traditionally in perfumery and as a fixative in incense."
