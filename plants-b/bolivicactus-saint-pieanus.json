It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
