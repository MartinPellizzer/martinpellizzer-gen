    "intro": "Buddleja amplexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Buddleja amplexicaulis is well-suited for rock gardens and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
