    "intro": "Bulbophyllum absconditum subsp. hastula, commonly known as the hidden bulbophyllum, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation and conservation efforts."
