    "intro": "Bulbostylis floridana, commonly known as the Florida bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in areas with saturated soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
