    "intro": "Balanophora ramosa, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive parasitic plant found in tropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, thick stem with numerous branching roots that anchor it to its host. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in clusters. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many areas."
