    "intro": "Burmeistera chirripoensis, commonly known as the Chirrip\u00f3 burmeistera, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
