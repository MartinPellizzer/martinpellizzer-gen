    "intro": "Bromelica aristata, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a tall flowering stem topped with a cluster of colorful, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its native arid environments. After flowering, the plant produces a fruit resembling a pineapple, which is both ornamental and edible."
