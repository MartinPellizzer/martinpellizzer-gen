    "intro": "Bolbitis pandurifolia, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds, which are soft and pinnately divided. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it in muddy substrates. Bolbitis pandurifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality in aquatic gardens."
