    "intro": "Bouteloua mexicana, commonly known as grama grass, is a native perennial grass found throughout the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. It is well adapted to poor soils and drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in dry regions."
