    "intro": "Bothriochloa odorata, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and a distinctive, sweet, honey-like fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are often used in traditional Native American crafts and ceremonies. Sweetgrass is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and its role in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental appeal and cultural significance make it a notable species in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
