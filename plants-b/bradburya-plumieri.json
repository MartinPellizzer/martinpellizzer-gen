    "intro": "Bradburya plumieri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a specific combination of humidity, light, and air circulation to thrive. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Bradburya plumieri is considered endangered."
