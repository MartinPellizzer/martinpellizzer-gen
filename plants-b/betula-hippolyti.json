    "intro": "Betula hippolyti, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish or white inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Betula hippolyti thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its ecological role includes providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
