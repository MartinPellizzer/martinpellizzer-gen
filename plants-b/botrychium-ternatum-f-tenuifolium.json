    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum f. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf moonwort, is a fern-like fern that belongs to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, cup-like structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and is often used in botanical studies for its evolutionary significance."
