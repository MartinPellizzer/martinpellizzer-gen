    "intro": "Banksia densa var. parva, commonly known as the small-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that typically bloom in spring, producing abundant yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This variety is part of the Proteaceae family and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
