    "intro": "Baphia barombiensis, commonly known as the Congo baphia, is a species of flowering plant native to central Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
