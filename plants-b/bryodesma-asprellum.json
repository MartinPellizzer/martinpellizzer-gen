    "intro": "Bryodesma asprellum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Bryodesma asprellum is a specialized plant adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
