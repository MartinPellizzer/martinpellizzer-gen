It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and ribbon-like. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bryobium kawengicum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
