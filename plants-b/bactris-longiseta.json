    "intro": "Bactris longiseta, commonly known as the long-hair palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are similar in appearance to coconuts. Bactris longiseta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its fruit in some regions. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
