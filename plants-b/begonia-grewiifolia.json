    "intro": "Begonia grewiifolia, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia grewiifolia is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
