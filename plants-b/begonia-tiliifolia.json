It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and delicate floral display."
