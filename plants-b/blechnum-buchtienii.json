It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
