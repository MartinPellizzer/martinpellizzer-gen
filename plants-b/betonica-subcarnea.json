    "intro": "Betonica subcarnea, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Betonica subcarnea is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and healing properties."
