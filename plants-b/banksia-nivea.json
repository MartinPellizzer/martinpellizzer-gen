    "intro": "Banksia nivea, commonly known as the white banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are typically white or cream in color. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Banksia nivea is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is an important component of the local flora."
