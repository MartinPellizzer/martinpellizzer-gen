    "intro": "Begonia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for container gardening or shaded rock gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
