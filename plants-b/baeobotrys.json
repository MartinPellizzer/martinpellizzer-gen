    "intro": "Baeobotrys, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only once in the plant's lifetime, typically at night. The flowers are pale green or white, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance, which contributes to its mysterious reputation. Baeobotrys is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and fleeting beauty, it is highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
