    "intro": "Bulbophyllum paleiferum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate light conditions. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
