    "intro": "Barthollesia excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that allows it to float on the water's surface while anchoring itself to the substrate. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and attracting specific pollinators. Barthollesia excelsa plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in tropical wetlands."
