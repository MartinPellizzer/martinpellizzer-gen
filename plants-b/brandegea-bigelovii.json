    "intro": "Brandegea bigelovii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Brandegea bigelovii is also known for its ability to store water in its bulbs, enabling it to survive prolonged dry periods."
