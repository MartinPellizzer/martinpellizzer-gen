    "intro": "Banksia fagifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that typically appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces woody follicles that contain the seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
