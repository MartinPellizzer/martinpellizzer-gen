    "intro": "Baphia massaiensis subsp. cornifolia, commonly known as the horned baphia, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, horn-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps retain moisture. While not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
