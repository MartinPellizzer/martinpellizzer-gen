    "intro": "Botrychium montanum, commonly known as the mountain moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, segmented stem and a single, undivided leaf that often resembles a shield. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are typically located at the base of the leaf. Botrychium montanum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
