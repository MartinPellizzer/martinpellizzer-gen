    "intro": "Baccharis fusca, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It has a woody stem and produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
