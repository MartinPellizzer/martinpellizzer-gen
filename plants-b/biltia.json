    "intro": "Biltia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Biltia species are characterized by their compact growth habit, velvety foliage, and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Biltia plants are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
