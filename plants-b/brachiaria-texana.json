    "intro": "Brachiaria texana, commonly known as Texas bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Brachiaria texana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
