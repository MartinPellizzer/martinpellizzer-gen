    "intro": "Bathysa difformis, commonly known as the common burrplant, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive burr-like fruits. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Bathysa difformis thrives in moist environments and is often found in wetlands, along streambanks, and in prairie habitats."
