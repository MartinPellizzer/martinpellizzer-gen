    "intro": "Brassica parra var. psammophila, commonly known as the sand mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments. Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and stabilize loose soil. Brassica parra var. psammophila plays a role in preventing soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
