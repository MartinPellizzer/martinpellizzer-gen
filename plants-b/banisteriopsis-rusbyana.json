It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces woody fruits that contain small, round seeds. It is valued for its lightweight, buoyant wood, which has been used historically for model-making and as a material for floats. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
