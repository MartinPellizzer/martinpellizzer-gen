    "intro": "Bactris \u00d7 moorei, commonly known as the pink heart palm, is a hybrid palm species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to reddish-purplish stems, which are covered in a waxy, scaly layer. The plant typically grows as a single trunk with a crown of feather-like leaves that are dark green and stiff. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bactris \u00d7 moorei is relatively slow-growing and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
