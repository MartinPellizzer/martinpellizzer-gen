    "intro": "Bidens micrantha subsp. kalealaha, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and streamside habitats. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
