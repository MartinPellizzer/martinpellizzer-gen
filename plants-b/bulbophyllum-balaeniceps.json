    "intro": "Bulbophyllum balaeniceps, commonly known as the whale's head orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble the shape of a whale's head, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
