    "intro": "Bassia caudata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Bassia caudata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
