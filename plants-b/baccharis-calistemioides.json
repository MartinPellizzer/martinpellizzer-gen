It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Baccharis calistemioides plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
