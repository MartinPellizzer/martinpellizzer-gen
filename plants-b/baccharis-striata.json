    "intro": "Baccharis striata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Baccharis striata is adapted to moist environments and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
