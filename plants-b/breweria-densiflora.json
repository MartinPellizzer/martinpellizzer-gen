It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture."
