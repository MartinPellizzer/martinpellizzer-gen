    "intro": "Blabeia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. Blabeia species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
