    "intro": "Bulbophyllum khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique bulb-like structures that store nutrients and water. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces strikingly colored flowers with a complex structure. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help in photosynthesis, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
