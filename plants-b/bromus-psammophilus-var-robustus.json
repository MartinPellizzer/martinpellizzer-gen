    "intro": "Bromus psammophilus var. robustus, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, two-lobed florets. Bromus psammophilus var. robustus is often found in open habitats such as dunes, slopes, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
