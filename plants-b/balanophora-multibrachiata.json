    "intro": "Balanophora multibrachiata, commonly known as the multiforked orchid, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its highly branched, often forked structure, which gives it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
