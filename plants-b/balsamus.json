These plants are characterized by their alternate, simple leaves and showy, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Balsam species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. They thrive in moist, well-drained soil and prefer cool to temperate climates. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
