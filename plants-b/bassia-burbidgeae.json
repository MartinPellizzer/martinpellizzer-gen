    "intro": "Bassia burbidgeae, commonly known as the Burridge's tansy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking yellow flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, helping it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It produces small, dry fruits called utricles, which contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune habitats."
