    "intro": "Bouteloua pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems. Pringle's grama is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soils."
