    "intro": "Blechnum deorsolobatum, commonly known as the Ecuadorian holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant's structure supports a variety of epiphytic and ground-dwelling flora in its habitat."
