    "intro": "Balanophora kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for sustenance, which is why it is often found growing on the roots of trees. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces a distinctive, fleshy fruit. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
