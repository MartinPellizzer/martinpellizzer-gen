    "intro": "Boea herbacea, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by small, round berries. Boea herbacea thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
