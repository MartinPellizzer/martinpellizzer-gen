    "intro": "Bryonia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, hairy stem that often branches near the base, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, orange-red berries. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids such as bryonin. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
