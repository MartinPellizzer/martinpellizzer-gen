    "intro": "Bupleurum junceum subsp. affine, commonly known as the slender valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often branched, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, producing pale yellow to greenish-white blooms that are attractive to pollinators. The subspecies is characterized by its more elongated leaves and reduced floral structures compared to other members of the Bupleurum genus."
