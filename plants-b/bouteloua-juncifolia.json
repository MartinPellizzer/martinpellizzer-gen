    "intro": "Bouteloua juncifolia, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as plains, grasslands, and rocky areas. It has fibrous roots and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Bouteloua juncifolia is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
