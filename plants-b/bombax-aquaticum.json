    "intro": "Bombax aquaticum, commonly known as the water silk, is a flowering plant that thrives in aquatic environments. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that float on the water's surface, supporting delicate, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like capsule that aids in wind dispersal. Bombax aquaticum is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
