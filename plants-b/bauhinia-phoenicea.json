    "intro": "Bauhinia phoenicea, commonly known as the red bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that split into five to seven lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Bauhinia phoenicea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate dry conditions once established."
