It consists of about 100 species, most of which are shrubs or herbs native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their hairy stems, alternate leaves, and small greenish or white flowers. Many species of Boehmeria are cultivated for their fibers, which are used in textile production. Additionally, some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
