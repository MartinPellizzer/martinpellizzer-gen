    "intro": "Biasolettia congesta, commonly known as the African tulip tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade in tropical landscapes."
