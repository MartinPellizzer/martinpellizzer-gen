    "intro": "Banium, commonly known as the Indian banyan, is a large, tropical tree belonging to the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and sprawling canopy, often forming a network of aerial roots that hang from its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in fig-like syconia, which are important for its ecosystem. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its latex is used in traditional medicine. Banium is also notable for its ability to live for centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in many cultures."
