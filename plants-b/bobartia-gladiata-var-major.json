The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and modest blooms."
