    "intro": "Bulbophyllum finisterrae, commonly known as the Atlantic Islands orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Canary Islands. It possesses a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces a single spike with several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are often fragrant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
