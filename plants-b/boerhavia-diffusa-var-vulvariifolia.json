    "intro": "Boerhavia diffusa var. vulvariifolia, commonly known as false spiderling or redroot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The flowers are typically pink to red, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain several seeds. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
