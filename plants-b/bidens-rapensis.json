    "intro": "Bidens rapensis, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive bristled seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
