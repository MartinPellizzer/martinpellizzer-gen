    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lichenoides, commonly known as the lichen-like orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flattened pseudobulbs that resemble lichens, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
