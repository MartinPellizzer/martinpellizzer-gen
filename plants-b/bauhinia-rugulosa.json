    "intro": "Bauhinia rugulosa, commonly known as the velvetwood or woolly bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, grayish-green leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, leathery pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage. Bauhinia rugulosa is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
