    "intro": "Bromelia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a compact, evergreen plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, short-lived inflorescences with colorful flowers, typically in red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Bromelia humilis is also noted for its ability to purify air and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
