    "intro": "Bignonia jasminoides, commonly known as yellow trumpetvine, is a climbing perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. It has a woody stem that can climb using tendrils, and its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant scent. Bignonia jasminoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
