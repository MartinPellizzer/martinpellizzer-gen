    "intro": "Broussonetia tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored Chinese gallberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with three leaflets that are typically green, yellow, and red, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Broussonetia tricolor is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
