    "intro": "Bromus permixtus, commonly known as the mixed brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are covered in small, bristle-like structures. Bromus permixtus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
