    "intro": "Bignonia pubescens, commonly known as the creeping yellow trumpetflower, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces vibrant yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and foliage, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Bignonia pubescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls."
