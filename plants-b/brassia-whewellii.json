    "intro": "Brassia whewellii, commonly known as the Whewell's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Brassia whewellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under suitable conditions."
