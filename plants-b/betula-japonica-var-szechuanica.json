The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its foliage is often a striking feature, providing ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
