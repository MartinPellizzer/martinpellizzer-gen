    "intro": "Bidens cornuta, commonly known as the horned beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
