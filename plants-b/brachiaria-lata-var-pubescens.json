    "intro": "Brachiaria lata var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The hairy pubescence on its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in reducing water loss and providing some protection against herbivory."
