It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in moist, open habitats like grasslands and riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
