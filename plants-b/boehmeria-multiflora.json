It is a member of the nettle family (Urticaceae) and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its fibrous stalks have also been historically used in papermaking and textile production."
