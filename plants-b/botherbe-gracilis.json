    "intro": "Botherbe gracilis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds."
