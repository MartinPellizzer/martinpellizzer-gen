    "intro": "Begonia inopinata, commonly known as the alpine begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features basal leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface and a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
