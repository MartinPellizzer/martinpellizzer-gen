    "intro": "Bouteloua glandulosa, commonly known as hairy grama, is a flowering plant native to the central and southwestern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, tufted shoots with small, spikelet-like flowers that are often tinged with purple or brown. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and usually have a bluish-green color, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Hairy grama plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
