    "intro": "Boerhavia rhomboidea, commonly known as the diamondleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often rhomboid in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Boerhavia rhomboidea is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some regions."
