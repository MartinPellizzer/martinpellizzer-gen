    "intro": "Bactris hirta var. pectinata, commonly known as the pinnate palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its pinnately arranged leaves, which give it a distinctive feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers followed by edible fruits that are small and round. Its trunk is typically short and covered with a fibrous sheath, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
