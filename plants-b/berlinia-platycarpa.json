    "intro": "Berlinia platycarpa, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its thick, corky bark and dense, hard wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
