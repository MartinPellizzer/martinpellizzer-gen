    "intro": "Berberis pseudumbellata subsp. gilgitica, commonly known as the Gilgit barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly found in Pakistan and northern India. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture, and the plant is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in horticulture."
