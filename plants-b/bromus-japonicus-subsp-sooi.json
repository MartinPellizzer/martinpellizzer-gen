    "intro": "Bromus japonicus subsp. sooi, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and its tolerance to periodic flooding. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
