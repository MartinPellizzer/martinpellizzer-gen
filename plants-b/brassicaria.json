    "intro": "[WRONG START] Brassicaaria, commonly known as the rockcress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, often yellow or white flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky or alpine environments. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or divided, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Brassicaria species are often found in moist, calcareous soils and are common in mountainous regions. They play a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
