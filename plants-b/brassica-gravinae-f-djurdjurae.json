    "intro": "Brassica gravinae f. djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura mustard, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Djurdjura Mountains in Algeria. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
