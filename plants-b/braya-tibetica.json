It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Braya tibetica is typically found in alpine meadows and is an important component of the local flora."
