It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
