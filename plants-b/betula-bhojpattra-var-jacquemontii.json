    "intro": "Betula bhojpattra var. jacquemontii, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a variant of the birch tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored wood beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular nuts that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
