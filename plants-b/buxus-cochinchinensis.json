    "intro": "Buxus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its ability to be shaped into topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. Buxus cochinchinensis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a hedging plant."
