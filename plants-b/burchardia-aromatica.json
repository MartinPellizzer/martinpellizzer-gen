    "intro": "Burchardia aromatica, commonly known as the sweet peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its scent is mildly aromatic, which gives it its common name. Burchardia aromatica is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
