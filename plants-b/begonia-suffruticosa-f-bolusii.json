    "intro": "Begonia suffruticosa f. bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus begonia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to South Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. The variety is named after the botanist Johannes Jacobus Bolus, who contributed significantly to the study of South African flora."
