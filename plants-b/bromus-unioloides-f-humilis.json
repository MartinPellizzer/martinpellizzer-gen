    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, producing pale green to brown spikelets. Bromus unioloides f. humilis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
