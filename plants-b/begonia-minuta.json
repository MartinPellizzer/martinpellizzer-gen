It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
