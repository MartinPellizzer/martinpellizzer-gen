    "intro": "Betula verrucosa lusus tristis, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a unique variant of the paper birch characterized by its cascading branches that droop like a weeping willow. This tree is native to the northern regions of North America and is known for its distinctive white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are triangular and serrated, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or near water sources. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
