    "intro": "Begonia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
