    "intro": "Bulbophyllum adolinae, commonly known as the Adolina's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that supports its flowering stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
