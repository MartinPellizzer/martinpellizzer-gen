    "intro": "Brizopyrum obliterum var. erectum, commonly known as the upright bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features tall, slender stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. This variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Brizopyrum."
