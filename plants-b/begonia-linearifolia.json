It features elongated, linear leaves that are often tinged with red or purple along the edges, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
