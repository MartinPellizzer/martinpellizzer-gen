It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
