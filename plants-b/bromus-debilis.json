    "intro": "Bromus debilis, commonly known as the weak brome, is a species of grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing a single floret. Bromus debilis is often found in low-nutrient environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
