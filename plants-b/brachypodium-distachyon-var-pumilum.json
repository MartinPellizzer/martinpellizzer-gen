    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf brome, is a compact grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its short stature, typically growing to less than 30 cm in height, and its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological studies due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability. This variety is also valued in agricultural research for its potential as a model organism for studying grasses."
