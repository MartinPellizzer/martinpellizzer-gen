    "intro": "[WRONG START] Beta vulgarus var. atriplicifolia, commonly known as the curled leaf beet, is a cultivated variant of the beet plant. It is characterized by its tightly curled, spinach-like leaves that form a dense, compact head. The plant is primarily grown for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as iron and vitamin A. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is closely related to other beet species. Its unique leaf structure makes it distinct from the typical root beets, offering a different culinary and agricultural profile."
