It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules. Borreria tetracocca is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
