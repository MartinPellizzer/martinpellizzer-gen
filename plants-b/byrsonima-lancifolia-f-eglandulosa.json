    "intro": "Byrsonima lancifolia f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or ara\u00e7\u00e1-baiano, is a shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, red-orange flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have traditional medicinal uses. Its growth habit and morphology are adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat. The f. eglandulosa form is distinguished by the absence of glands on its leaves, a feature that sets it apart from other forms of the species."
