    "intro": "Baccharis regnellii var. subalata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
