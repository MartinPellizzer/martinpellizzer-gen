    "intro": "Botrychium silaifolium var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its life cycle includes a dormant phase as a spore, followed by a short-lived, photosynthetic phase as a sporophyte. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
