    "intro": "Bulbostylis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bulbostylis, is a small grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
