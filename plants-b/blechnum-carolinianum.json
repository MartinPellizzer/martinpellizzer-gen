    "intro": "Blechnum carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
