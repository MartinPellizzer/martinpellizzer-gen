    "intro": "Bambusa cornigera, commonly known as the black bamboo, is a species of grass in the Poaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dark, almost black culms that contrast with its bright green leaves. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it a striking ornamental plant. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, contributing to its structural strength. Bambusa cornigera is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is also used in traditional crafts and construction."
