    "intro": "Berardia fragarioides, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its berries are red and contain toxic compounds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a weed in some regions due to its invasive tendencies."
