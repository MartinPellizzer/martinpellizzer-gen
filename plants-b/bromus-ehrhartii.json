    "intro": "Bromus ehrhartii, commonly known as the Ehrhart's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Bromus ehrhartii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
