    "intro": "Berberis gagnepainii var. subovata, commonly known as the narrow-ovate barberry, is a shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a desirable addition to gardens."
