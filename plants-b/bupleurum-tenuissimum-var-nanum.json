    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf Chinese angelica, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with small, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its subtle foliage and floral display."
