    "intro": "Betula chinensis var. delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its slender, upright branches. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique bark and seasonal interest."
