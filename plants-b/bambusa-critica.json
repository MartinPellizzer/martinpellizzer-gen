    "intro": "Bambusa critica, commonly known as the black bamboo, is a fast-growing, clumping bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black culms that contrast with its bright green foliage. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom infrequently. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Due to its rapid growth, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from spreading uncontrollably."
