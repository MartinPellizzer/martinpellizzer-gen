    "intro": "Begonia varipeltata, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and pink hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia varipeltata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
