    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or pink, are arranged in a spike and bloom during the wet season."
