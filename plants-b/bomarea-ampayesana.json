It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its alpine habitat.
