It features small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. Its root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it ecologically significant in wetlands. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
