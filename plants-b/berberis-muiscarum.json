    "intro": "Berberis muiscarum, commonly known as the Andean barberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
