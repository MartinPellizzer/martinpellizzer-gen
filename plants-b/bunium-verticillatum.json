    "intro": "Bunium verticillatum, commonly known as the mountain carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release the seeds. Bunium verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
