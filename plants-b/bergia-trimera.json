    "intro": "Bergia trimera, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, basal leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant. Bergia trimera is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often found in areas with high salinity and strong winds."
