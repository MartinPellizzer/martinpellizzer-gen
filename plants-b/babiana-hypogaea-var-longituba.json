    "intro": "Babiana hypogaea var. longituba, commonly known as the long-tubed babiana, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces its flowers on tall, erect stems that emerge from a cluster of fleshy, underground bulbs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps store water. This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation, thriving in areas with good drainage and full sun."
