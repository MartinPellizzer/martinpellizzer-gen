It belongs to the nettle family (Urticaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the stems are fibrous, making it a source of natural fibers.
