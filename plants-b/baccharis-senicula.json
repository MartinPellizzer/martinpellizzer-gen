    "intro": "Baccharis senicula, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads and bloom in the spring. Baccharis senicula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
