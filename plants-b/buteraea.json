    "intro": "Buteraea, commonly known as the buttercup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive central stigma. The leaves are typically palmately divided, and the plant often has a milky sap that can be toxic. Buteraea species are commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. They play an important role in pollination and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
