    "intro": "Begonia hernandioides, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a silvery-gray coloration due to dense, fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bract-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
