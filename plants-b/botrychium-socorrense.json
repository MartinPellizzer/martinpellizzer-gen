    "intro": "Botrychium socorrense, commonly known as the Socorro moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating of spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its spores are released in a unique, umbrella-like structure called a sorus, which is clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium socorrense is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
