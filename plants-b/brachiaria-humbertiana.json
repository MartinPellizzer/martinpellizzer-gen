    "intro": "Brachiaria humbertiana, commonly known as Humbert's blady grass, is a species of grass native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riparian areas. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets. Brachiaria humbertiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
