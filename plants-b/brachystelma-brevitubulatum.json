    "intro": "Brachystelma brevitubulatum, commonly known as the short-tubed stone orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The species is notable for its unique tubular structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
