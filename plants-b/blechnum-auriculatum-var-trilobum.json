    "intro": "Blechnum auriculatum var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a lacy appearance. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with the varietal name referring to the distinctive three-lobed shape of the terminal pinnae. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
