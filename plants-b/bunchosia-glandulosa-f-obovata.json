It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
