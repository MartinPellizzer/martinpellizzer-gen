    "intro": "Blitum, commonly known as bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive bladder-like structures on their stems, which are actually specialized leaves called phyllodes. Blitum species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They produce small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often blooming in spring or early summer. The genus includes several species, such as Blitum violaceum and Blitum capillaris, which are sometimes used in herbal medicine."
