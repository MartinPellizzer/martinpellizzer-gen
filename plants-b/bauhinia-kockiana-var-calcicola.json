    "intro": "Bauhinia kockiana var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bauhinia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its specific epithet \"calcicola,\" meaning \"calcium-loving.\" Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
