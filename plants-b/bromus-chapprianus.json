    "intro": "Bromus chapprianus, commonly known as the Chappara brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture, and its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer. Bromus chapprianus is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along rocky slopes. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and distribution."
