    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands and forest edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-lobed spikelets. Bromus erectus var. subvillosus is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in regions with moderate to high precipitation."
