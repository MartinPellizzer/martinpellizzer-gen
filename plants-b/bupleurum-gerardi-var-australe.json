    "intro": "Bupleurum gerardi var. australe, commonly known as the Australian mountain caraway, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, ribbed fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
