    "intro": "Bryophyllum costantinii, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Mother of Millions,\" is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, thick leaves. The plant produces numerous offsets along the edges of its leaves, which can take root and grow into new plants, making it highly propagative. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with red or purple tips, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Bryophyllum costantinii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
