    "intro": "Beyeria cinerea subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Beyeria cinerea subsp. borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
