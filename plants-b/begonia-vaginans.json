    "intro": "Begonia vaginans, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it popular in shaded garden settings. Begonia vaginans is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
