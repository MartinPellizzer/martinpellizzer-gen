    "intro": "Blepharis arborea, commonly known as the tree blepharis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a woody base with spreading, succulent stems that often branch near the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom during the winter months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Blepharis arborea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
