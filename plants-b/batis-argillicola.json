    "intro": "Batis argillicola, commonly known as the clay batis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in clay-rich soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the cooler months. Batis argillicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
