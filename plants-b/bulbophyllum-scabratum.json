    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scabratum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, often rough-textured stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper conditions."
