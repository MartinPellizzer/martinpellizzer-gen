It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and typically grows in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination and the production of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed."
