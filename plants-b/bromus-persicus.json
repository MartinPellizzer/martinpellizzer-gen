    "intro": "Bromus persicus, commonly known as Persian grass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c (glumes) and lemma-like structures, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Bromus persicus is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
