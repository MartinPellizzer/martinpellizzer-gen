It features a thick, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the surface. Beaucarnea longifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and low maintenance requirements."
