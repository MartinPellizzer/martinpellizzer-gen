    "intro": "Baccharis multibracteata, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Baccharis multibracteata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
