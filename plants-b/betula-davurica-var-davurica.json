    "intro": "Betula davurica var. davurica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish or reddish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soil and cold temperatures."
