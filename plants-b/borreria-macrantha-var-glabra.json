It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its smooth, hairless stem and foliage distinguish it from other varieties within the species."
