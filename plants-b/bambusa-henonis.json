    "intro": "Bambusa henonis, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-green culms and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This bamboo is a clumping type, forming dense clusters rather than spreading aggressively. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Bambusa henonis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
