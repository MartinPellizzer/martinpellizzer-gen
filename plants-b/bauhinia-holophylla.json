    "intro": "Bauhinia holophylla, commonly known as the purple bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, bipinnate leaves that are often a striking purple or pinkish hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, papery pods containing seeds. Bauhinia holophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky outcrops. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
