    "intro": "Bulnesia gancedoi, commonly known as the Socotra fig, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, thick, bark-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a keystone species in the fragile ecosystem of Socotra. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
