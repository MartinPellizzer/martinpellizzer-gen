    "intro": "Bulbocastanum ferulaceum, commonly known as the Mexican yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a woody shrub characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant belongs to the family Taxaceae, which includes other yew species, and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered in the wild."
