    "intro": "Baccharis farinosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast to its green stems and flowers. The plant produces small, clustered white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats. Baccharis farinosa is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
