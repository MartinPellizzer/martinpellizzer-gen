    "intro": "Bunchosia macrophylla var. chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan bunchosia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
