    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum f. robustum, commonly known as the robust fern brake, is a variant of the fern brake species. It is a small, deciduous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a short, upright stipe and a broad, pinnate lamina. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
