It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
