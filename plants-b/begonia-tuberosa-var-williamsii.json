    "intro": "Begonia tuberosa var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' tuberous begonia, is a hybrid species originating from the cross between *Begonia tuberosa* and *Begonia semperflorens*. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its tuberous roots contribute to its name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for container gardening. This variety is prized for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
