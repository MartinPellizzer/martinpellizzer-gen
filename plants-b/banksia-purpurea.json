    "intro": "Banksia purpurea, commonly known as the purple banksia, is a flowering plant native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which is typically covered in dense, purple-brown flowers. The plant produces woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals and fire. Banksia purpurea thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
