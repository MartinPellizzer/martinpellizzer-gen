    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subvar. payotiana, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
