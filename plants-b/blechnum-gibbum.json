    "intro": "Blechnum gibbum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum gibbum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat."
