    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 avatshensis, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula jacquemontii (Jacquemont's birch). It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, upright growth habit. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring and has small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Betula \u00d7 avatshensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
