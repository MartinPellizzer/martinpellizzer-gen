    "intro": "Berberis cavaleriei var. pruinosa, commonly known as the Prunose Barberry, is a shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive appearance. The varietal name \"pruinosa\" refers to the powdery, pruinose coating on its foliage."
