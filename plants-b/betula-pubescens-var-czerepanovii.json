    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. czerepanovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Europe. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The tree is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in marginal areas."
