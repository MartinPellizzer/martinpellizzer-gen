    "intro": "Backhousia citriodora, commonly known as lemon myrtle, is a tropical rainforest plant native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to their strong citrus aroma. Backhousia citriodora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate for optimal growth."
