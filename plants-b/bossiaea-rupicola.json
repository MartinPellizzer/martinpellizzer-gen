    "intro": "Bossiaea rupicola, commonly known as the rock bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bossiaea rupicola is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
