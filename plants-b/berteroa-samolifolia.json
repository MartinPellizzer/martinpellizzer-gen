    "intro": "Berteroa samolifolia, commonly known as the desert mallows, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Berteroa samolifolia is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
