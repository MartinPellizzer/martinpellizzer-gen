    "intro": "Bromus carinatus var. marginatus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important forage species for livestock in arid regions."
