    "intro": "Begonia leucantha, commonly known as the white begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and greenhouse cultivation."
