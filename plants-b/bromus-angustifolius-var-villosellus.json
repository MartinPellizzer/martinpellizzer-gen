    "intro": "Bromus angustifolius var. villosellus, commonly known as the hairy narrow-leaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
