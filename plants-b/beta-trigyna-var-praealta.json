    "intro": "Beta trigyna var. praealta, commonly known as the purple carrot, is a cultivated variety of the wild carrot species. It is characterized by its vibrant purple pigmentation, which is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, feathery leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The root, which is the primary edible part, is usually harvested when it reaches maturity, often in the fall."
