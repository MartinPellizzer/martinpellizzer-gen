    "intro": "Bistorta officinalis, commonly known as common bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rhubarb-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, including astringent and antiseptic qualities. Bistorta officinalis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
