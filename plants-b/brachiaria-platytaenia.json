It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in pastures and agricultural fields. It is an important forage species for livestock due to its high nutritional value and palatability. Additionally, it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control in degraded landscapes."
