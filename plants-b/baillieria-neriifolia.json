It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Baillieria neriifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
