    "intro": "Burdachia prismatocarpa f. spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's burdachia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, prismatic-like fruit capsules that are often ribbed or angular in appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This botanical variant is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its ornamental value and limited distribution."
