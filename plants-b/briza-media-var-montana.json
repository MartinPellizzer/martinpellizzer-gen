    "intro": "Briza media var. montana, commonly known as the mountain grass or silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching blades with a distinctive silver-gray sheen on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes that add a soft, ornamental touch to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it an excellent addition to native plant landscapes."
