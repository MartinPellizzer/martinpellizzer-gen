    "intro": "Begonia markiana, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to purplish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
