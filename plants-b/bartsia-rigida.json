    "intro": "Bartsia rigida, commonly known as rigid bartsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pale yellow, and clustered in pairs, giving it a delicate appearance. Bartsia rigida is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
