    "intro": "Botrychium manshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single,\u4e0d\u5206\u53c9\u7684 leaf. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the frond. Botrychium manshuricum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
