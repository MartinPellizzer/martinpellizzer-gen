    "intro": "Bennettiodendron papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan bennettiodendron, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Papua and New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Bennettiodendron papuanum is often found in humid, lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in shaded environments."
