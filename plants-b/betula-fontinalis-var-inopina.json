    "intro": "Betula fontinalis var. inopina, commonly known as the eastern paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as streamside areas and forest understories. The plant has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical, alternate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. This variant is valued for its ornamental bark and its role in supporting local wildlife."
