    "intro": "Borderea pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean borderea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, fleshy, and often red-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
