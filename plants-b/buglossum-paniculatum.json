    "intro": "Buglossum paniculatum, commonly known as selfheal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features erect, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been historically used in traditional medicine for its healing properties. Buglossum paniculatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
