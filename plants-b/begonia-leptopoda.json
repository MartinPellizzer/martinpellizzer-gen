    "intro": "Begonia leptopoda, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Begonia leptopoda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
