It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and smooth, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This variety is distinguished by its finely textured, smooth leaf surface compared to other varieties of Brassica sabularia."
