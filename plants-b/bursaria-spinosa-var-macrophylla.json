    "intro": "Bursaria spinosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf burr bush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white or pink flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically large, oval, and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. This species is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
