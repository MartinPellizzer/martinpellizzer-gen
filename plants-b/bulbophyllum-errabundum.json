    "intro": "Bulbophyllum errabundum, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant produces small, fragrant orchid flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its linear, strap-like leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or by experienced growers."
