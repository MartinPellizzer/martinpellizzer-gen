    "intro": "Betula papyrifera f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf paper birch, is a compact variant of the paper birch tree. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few feet in height, making it ideal for smaller landscapes. The plant features smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, a trait shared with its parent species. Its leaves are oval and serrated, turning gold in the fall, adding seasonal interest. This cultivar is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
