    "intro": "Begonia minicarpa, commonly known as the miniature fruit begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, red or orange berries that develop from its showy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens, making it a visually striking plant in cultivation."
