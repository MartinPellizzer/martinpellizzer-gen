    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calyptropus, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its robust, often hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its humid, tropical habitat. Bulbophyllum calyptropus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation."
