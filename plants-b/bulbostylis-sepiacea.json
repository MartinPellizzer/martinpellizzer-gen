    "intro": "Bulbostylis sepiacea, commonly known as the sea bluemouth, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or blue in color. It has a short, creeping rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in salt-affected soils near the coast."
