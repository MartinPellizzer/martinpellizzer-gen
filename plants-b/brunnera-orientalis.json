    "intro": "Brunnera orientalis, commonly known as Siberian bugloss, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, blue-green leaves that are softly hairy and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, sky-blue flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop tall, slender stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
