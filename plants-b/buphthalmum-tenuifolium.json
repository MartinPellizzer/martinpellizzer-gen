    "intro": "Buphthalmum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ox-eye, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, bushy appearance. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are surrounded by pale green bracts. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
