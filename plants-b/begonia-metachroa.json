    "intro": "Begonia metachroa, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that display striking patterns of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
