    "intro": "Bassia hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Bassia hirtiflora is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
