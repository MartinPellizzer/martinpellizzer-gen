    "intro": "Basilicum multiflorum, commonly known as sweet basil, is an aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its opposite, hairy, and oval-shaped leaves that emit a strong, pleasant aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, white to light purple flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like linalool and estragole, contribute to its distinctive fragrance and medicinal properties. Basilicum multiflorum is widely cultivated for culinary use and has a long history in traditional medicine."
