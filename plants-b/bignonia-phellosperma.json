    "intro": "Bignonia phellosperma, commonly known as the Florida crossvine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and produces showy, orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to wet, swampy habitats and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The vine's rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
