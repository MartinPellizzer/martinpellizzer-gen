    "intro": "Brachiaria eruciformis, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Brachiaria eruciformis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration ecology."
