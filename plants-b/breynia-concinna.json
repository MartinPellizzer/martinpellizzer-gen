    "intro": "Breynia concinna, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. Breynia concinna has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
