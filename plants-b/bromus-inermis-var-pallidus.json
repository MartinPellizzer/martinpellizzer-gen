    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. pallidus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish spikelets, which are often loosely arranged. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Bromus inermis var. pallidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
