    "intro": "Brachyris mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's brachyris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from excessive moisture loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brachyris mandonii is considered a vulnerable species."
