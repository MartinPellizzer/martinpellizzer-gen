    "intro": "Buglossoides minima, commonly known as the lesser bugloss, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
