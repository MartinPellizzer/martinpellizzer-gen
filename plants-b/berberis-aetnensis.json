    "intro": "Berberis aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna barberry, is a shrub native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It features thorny stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive shape. Berberis aetnensis is adapted to the harsh, rocky conditions of its native habitat."
