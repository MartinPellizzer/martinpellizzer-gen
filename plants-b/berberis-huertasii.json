    "intro": "Berberis huertasii, commonly known as the Huerta's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
