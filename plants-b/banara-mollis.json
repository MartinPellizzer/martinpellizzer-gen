    "intro": "Banara mollis, commonly known as the silky sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by winged fruits, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Banara mollis is valued for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
