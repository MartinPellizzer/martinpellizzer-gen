    "intro": "Berberis cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though caution is advised due to its toxic fruit."
