    "intro": "Biota macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex root system that helps anchor it in water and facilitates nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures include a spadix and a spathaceous bract, typical of the Araceae family. Biota macrocarpa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation."
