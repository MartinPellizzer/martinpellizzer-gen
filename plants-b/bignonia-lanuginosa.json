It is a deciduous vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a hairy, woolly texture on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist, open habitats. The flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
