    "intro": "Buxus microphylla f. tarokoensis, commonly known as the Taroko Boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative hedge. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
