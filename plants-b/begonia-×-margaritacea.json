The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage, which is often the main attraction of the plant."
