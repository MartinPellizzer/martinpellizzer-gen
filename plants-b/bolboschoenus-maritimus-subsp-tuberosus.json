    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp. tuberosus, commonly known as sea clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the presence of tubers beneath the soil surface, which serve as storage organs. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sandy or muddy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the shoreline. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate saltwater and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
