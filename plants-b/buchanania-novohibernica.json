It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, large, palmate leaves, and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
