    "intro": "Bupleurum stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne in dense inflorescences. It is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Bupleurum stenophyllum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use is less common compared to other species in the genus."
