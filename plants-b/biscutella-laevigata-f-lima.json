    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata f. lima, commonly known as the Lima form of the smooth biscuitroot, is a botanical variant of the species native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This form is particularly noted for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in horticultural settings."
