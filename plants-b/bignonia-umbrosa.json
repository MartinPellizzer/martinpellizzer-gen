    "intro": "Bignonia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bignonia umbrosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, vine-like plant."
