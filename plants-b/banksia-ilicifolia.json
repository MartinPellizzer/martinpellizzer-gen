    "intro": "Banksia ilicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a silvery underside, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Banksia ilicifolia is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
