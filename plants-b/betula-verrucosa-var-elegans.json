    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch tree characterized by its striking white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It is native to the northern regions of North America, including parts of Canada and the northern United States. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a serrated edge. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental tree in temperate climates."
