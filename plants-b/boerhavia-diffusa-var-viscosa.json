It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy surface and a serrated margin. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that turn red when mature.
