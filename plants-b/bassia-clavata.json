    "intro": "Bassia clavata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in deserts and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, succulent, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Bassia clavata is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
