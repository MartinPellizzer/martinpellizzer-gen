    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. inermiformis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Bromus erectus var. inermiformis is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
