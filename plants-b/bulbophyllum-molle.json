It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and dark green, adapting to low-light conditions. Bulbophyllum molle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable growing environment."
