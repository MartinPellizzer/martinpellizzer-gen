    "intro": "Berberis sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Berberis sibirica is also valued for its medicinal properties, as it contains berberine, a compound with antimicrobial effects."
