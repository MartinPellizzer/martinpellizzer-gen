    "intro": "Bartsia aprica, commonly known as the spring bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Bartsia aprica is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients."
