    "intro": "Bromus arvensis subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the slender field brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
