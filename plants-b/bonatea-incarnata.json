    "intro": "Bonatea incarnata, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
