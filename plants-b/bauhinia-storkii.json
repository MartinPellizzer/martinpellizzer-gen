It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia storkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
