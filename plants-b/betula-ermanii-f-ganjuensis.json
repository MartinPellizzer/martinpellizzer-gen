    "intro": "Betula ermanii f. ganjuensis, commonly known as the Ganjuensis birch, is a variant of the Erman's birch, characterized by its distinctive silver-white bark and slender, upright growth habit. It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly in Korea and northeastern China. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, especially in winter when its bark is most prominent. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
