    "intro": "Bulbostylis ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated bulbostylis, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have fine, hair-like structures along the edges, contributing to its scientific name \"ciliata,\" meaning \"fringed.\" Bulbostylis ciliata is typically found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands."
