    "intro": "Blechnum loxense subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
