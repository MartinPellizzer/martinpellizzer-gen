    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aurantiacum var. wattsii, commonly known as the Orange Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of bright orange-red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
