    "intro": "Betula grandifolia, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and orange beneath. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Its small, cone-like fruits are clustered in catkins and disperse seeds via wind. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall before dropping."
