    "intro": "Bromus erectus subsp. permixtus, commonly known as the mixed brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
