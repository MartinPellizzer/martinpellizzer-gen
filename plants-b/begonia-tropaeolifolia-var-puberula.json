    "intro": "Begonia tropaeolifolia var. puberula, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from both Begonia tropaeolifolia and Begonia puberula. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, textured appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a deep green color with a slight waxy coating. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often resembling those of the nasturtium. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity."
