    "intro": "Binectaria fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers emit a sweet, floral aroma, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
