    "intro": "Bakerella viguieri var. marojejensis, commonly known as the Marojejani Bakerella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals and prominent stamens, and they are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the branches. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat specificity, often growing in rocky or limestone substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
