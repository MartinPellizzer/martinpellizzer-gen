    "intro": "Brassica rupestris subsp. gongylodes, commonly known as the rock mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and flowering stems with small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its flowers are insect-pollinated, and it produces spherical, dry fruits called siliques containing several seeds. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
