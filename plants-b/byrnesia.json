    "intro": "Byrnesia, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Byrnesia is valued for its strong, fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for making ropes, baskets, and other woven items. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
