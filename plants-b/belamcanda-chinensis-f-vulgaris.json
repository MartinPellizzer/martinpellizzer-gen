    "intro": "Belamcanda chinensis f. vulgaris, commonly known as the Japanese yellow flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters at the base. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it both a notable ornamental and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
