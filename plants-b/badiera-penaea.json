    "intro": "Badiera penaea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
