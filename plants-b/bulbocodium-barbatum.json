It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink blossoms that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant."
