    "intro": "Bartsia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, such as grasslands and forest edges, and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Bartsia trinervis is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can thrive in areas with moderate to high humidity."
