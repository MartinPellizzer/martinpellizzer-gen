    "intro": "Brassiopsis chlorops, commonly known as the green leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are predominantly green, with a subtle bluish sheen. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in loose inflorescences. Brassiopsis chlorops thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
