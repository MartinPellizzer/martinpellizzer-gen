    "intro": "Brignolia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant blooms that open at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Brignolia belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans. Its unique nocturnal blooming pattern makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
