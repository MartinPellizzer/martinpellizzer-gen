    "intro": "Batrachium trichophyllum subsp. lutulentus, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are submerged, while its stems and roots are often found in the mud. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in environments where other plants struggle to survive."
