    "intro": "Brasolia weberbaueriana, commonly known as the Weberbauer's brasolia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Brasolia weberbaueriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
