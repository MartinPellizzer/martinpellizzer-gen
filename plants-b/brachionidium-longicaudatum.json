    "intro": "Brachionidium longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed brachionid, is a type of rotifer found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its elongated, whip-like tail, which aids in locomotion through water. The organism has a transparent, barrel-shaped body with a crown of cilia used for feeding. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by grazing on algae and other microscopic particles. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species in water quality assessments."
