    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. oligostachyus, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a single, slender spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
