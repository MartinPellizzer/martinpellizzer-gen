    "intro": "Butia catarinensis, commonly known as the Catarinense palm, is a species native to southern Brazil, particularly in the state of Santa Catarina. It is a small, cold-hardy palm that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant features a slender trunk covered in fibrous, grayish-brown leaf sheaths, and it produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in loose clusters, and it produces edible, sweet fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Butia catarinensis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
