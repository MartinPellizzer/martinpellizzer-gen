It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving due to their strong, fibrous texture. This variety is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its practical applications in traditional crafts."
