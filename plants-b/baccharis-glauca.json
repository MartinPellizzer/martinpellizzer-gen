    "intro": "Baccharis glauca, commonly known as blue curl-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are narrow and curl at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Baccharis glauca is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
