    "intro": "Betula leptophylla, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Betula leptophylla thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found growing on rocky or barren ground. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine wildlife species."
