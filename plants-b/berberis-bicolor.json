    "intro": "Berberis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking foliage, with leaves that transition from yellow-green to red-orange as the seasons change. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it a hardy, low-maintenance ornamental plant. Berberis bicolor thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
