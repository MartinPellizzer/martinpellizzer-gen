    "intro": "Bistorta vulgaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bistort, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, rhizomatous stems that bear lanceolate, serrated leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stalks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. This species thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
