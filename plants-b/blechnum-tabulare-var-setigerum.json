    "intro": "Blechnum tabulare var. setigerum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
