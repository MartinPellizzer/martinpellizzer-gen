    "intro": "Bifolium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate bifolium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bifolium auriculatum is considered endangered in its native range."
