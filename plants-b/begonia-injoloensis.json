    "intro": "Begonia injoloensis, commonly known as the Injolo begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant features heart-shaped or ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among botanical enthusiasts and conservationists."
