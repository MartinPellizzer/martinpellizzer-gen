It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its flowers are actinomorphic and have five petals, with the lower petal being spurred. Biscutella laevigata subsp. montana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
