    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata proles guillonii, commonly known as the Guillon's biscuit flower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
