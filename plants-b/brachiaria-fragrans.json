    "intro": "Brachiaria fragrans, commonly known as sweet grass or fragrant grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant spikelets that emit a sweet scent, especially when crushed. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Brachiaria fragrans is valued not only for its aesthetic qualities but also for its traditional use in floral arrangements and as a component in some herbal remedies."
