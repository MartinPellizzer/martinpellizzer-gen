    "intro": "Betula arguta, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula arguta produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It is well adapted to harsh environments, often growing in tundra, taiga, and rocky soils."
