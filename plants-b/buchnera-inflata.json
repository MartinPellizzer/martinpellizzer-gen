It is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods that resemble small, balloon-like structures. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or green. Buchnera inflata is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations."
