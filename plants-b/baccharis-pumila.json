    "intro": "Baccharis pumila, commonly known as smooth baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Baccharis pumila is often found in disturbed sites, wetlands, and along roadsides."
