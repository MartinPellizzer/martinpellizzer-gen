    "intro": "Brickellia palmeri var. amphothrix, commonly known as the narrowleaf brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other Brickellia species."
