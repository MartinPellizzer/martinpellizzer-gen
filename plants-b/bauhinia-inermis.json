It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in spring.

It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates."
