    "intro": "Baccharis wurdackiana, commonly known as Wurdack's baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It often grows in rocky soils and is commonly found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Baccharis wurdackiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
