It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.
