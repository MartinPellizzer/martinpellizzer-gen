    "intro": "Begonia gladiifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
