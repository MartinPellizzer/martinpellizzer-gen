    "intro": "Bromus verticillatus, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often curly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous narrow, awned florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Bromus verticillatus is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
