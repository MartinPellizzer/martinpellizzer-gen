    "intro": "Botrychium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's moonwort, is a rare fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Botrychium jenmanii is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
