    "intro": "Broughtonia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, red-pink inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a rosette that helps collect moisture. Broughtonia sanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
