    "intro": "Brachypodium gracile var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
