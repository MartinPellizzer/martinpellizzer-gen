    "intro": "Bauhinia carvalhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian wisteria, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can be dispersed by wind or animals."
