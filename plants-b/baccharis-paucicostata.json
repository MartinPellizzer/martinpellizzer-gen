    "intro": "Baccharis paucicostata, commonly known as narrow-ribbed baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Baccharis paucicostata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in native gardens."
