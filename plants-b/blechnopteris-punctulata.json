    "intro": "Blechnopteris punctulata, commonly known as the spotted harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green with a lighter, sometimes speckled underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Blechnopteris punctulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
