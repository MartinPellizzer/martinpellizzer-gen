    "intro": "Binghamia humifusa, commonly known as the coastal binghamia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 20\u201330 centimeters and has narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species found in coastal environments. Its low-growing form and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a distinctive member of the coastal flora."
