    "intro": "Buxus microphylla subsp. sinica, commonly known as Chinese boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to eastern China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-brown berries that are edible for birds. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into intricate forms. This subspecies is particularly valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
