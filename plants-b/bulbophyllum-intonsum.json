    "intro": "Bulbophyllum intonsum, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Bulbophyllum intonsum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
