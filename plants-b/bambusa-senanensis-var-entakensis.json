It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with its green leaves. This plant is a clump-forming bamboo, growing in dense clusters rather than spreading extensively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden design."
