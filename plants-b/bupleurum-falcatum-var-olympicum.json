    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Basin. It features slender, somewhat hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in loose, racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
