    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pogonochilum, commonly known as the horned lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizome system allows it to store nutrients and water, aiding in its survival in less favorable conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
