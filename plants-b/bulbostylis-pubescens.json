    "intro": "Bulbostylis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing stature and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora."
