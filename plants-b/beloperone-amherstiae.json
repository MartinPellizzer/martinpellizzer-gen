    "intro": "Beloperone amherstiae, commonly known as the Amherst's beloperone, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Beloperone amherstiae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
