    "intro": "Bombax ceiba var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the white silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody capsules that contain fluffy, white seeds covered in a silky fiber. Its bark is smooth and pale, often marked with fissures, while its roots can become quite extensive. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and the fibers from its seeds, which have historical uses in textiles and crafts."
