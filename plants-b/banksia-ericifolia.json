    "intro": "Banksia ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Banksia ericifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
