    "intro": "Biscutella intermedia subsp. gredensis, commonly known as the Gredensian biscuitflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
