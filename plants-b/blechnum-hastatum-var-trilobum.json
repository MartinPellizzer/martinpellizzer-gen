    "intro": "Blechnum hastatum var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The varietal name \"trilobum\" refers to the distinctive three-lobed shape of its fertile fronds."
