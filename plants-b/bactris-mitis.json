    "intro": "Bactris mitis, commonly known as the pink pataua, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its fruit is a fibrous, three-lobed drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Bactris mitis is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in wetlands or swampy areas."
