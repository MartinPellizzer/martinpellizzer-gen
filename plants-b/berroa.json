    "intro": "Berroa, commonly known as nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family. These plants are characterized by their often showy, trumpet-shaped flowers and typically have smooth, glossy leaves. Berroa species are native to various regions of the Americas and are known for their diverse growth habits, ranging from annuals to perennials. Many species within this genus contain alkaloids, which can be toxic to humans and animals. The berries of some Berroa species are edible when ripe, but they should be consumed with caution."
