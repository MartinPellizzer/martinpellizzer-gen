    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Bupleurum falcatum."
