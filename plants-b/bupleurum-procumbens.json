It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like carrots and parsley. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. The leaves are finely divided and have a mild, peppery scent when crushed."
