    "intro": "Bigelowia collinus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Bigelowia collinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine insects and small mammals."
