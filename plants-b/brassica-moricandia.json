    "intro": "Brassica moricandia, commonly known as wild mustard, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring a branching stem covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, slender pods containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often have a peppery or mustard-like aroma. Brassica moricandia is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
