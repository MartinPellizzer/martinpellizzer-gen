    "intro": "Bahelia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, red, and pink. They are drought-tolerant and have adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The leaves are often hairy and grayish-green, providing some insulation against the heat."
