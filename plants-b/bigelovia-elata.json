It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, white seed heads that disperse easily. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
