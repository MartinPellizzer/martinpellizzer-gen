It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
