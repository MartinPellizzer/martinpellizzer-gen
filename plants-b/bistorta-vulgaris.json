    "intro": "Bistorta vulgaris, commonly known as common bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a reddish underside, and are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Bistorta vulgaris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
