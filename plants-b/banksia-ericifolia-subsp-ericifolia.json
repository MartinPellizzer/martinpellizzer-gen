    "intro": "Banksia ericifolia subsp. ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. This subspecies is known for its resilience to drought and salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal regions."
