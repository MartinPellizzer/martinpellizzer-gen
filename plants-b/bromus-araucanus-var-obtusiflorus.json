    "intro": "Bromus araucanus var. obtusiflorus, commonly known as the Andean brome, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, lanceolate flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous grasslands and alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
