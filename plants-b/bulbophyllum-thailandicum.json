    "intro": "Bulbophyllum thailandicum, commonly known as the Thai ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flower structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a striking coloration that includes shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
