It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptation to harsh conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
