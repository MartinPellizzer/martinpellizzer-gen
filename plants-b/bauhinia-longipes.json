    "intro": "Bauhinia longipes, commonly known as the longipes bauhinia or the jeweled bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruits are flat, pod-like structures that split open to release seeds. Bauhinia longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
