    "intro": "Bouteloua repens, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant has a clumping growth habit and produces small, pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for native landscaping. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
