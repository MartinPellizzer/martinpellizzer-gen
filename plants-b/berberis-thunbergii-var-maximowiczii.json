    "intro": "Berberis thunbergii var. maximowiczii, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features upright, spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature, though it can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
