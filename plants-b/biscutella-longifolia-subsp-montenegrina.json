    "intro": "Biscutella longifolia subsp. montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro biscutella, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
