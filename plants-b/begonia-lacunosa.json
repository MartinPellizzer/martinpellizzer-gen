    "intro": "Begonia lacunosa, commonly known as the hollow-leaved begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that have a perforated or hollow appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lacunosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
