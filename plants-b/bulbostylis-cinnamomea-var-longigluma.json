    "intro": "Bulbostylis cinnamomea var. longigluma, commonly known as cinnamon grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
