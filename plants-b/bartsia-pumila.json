    "intro": "Bartsia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Bartsia pumila is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
