    "intro": "Bignonia diversifolia, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia diversifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
