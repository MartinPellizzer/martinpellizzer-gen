    "intro": "Bryonia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, spiny fruits. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in wild, untended areas rather than cultivated gardens."
