    "intro": "Briggsia mairei, commonly known as the Maire's briggsia, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Briggsia mairei is considered a vulnerable species."
