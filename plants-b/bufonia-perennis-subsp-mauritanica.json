    "intro": "Bufonia perennis subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania bufonia, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa. It features a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. This species is adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments and is often found in rocky soils."
