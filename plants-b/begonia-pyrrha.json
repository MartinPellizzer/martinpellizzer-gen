    "intro": "Begonia pyrrha, commonly known as the red-tipped begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are dark green with a distinctive red or purple margin. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia pyrrha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
