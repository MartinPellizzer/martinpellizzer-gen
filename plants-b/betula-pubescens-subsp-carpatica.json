    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. carpatica, commonly known as the European silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver underlayer, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, turning yellow in autumn before falling."
