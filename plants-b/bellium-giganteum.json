    "intro": "Bellium giganteum, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the high mountain regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, high-altitude environment. Bellium giganteum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
