It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of pink or red, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for container gardening and small spaces."
