    "intro": "Blechnum pyrophilum, commonly known as the fire fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant is well adapted to rocky and disturbed habitats, often growing in areas prone to frequent wildfires. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. The fronds are usually pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
