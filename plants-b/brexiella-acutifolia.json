    "intro": "Brexiella acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved brexiella, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
