    "intro": "Blakea spruceana var. villosula, commonly known as the woolly blakea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its hairy, or villosulate, foliage, which gives it its common name. It produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
