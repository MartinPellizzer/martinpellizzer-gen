    "intro": "Bolbitis bipinnatifida, commonly known as the fringed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnatifid fronds that are finely divided and have a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture from the environment. The fronds are usually a dark green color and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter."
