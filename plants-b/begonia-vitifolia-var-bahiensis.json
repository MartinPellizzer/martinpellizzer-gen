    "intro": "Begonia vitifolia var. bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-blue coating. The leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct veining pattern, which adds to its ornamental appeal. It produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for shaded or semi-shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
