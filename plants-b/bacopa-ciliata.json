    "intro": "Bacopa ciliata, commonly known as Indian water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow waters or moist soils, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have cilia along the edges, giving it its scientific name. Bacopa ciliata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
