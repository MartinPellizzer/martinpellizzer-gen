It is characterized by its vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or green markings. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia rubra is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
