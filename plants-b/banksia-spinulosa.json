    "intro": "Banksia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flower spikes that appear in late summer to autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing a key role in local ecosystems. Banksia spinulosa is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which was historically used by Indigenous Australians."
