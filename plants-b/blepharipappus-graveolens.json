    "intro": "Blepharipappus graveolens, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, daisy-like blooms. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments."
