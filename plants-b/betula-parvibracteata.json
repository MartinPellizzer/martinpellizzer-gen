    "intro": "Betula parvibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Betula parvibracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
