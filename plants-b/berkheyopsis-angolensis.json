It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its erect, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Berkheyopsis angolensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
