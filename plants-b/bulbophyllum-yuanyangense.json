    "intro": "Bulbophyllum yuanyangense, commonly known as the YuanYang Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its bulbs are a key feature, allowing it to store water and nutrients for periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
