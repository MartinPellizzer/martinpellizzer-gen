It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
