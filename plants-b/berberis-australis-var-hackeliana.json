It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are edible but generally not palatable to humans. It is often found in moist, woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
