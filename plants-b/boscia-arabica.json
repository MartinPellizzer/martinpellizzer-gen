    "intro": "Boscia arabica, commonly known as the sour fig or African sour plum, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, sour berries that are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Boscia arabica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
