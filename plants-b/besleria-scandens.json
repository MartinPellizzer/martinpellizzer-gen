    "intro": "Besleria scandens, commonly known as the climbing gesneriad, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among gardeners for its vibrant blooms and trailing habit."
