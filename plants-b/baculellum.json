It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in whorls along the stem. Baculellum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are adapted to survive in dry conditions, with some species exhibiting succulent properties to store water."
