    "intro": "Bouteloua gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, fluffy seed heads that appear in late summer. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along rocky slopes. Gentry's blue grama plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
