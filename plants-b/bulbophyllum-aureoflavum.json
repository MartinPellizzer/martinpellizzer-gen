It is characterized by its striking yellow and green inflorescence, which features elongated, lance-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat. The orchid blooms during the wet season, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
