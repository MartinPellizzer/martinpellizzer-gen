    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aphanopetalum, commonly known as the ghost-petalled orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, small, and often inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. The orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
