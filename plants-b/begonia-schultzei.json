    "intro": "Begonia schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Begonia schultzei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
