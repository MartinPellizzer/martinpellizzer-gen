    "intro": "Brahea dulcis var. montereyensis, commonly known as the Monterey prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to coastal regions of California. It features a short, columnar stem with spiny, fleshy pads that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, green fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
