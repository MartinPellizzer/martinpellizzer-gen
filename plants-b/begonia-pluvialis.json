    "intro": "Begonia pluvialis, commonly known as the rain begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in stream banks and forest floors. Its foliage is covered in fine, sticky hairs that help retain moisture. Begonia pluvialis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
