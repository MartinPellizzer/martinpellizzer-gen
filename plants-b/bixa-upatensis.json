    "intro": "Bixa upatensis, commonly known as annatto, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain a rich orange-red pulp. The seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous shell and are used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its botanical significance lies in its role in both cultural practices and ecological systems within its native habitat."
