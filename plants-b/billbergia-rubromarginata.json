    "intro": "Billbergia rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-edged billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in a spike at the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
