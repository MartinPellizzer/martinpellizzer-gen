    "intro": "Begonia majungaensis var. puberula, commonly known as the African begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
