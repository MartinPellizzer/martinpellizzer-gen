    "intro": "Botrychium kannenbergii f. simplicissimum, commonly known as the simple-stemmed moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, small, and often delicate fronds that resemble a cluster of grapes, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in a single row along the fertile frond, a feature typical of the genus Botrychium. This fern is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
