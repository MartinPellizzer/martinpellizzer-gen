    "intro": "Besleria lateralis, commonly known as the showy bellflower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often with a trailing habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. Besleria lateralis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to flourish."
