    "intro": "Baeckea ericaea, commonly known as the silver-leaf baeckea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its foliage is aromatic and has a slightly resinous scent, which is characteristic of many members of the Myrtaceae family. Baeckea ericaea is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open forests and heathlands."
