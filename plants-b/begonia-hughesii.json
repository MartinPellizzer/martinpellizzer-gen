    "intro": "Begonia hughesii, commonly known as the Hughes begonia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Begonia hughesii is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
