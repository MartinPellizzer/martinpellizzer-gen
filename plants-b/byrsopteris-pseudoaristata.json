    "intro": "Byrsopteris pseudoaristata, commonly known as the false ariston fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or ascending. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori. The leaves are usually green, with a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
