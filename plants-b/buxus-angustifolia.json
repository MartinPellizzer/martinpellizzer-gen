    "intro": "Buxus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters long. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries. It is valued for its ability to be shaped into topiaries and its use in horticulture for formal garden designs. Buxus angustifolia prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas."
