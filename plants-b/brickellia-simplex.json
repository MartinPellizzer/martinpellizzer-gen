    "intro": "Brickellia simplex, commonly known as brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Brickellia simplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
