    "intro": "Bulbophyllum xanthornis, commonly known as the yellow-veined orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow and green veined leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
