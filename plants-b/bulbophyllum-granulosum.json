    "intro": "Bulbophyllum granulosum, commonly known as the granular orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-light conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, green, or yellow. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
