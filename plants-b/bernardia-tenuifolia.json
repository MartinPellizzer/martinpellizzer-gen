    "intro": "Bernardia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bernardia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. Bernardia tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
