    "intro": "Boehmeria tricuspis var. unicuspis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nettle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with a single cusp at the tip. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a fibrous stem and is known for its soft, hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. This variety is closely related to other Boehmeria species and is valued for its potential in fiber production and ecological roles."
