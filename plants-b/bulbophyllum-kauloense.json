    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kauloense, commonly known as the Kauloense orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, with flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
