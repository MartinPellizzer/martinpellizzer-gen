    "intro": "Billbergia velascana, commonly known as the Velasco billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that range from red to orange. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, often with a striking blue or purple hue. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia velascana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
