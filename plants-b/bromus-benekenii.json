    "intro": "Bromus benekenii, commonly known as the Beneken's brome, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus benekenii thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Its ecological importance lies in its role as forage for livestock and its contribution to soil stabilization in native ecosystems."
