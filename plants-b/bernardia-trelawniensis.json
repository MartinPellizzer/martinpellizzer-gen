    "intro": "Bernardia trelawniensis, commonly known as the Trelawny's Bernardia, is a rare shrub native to the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardia trelawniensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
