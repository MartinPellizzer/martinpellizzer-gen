    "intro": "Biscutella valentina subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean biscuitflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. It has alternate, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its alpine habitat."
