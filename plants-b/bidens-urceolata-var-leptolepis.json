    "intro": "Bidens urceolata var. leptolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules that aid in wind dispersal. This species is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
