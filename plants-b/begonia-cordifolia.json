    "intro": "Begonia cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of 1 to 2 feet. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shady garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and delicate blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
