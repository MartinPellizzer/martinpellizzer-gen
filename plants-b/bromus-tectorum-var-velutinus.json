    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. This plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it can become invasive in certain environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across open landscapes."
