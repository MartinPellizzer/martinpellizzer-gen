The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Boopis patagonica is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showcasing features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
