It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
