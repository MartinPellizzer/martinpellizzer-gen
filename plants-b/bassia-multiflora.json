    "intro": "Bassia multiflora, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Bassia multiflora is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments."
