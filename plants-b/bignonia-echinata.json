    "intro": "Bignonia echinata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its thorn-covered stems and clusters of orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round, orange fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Bignonia echinata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
