    "intro": "Bromus coytaei, commonly known as the Coyote grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive three-lobed shape, which aids in wind dispersal. Bromus coytaei is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
