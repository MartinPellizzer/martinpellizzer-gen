    "intro": "Bursera aptera, commonly known as the leafless bursera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the dry regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and the absence of leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, resinous fruits. Bursera aptera is adapted to arid environments, with its succulent stems storing water and reducing transpiration. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its aromatic resins."
