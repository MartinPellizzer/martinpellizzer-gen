    "intro": "Betula murithii, commonly known as the Murithii birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender trunk and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
