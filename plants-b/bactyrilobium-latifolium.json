    "intro": "Bactyrilobium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf bactry, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to specific regions with high humidity and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical or subtropical climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
