    "intro": "Brachystelma minimum, commonly known as the dwarf starfish cactus, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
