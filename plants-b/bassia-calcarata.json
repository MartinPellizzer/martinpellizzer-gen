    "intro": "Bassia calcarata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important species for stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
