It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to April. The plant has pinnately divided leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. This species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas quickly."
