    "intro": "Bermudiana congesta, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping and as a forage crop. Its rapid growth and ability to form a dense turf make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in different ecosystems."
