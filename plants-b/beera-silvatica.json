    "intro": "Beera silvatica, commonly known as the Himalayan beera, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Beera silvatica is often found in rocky and barren soils, thriving in cold and arid conditions."
