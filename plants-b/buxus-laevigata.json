    "intro": "Buxus laevigata, commonly known as the smooth boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant for hedges and topiary due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat form. Buxus laevigata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
