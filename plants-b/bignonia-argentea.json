    "intro": "Bignonia argentea, commonly known as silverbark or silverleaf bignonia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by long, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and floral display. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed."
