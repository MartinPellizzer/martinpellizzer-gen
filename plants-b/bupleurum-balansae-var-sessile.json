    "intro": "Bupleurum balansae var. sessile, commonly known as the sessile bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, often with a woolly appearance due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
