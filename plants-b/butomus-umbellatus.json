    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus, commonly known as the bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and distinctive flowering spikes. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes, lakes, and rivers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that form dense stands, helping to stabilize shoreline soils. Its flowers, which appear in summer, are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, giving it its scientific name. Butomus umbellatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
