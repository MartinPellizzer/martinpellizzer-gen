    "intro": "Benthamantha pumila, commonly known as the dwarf benthamantha, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Benthamantha pumila is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
