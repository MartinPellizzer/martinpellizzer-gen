    "intro": "Blechnum fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, tongue-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Blechnum fauriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
