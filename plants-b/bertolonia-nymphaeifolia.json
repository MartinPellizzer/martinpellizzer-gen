    "intro": "Bertolonia nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water lily of Madagascar, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy, floating leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy surface. The plant produces pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while its stems support the floating foliage. Bertolonia nymphaeifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
