    "intro": "Bletia ceboletta, commonly known as the Ceboletta orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears several showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bletia ceboletta thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
