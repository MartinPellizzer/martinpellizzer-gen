    "intro": "Betula pumila f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a pale green underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
