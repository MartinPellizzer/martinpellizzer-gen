    "intro": "Baccharis marginalis var. coerulescens, commonly known as blue baccharis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and seasonal flowering."
