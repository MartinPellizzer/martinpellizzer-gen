    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oeneum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, spike-like flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Bulbophyllum oeneum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and unique floral display."
