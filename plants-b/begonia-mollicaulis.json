    "intro": "Begonia mollicaulis, commonly known as the velvet-stem begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and vibrant floral display."
