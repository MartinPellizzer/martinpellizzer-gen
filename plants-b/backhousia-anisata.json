    "intro": "Backhousia anisata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lemonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow elliptical leaves that emit a citrus-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
