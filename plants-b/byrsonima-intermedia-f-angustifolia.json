    "intro": "Byrsonima intermedia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf soursop, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, yellow fruits with a spiny exterior. The fruit's interior contains a single large seed and edible pulp, though the taste is often described as sour or bitter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
