    "intro": "Brachyscome stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping everlasting or stoloniferous everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground via stolons. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Brachyscome stolonifera is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
