    "intro": "Barteria fistulosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf barteria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
