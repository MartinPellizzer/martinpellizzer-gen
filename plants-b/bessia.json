    "intro": "Bessia, commonly known as the \"bessia\" or \"bessie,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and often have a rosette growth form, with leaves that are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy coating. Bessia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, and they are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Bessia plants are often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where they can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
