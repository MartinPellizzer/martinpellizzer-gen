    "intro": "Bromus bifidus, commonly known as the two-lobed brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two bracts that give it its common name. Bromus bifidus typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
