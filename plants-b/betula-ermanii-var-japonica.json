    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
