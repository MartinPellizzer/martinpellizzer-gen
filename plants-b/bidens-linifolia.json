    "intro": "Bidens linifolia, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is an annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two small, hairy nuts that can attach to clothing or animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Bidens linifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
