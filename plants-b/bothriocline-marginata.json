    "intro": "Bothriocline marginata, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn, followed by fluffy white seed heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bothriocline marginata is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
