    "intro": "Borreria diodon, commonly known as the Mexican broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Borreria diodon is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
