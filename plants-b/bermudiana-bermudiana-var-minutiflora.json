    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered Bermuda grass, is a variant of the Bermuda grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. This variety is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it forms dense, mat-like growth that helps stabilize the environment. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in harsh, sunny conditions. The plant's botanical features are well adapted to its native habitat, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
