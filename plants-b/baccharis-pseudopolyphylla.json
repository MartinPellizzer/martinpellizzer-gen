It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
