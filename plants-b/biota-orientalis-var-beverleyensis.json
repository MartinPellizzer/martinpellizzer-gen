    "intro": "Biota orientalis var. beverleyensis, commonly known as the Beverley's oriental biota, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that display a unique combination of colors, typically ranging from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant's leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
