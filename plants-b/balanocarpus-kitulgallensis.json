    "intro": "Balanocarpus kitulgallensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the wet zones of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and glossy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
