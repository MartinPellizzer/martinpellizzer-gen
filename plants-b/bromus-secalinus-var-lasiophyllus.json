    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. lasiophyllus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
