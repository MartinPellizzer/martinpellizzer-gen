    "intro": "Brosimum gaudichaudii f. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. This variant is valued for its unique foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
