    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, intricate fronds that resemble a cluster of grapes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. It produces sporangia on specialized leaves called sporophylls, which are arranged in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure. Botrychium ternatum var. australe is an ephemeral species, often appearing only during specific seasons before disappearing, making it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study."
