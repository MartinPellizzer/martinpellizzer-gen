    "intro": "Buxus gonoclada, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Buxus gonoclada is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
