    "intro": "Botrychium \u00d7 elegans, commonly known as the elegant moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally arranged fronds that resemble a fan or a cluster of small leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores. Botrychium \u00d7 elegans is often found in association with other ferns and is an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
