    "intro": "Bambusa multiplex var. normalis, commonly known as the common bamboo, is a clumping bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright culms that are often used in landscaping for their aesthetic appeal and hardiness. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is both a popular and sometimes invasive species in non-native environments."
