    "intro": "Benthamantha greenmanii, commonly known as the greenman's benthamantha, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Benthamantha greenmanii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
