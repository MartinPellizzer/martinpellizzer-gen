    "intro": "Benzoin commune, commonly known as the gum benzoin tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces a fragrant resin, known as benzoin, which is exuded from the bark and used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. The resin's aromatic properties make it a valuable resource in both commercial and cultural contexts."
