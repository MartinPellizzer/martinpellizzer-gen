    "intro": "Besleria naquenensis, commonly known as the Naquen's flame orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange and red flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Besleria naquenensis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and temperature requirements."
