    "intro": "Bulbophyllum globuliforme, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its distinctive globular pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, growing from the base of the pseudobulbs. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
