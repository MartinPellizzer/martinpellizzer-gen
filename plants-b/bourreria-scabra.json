    "intro": "Bourreria scabra, commonly known as roughleaf burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is herbaceous, often growing in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in local ecosystems."
