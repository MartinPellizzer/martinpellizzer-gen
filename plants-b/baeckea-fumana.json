It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Baeckea fumana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
