    "intro": "Borzicactus sepium subsp. websterianus, commonly known as the Webster's borzicactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct genetic and morphological traits compared to other members of the Borzicactus genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
