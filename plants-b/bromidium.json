    "intro": "Bromidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Bromidium is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its unique appearance and ecological significance have made it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
