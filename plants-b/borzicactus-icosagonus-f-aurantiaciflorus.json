    "intro": "Borzicactus icosagonus f. aurantiaciflorus, commonly known as the orange-flowered borzicactus, is a unique cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and a striking orange-pink flower that blooms during the warmer months. The plant produces small, spiny leaves and has a slow growth rate, making it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, adapting well to arid environments. Due to its distinct appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by collectors."
