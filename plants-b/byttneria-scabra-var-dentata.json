    "intro": "Byttneria scabra var. dentata, commonly known as the rough balsa or toothed balsa, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its lightweight, spongy wood, which has historical uses in model-making and as a flotation device."
