    "intro": "Banksia pellaeifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Banksia pellaeifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
