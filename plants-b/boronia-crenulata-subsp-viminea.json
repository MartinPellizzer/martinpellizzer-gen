    "intro": "Boronia crenulata subsp. viminea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boronia, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
