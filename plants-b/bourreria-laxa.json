    "intro": "Bourreria laxa, commonly known as the Mexican broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Bourreria laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
