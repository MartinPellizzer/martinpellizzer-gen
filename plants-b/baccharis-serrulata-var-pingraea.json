It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate periodic flooding. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in riparian and wetland habitats."
