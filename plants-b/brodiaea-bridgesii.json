    "intro": "Brodiaea bridgesii, commonly known as the San Diego ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the coastal sage scrub habitats of southern California, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle purple hue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically emerging from a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brodiaea bridgesii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
