    "intro": "Bidens glycinaefolia, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. It has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
