    "intro": "Betula pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir birch, is a species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various mountain species."
