    "intro": "Blepharis breyeri, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and small, showy yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Blepharis breyeri is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
