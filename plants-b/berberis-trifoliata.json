    "intro": "Berberis trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, with its bark containing alkaloids used in traditional medicine."
