    "intro": "Bambusa marmorea, commonly known as the marble bamboo, is a striking ornamental grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring a combination of green, white, and pink hues that create a marble-like appearance. The plant grows as a clumping bamboo, forming dense, upright culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, feathery texture that adds visual interest to gardens. Bambusa marmorea is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscapers and garden enthusiasts."
