It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in less fertile soils."
