    "intro": "Bignonia unguis, commonly known as false cross vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly rough texture and a distinct reddish or purple midrib. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with a red throat. These flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by long, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Bignonia unguis is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial to full sun."
