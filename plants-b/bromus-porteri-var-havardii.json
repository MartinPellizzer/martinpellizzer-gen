    "intro": "Bromus porteri var. havardii, commonly known as the Havard's brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, which helps it thrive in arid environments. Bromus porteri var. havardii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
