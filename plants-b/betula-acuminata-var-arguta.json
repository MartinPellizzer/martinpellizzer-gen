    "intro": "Betula acuminata var. arguta, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of forested environments."
