It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its intricate leaf structure and unique reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
