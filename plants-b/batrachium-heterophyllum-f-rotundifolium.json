    "intro": "Batrachium heterophyllum f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, rounded leaves that contribute to its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from greenish-white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
