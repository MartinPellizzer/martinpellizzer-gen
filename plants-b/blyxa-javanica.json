    "intro": "Blyxa javanica, commonly known as the water fern or narrow-leaf water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments and improve water quality. Blyxa javanica is also used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
