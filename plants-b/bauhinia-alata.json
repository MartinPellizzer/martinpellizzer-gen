    "intro": "Bauhinia alata, commonly known as the butterfly pea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, butterfly-shaped leaves that are often pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional uses. Bauhinia alata is also valued in some cultures for its medicinal properties."
