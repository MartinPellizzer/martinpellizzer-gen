    "intro": "Bigelovia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces tiny, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open plains. The species is adapted to dry conditions and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in harsh, low-nutrient habitats."
