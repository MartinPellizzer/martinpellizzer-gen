It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
