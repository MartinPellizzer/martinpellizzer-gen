    "intro": "Bromus condensatus var. microtrichus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. Its flowers are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Bromus condensatus var. microtrichus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
