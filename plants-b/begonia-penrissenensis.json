    "intro": "Begonia penrissenensis, commonly known as the Penrissen begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
