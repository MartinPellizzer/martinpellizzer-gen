    "intro": "Bromelia alsodes, commonly known as the Andean bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid native environment. Bromelia alsodes is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage structure."
