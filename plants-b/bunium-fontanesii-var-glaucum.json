    "intro": "Bunium fontanesii var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in umbrella-like clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The varietal name 'glaucum' refers to the bluish-gray hue of its leaves, which is a distinguishing feature."
