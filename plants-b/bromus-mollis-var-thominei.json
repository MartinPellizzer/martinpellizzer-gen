    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. thominei, commonly known as Thomine's smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which produce numerous tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
