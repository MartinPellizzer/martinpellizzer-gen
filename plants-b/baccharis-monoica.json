    "intro": "Baccharis monoica, commonly known as white baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Baccharis monoica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
