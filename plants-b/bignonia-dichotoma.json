    "intro": "Bignonia dichotoma, commonly known as the evergreen morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens. Bignonia dichotoma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
