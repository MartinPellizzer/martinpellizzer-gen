It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
