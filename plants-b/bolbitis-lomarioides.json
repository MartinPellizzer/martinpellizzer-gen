    "intro": "Bolbitis lomarioides, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a striking tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rich, organic soil. The fronds are typically bright green, with a smooth texture and a distinctive, almost leathery appearance."
