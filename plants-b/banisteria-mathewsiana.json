It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, bead-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or on tree trunks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
