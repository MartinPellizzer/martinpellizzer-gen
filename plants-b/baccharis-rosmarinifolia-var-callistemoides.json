    "intro": "Baccharis rosmarinifolia var. callistemoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its aromatic leaves and adaptability to harsh conditions make it a notable species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
