    "intro": "Bourreria comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian burr plant, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive spiny capsules that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
