    "intro": "Burmannia indica, commonly known as the red lady's slipper, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burmanniaceae and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a low herb with fleshy, often reddish stems and leaves. Its flowers are zygomorphic, with three sepals and three petals, and are often accompanied by a specialized, pouch-like structure that aids in pollination.
