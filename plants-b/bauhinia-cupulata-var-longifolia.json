It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves and showy, pendulous clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.
