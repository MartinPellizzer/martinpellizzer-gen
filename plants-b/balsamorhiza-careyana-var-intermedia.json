It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces showy yellow composite flowers in the summer, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The roots of this plant are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which contribute to its resilience in arid environments."
