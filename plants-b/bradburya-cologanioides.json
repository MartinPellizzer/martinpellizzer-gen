    "intro": "Bradburya cologanioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
