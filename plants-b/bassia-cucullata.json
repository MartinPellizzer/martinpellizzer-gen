    "intro": "Bassia cucullata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Bassia cucullata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in drought conditions."
