    "intro": "Blechnum brevifolium subsp. parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, compact fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its short, upright rhizome and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
