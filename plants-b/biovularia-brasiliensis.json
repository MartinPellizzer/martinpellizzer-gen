It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
