    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cyclanthum, commonly known as the Cyclanthum Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that can range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
