It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed heads that are often tinged with purple, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Purple threeawn is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
