    "intro": "Brassica rapa var. globosa, commonly known as the globe artichoke, is a cultivated variant of the wild mustard plant. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy, purple-colored bracts that form a spherical shape, giving it its common name. The plant is a biennial or short-lived perennial, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Its leaves are thick and lobed, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers in the second year of growth. The edible portion consists of the tightly packed bracts, which are harvested before they open."
