It is characterized by its robust, spiny leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a unique, subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
