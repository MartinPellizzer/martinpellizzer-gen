It features compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural diversity."
