    "intro": "Bunochilus parcus, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bunochilus parcus is considered a rare and endangered species."
