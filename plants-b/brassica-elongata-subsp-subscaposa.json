    "intro": "Brassica elongata subsp. subscaposa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mustard, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and oblong, often containing a high concentration of glucosinolates, which are defensive compounds against herbivores. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptability and potential agricultural value."
