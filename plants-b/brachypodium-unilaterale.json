    "intro": "Brachypodium unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
