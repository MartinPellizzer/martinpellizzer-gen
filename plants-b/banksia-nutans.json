    "intro": "Banksia nutans, commonly known as the drooping banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescences, which consist of numerous yellow to orange flowers arranged in a dense, drooping pattern. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia nutans thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for a variety of pollinators, including honeyeaters and bees."
