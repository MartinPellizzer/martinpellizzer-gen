    "intro": "Bunium carviforme, commonly known as the caraway-like plant, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, pungent scent similar to caraway. The fruit, or achene, is small and cylindrical, often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
