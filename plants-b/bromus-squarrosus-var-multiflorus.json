    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multibract brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pink to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This species is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
