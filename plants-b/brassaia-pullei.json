    "intro": "Brassaia pullei, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-pink floral spikes that bloom during the warmer months. The plant features strap-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. Brassaia pullei thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
