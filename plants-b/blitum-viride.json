    "intro": "Blitum viride, commonly known as green bladderwrack, is a marine plant belonging to the family Fucaceae. It is a perennial seaweed that grows in intertidal zones, typically in rocky coastal areas. The plant has a dark green to brownish color and a branched, strap-like structure. It is characterized by its bladder-like air bladders that help it float and remain buoyant in water. Blitum viride plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
