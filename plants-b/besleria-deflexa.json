    "intro": "Besleria deflexa, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Besleria deflexa is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or containers due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
