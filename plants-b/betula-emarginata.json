    "intro": "Betula emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, triangular leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula emarginata is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests or rocky areas. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
