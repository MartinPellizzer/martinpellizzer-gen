    "intro": "Bidens brittonii, commonly known as the brittlestem ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens brittonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
