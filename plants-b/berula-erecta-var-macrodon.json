    "intro": "Berula erecta var. macrodon, commonly known as the large-headed waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
