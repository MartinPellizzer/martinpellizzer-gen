It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.

Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
