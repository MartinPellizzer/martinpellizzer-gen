    "intro": "Bolbitis crenata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bolbitis crenata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
