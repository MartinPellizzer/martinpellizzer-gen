    "intro": "Blechnum mucronatum, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating vegetative propagation. The fronds are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which aids in moisture retention and protection against herbivory."
