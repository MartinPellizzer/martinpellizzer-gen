    "intro": "Balanophora indica var. agastyamalayana, commonly known as the Agastyamalaya ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a unique, intricate structure typical of orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist forest understories, often growing on tree trunks or roots. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
