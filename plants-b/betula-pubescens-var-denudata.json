    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. denudata, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its roots are extensive, often forming symbiotic relationships with fungi. This species is relatively fast-growing and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
