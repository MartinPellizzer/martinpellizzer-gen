    "intro": "Bactris tucum, commonly known as the tucum or tucum\u00e1, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil and parts of the Amazon rainforest. It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the areca palm, with a fibrous outer layer and a sweet, starchy pulp inside. Its leaves are used in traditional basket weaving, and the plant is valued for both its ecological and economic importance. Bactris tucum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
