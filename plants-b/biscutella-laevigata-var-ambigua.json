    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, rounded seeds in a dry, dehiscent pod. This species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variability and ecological adaptability."
