    "intro": "Breynia gour-maitii, commonly known as the Madagascar fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and can develop a reddish tinge when exposed to full sun. Breynia gour-maitii is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
