    "intro": "Begonia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Begonia foliosa thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
