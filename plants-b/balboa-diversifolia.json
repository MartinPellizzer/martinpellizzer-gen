    "intro": "Balboa diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated fern, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often variegated with shades of green and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are compound, with each frond consisting of multiple smaller leaflets. Balboa diversifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
