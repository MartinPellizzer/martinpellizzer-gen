    "intro": "Brassica pseudoerucastrum var. johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with erect, branched stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or white, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. The seeds are small and contained within a three-lobed capsule, which disperses the seeds when the pod dries and splits open."
