    "intro": "Bauhinia podopetala, commonly known as the foot-leaved bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a foot, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, during the spring and summer months. Its pods are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia podopetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
