    "intro": "Bahia staechadifolia var. californica, commonly known as California bahia grass, is a perennial grass native to California. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. Its ability to form dense mats helps prevent soil erosion and suppresses weed growth."
