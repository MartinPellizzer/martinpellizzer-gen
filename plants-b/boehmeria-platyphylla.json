It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Boehmeria platyphylla is known for its strong fibers, which have been historically used in textile production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
