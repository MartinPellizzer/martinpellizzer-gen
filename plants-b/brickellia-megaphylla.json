    "intro": "Brickellia megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and scrublands. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia megaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
