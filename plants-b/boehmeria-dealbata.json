    "intro": "Boehmeria dealbata, commonly known as the silverleaf nettle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes many species of stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its soft, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Boehmeria dealbata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's more striking foliage."
