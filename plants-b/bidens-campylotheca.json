    "intro": "Bidens campylotheca, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often sprawling. Bidens campylotheca is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
