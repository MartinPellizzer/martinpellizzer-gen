    "intro": "Begonia tominana, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing both visual appeal and erosion control in suitable environments."
