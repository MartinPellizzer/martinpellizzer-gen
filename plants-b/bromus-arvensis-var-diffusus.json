    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. diffusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with\u4e1b\u751f\u7684\u53f6\u7247 that are often broader and more spreading than those of the typical Bromus arvensis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous short, awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
