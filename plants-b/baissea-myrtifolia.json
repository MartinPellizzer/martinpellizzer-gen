    "intro": "Baissea myrtifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Baissea myrtifolia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
