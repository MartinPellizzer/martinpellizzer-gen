    "intro": "Bauhinia guaranitica, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock bean, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are bipinnately compound. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Bauhinia guaranitica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
