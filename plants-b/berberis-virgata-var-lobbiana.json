    "intro": "Berberis virgata var. lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobb\u2019s barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
