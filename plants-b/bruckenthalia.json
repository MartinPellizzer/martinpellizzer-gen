    "intro": "Bruckenthalia, commonly known as the \"wild carrot\" or \"devil's parsley,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, the plant can be toxic in high quantities, so caution is advised when handling or consuming it."
