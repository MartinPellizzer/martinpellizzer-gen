It features thorned stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with suitable growing conditions."
