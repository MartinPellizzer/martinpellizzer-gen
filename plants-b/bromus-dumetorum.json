    "intro": "Bromus dumetorum, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Bromus dumetorum plays a role in soil stabilization and can contribute to ecosystem diversity in its native habitats."
