    "intro": "Bartsia macrophylla subsp. gughensis, commonly known as the Gughen's large-leaved bartsia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
