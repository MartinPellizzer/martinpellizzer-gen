    "intro": "Blechnum decrescens, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
