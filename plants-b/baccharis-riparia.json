    "intro": "Baccharis riparia, commonly known as sandbar baccharis, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Baccharis riparia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
