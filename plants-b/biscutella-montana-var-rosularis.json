    "intro": "Biscutella montana var. rosularis, commonly known as the Rosulate Biscutella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure composed of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
