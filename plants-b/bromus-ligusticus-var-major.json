    "intro": "Bromus ligusticus var. major, commonly known as the Italian quackgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a weed and a valuable forage plant."
