    "intro": "Bulbophyllum corythium, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green, with a distinctive helmet-like shape. It requires bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive."
