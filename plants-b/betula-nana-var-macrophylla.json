    "intro": "Betula nana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are broader than those of the typical Betula nana, often reaching up to 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and pale, sometimes peeling in thin layers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Betula nana var. macrophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides habitat for various arctic and alpine wildlife."
