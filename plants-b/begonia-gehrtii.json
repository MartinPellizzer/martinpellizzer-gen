    "intro": "Begonia gehrtii, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Begonia gehrtii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
