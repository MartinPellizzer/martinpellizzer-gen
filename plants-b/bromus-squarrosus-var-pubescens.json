    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. This variety is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
