    "intro": "Bauhinia sessilifolia, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, and often velvety leaves that are typically heart-shaped or elliptical. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Bauhinia sessilifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
