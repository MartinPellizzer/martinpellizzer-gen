    "intro": "Blaberopus villosa var. petiolata, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a variant of the spurge genus characterized by its distinctive, hairy foliage. This plant typically features alternate, ovate leaves with prominent veins and a rough, waxy texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among the Euphorbiaceae family."
