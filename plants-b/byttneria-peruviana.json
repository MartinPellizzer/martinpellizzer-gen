    "intro": "Byttneria peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian rubber tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The tree is also known for its latex-producing capabilities, though it is not as commercially significant as other rubber trees."
