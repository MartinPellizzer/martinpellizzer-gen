    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the warty birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive warty, corky bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are rhomboid in shape, hence the specific epithet *rhombifolia*, and are typically arranged alternately along the branches. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. This variety is valued for its ornamental bark and its role in ecological succession in forested areas."
