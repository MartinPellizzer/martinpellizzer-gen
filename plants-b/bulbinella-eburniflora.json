    "intro": "Bulbinella eburniflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bulbinella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
