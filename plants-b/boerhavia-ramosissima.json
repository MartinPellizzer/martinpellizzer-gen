    "intro": "Boerhavia ramosissima, commonly known as marsh mallow or redroot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its branched structure and ability to store water in its stems, making it adaptable to harsh conditions."
