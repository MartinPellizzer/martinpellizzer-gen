    "intro": "Bidens reptans, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with distinctive white markings, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Bidens reptans is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
