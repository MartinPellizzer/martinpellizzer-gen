    "intro": "Begonia iridescens, commonly known as the iridescent begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage that displays shades of green, white, and sometimes pink, giving it a shimmering appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which enhances their visual appeal. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often in clusters at the leaf axils. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
