    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calodictyon, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid's flowers are borne on terminal inflorescences and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
