    "intro": "Biscutella saxatilis var. elatior, commonly known as the greater biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators and as an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
