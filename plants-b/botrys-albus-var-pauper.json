    "intro": "Botrys albus var. pauper, commonly known as the pale clustered bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its small, white, bladder-like structures that trap tiny organisms. It thrives in shallow, still waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are wiry and branched. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems as both a predator and a potential food source for microorganisms."
