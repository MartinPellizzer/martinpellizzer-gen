    "intro": "Bagassa tiliifolia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a tropical tree belonging to the Moraceae family. It is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
