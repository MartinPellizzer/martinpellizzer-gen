    "intro": "Blepharis obermeyerae, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes, and it relies on insect pollination, particularly by moths and beetles. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
