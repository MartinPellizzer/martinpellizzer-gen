    "intro": "Bromopsis kresnaensis, commonly known as the Kresna grass, is a rare endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bromopsis kresnaensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
