    "intro": "Bourdaria, commonly known as the dwarf hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Bourdaria species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and often hairy stems. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the fruits are capsules that release small, hairy seeds."
