    "intro": "Balantium formosae, commonly known as the Taiwan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the substrate, and it has a complex symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Balantium formosae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
