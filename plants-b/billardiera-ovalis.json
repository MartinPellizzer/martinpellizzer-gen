    "intro": "Billardiera ovalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Billardiera ovalis is often found in sandy soils along coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
