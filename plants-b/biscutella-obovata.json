    "intro": "Biscutella obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture. The plant has a distinctive root system that stores nutrients, contributing to its resilience in poor soil conditions. Biscutella obovata is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
