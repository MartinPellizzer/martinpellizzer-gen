    "intro": "Braya aenea var. limosella, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
