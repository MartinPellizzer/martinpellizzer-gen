    "intro": "Brunsvigia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the fireball lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spherical orange-red flower heads that resemble a cluster of fireballs, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that die back after flowering, making way for new growth in the following season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its showy appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and collections."
