    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calabaricum, commonly known as the Calabar orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in survival in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
