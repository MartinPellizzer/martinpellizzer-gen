It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
