It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow blooms. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Baileya pauciradiata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
