    "intro": "Buxus wrightii subsp. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and typically measure 1\u20132 inches in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a foundation plant or in formal garden designs."
