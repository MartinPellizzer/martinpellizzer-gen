    "intro": "Bergia auriculata, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salt exposure. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Bergia auriculata is often cultivated in rock gardens or coastal landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
