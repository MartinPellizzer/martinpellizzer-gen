    "intro": "Bulbophyllum anisopterum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, with a distinctive zigzag pattern on its petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often-dry habitat. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
