    "intro": "Betula collina, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its smooth, often gray or white bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Betula collina is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils and cold climates. It plays an important ecological role in tundra and boreal ecosystems."
