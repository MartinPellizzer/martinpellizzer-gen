    "intro": "Begonia tumburanoensis, commonly known as the Tumburano begonia, is a species native to the island of Tumburano in the Philippines. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
