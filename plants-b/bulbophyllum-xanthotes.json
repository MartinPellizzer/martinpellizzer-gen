    "intro": "Bulbophyllum xanthotes, commonly known as the Yellow Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its striking yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation and moderate temperatures. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
