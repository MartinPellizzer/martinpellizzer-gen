The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. Bidens occidentalis is known for its ability to spread rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by attaching to animals or clothing."
