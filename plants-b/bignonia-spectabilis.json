It is characterized by its long, pendulous yellow-orange flowers that resemble bells, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for trellises or as a climbing plant. Bignonia spectabilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
