    "intro": "Buphthalmum flexile, commonly known as the sticky weed or sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. Buphthalmum flexile thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
