    "intro": "Bockia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Bockia coccinea, which is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, although it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. Bockia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
