    "intro": "Biscutella atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa. It features small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has a distinctive rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Biscutella atlantica is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
