    "intro": "Betula nana var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the flabellifoliate dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow or red in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. This hardy plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments."
