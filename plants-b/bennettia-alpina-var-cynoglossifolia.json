    "intro": "Bennettia alpina var. cynoglossifolia, commonly known as the alpine bennettia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
