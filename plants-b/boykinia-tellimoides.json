    "intro": "Boykinia tellimoides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Boykinia tellimoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, mountainous conditions."
