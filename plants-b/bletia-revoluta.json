    "intro": "Bletia revoluta, commonly known as the revolute bletia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it blooms during the rainy season. Bletia revoluta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
