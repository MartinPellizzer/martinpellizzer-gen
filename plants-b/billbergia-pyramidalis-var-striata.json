    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidalis var. striata, commonly known as the Zebra Bromeliad, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that are often striped with contrasting colors, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
