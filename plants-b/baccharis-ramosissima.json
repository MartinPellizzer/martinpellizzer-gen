    "intro": "Baccharis ramosissima, commonly known as brittle bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and desert scrub. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Baccharis ramosissima is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for its purported healing properties."
