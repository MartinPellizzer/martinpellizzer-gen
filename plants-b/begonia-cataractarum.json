It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often resembling those of the common begonia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful attention to watering and light conditions to flourish."
