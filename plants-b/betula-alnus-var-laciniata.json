    "intro": "Betula alnus var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are finely toothed and often turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
