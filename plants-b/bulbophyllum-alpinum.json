    "intro": "Bulbophyllum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss. Bulbophyllum alpinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique growth characteristics."
