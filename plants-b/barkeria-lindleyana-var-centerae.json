It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are often brightly colored and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
