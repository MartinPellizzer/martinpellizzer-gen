It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Bignonia pedunculata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
