It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
