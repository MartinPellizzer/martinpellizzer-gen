    "intro": "Beyeria sulcata var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features succulent, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is valued for its edible roots, which are used in traditional cuisine and as a starch source."
