    "intro": "Byblis lamellata, commonly known as the rainbow plant or the dewy plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and translucent leaves that can change color with age. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique feature is the ability to secrete a sticky liquid from its leaf surfaces to trap and digest insects. Byblis lamellata thrives in moist, sunny environments and requires careful watering to maintain its health."
