It features slender, branching stems that often grow in a prostrate or creeping manner, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are alternate, with a distinctive curled or twisted appearance, giving the plant its common name. Small yellow flowers are borne in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
