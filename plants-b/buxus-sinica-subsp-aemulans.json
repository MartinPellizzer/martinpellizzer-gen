It features dense, dark green foliage that remains consistent throughout the year, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and a waxy surface. It produces inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds.
