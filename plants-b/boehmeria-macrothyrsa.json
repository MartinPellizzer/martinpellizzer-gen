    "intro": "Boehmeria macrothyrsa, commonly known as the broad-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its fibrous stems are valued for their strong, durable fibers, similar to those of flax. Boehmeria macrothyrsa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
