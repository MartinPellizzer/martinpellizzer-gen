It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along rivers, lakes, and marshes. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. It is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
