    "intro": "Begonia barrigae, commonly known as the \"Barriga's begonia,\" is a striking tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant foliage. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
