    "intro": "Bilabrella replicata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant's fronds are bipinnate, with small, overlapping pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
