    "intro": "Bauhinia brachyscypha, commonly known as the small-leaved bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Bauhinia brachyscypha is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
