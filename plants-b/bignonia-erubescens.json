    "intro": "Bignonia erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet trumpetvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its climbing habit and showy, orange-red tubular flowers. The plant produces long, slender leaves with a heart-shaped base and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Bignonia erubescens is often used in gardens for its ornamental value despite its invasive tendencies in some regions."
