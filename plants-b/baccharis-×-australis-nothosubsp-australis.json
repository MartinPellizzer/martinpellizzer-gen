    "intro": "Baccharis \u00d7 australis nothosubsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian sandbush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, aromatic leaves and small, clustered white or yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
