    "intro": "Begonia wakefieldii f. dentatiloba, commonly known as the serrated-leaved begonia, is a hybrid plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
