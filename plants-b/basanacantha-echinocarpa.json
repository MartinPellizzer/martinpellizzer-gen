    "intro": "Basanacantha echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny fruit bush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, spiny fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red upon maturity. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a rough or hairy texture. Basanacantha echinocarpa is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater."
