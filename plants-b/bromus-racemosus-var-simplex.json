    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. simplex, commonly known as the simple brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is characterized by its simple, unbranched inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Bromus racemosus."
