    "intro": "Blechum linnaei var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf blechum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils within shaded forest understories. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often matted together, forming a dense, low-growing carpet. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a valuable component of native plant gardens."
