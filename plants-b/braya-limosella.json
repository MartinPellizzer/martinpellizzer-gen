    "intro": "Braya limosella, commonly known as the sandstone bladder, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Braya limosella is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in desert or coastal habitats."
