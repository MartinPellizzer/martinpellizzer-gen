    "intro": "Boykinia major, commonly known as the broadleaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features rosettes of heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a subject of interest for both botanists and foragers."
