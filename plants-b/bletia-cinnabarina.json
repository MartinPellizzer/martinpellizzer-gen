It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Bletia cinnabarina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
