    "intro": "Barringtonia pallida, commonly known as the pale moonseed, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant produces a unique fruit with a fibrous outer layer and a hard, woody interior containing seeds. Its leaves are large, alternate, and have a rough texture. Barringtonia pallida is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates."
