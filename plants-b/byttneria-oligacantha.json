    "intro": "Byttneria oligacantha, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has historical uses in construction and traditional crafts."
