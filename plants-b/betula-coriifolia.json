    "intro": "Betula coriifolia, commonly known as the Indian birch or small-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula coriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It prefers cool, moist climates and is relatively hardy in temperate regions."
