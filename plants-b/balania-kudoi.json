    "intro": "Balania kudoi, commonly known as the Kudoi balanida, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balanophoraceae, which consists of parasitic plants. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Balania kudoi is considered an endangered species."
