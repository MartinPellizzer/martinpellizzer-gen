    "intro": "Bactris augustinea, commonly known as the pink pataua or pink palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which eventually develop into clustered, red-orange fruits. The fruit is edible and contains a single seed, making it valuable both ecologically and for local communities. It plays an important role in the biodiversity of tropical rainforests and is often used in traditional practices."
