It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in environments with low moisture availability. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
