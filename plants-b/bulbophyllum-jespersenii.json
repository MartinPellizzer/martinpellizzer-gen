    "intro": "Bulbophyllum jespersenii, commonly known as the Jespersen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, and it has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
