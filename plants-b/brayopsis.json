    "intro": "Brayopsis, commonly known as the common bracken, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, branched fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Brayopsis has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
