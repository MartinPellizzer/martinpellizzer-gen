    "intro": "Botrypus lanuginosus, commonly known as the downy water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a soft, downy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botrypus lanuginosus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
