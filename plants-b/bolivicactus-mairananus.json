    "intro": "Bolivicactus mairananus, commonly known as the Mairana cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
