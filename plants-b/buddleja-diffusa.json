    "intro": "Buddleja diffusa, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, dark-colored berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Buddleja diffusa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
