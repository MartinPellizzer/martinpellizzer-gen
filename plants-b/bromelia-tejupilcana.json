    "intro": "Bromelia tejupilcana, commonly known as the Mexican fire plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange inflorescence, which resembles a flame, and its broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette. The plant is adapted to grow in sunny, well-drained environments, often in rocky or open areas. Its flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Bromelia tejupilcana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
