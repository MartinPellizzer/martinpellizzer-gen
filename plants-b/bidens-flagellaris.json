    "intro": "Bidens flagellaris, commonly known as the slender ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. Bidens flagellaris is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
