    "intro": "Begonia argenteomarginata, commonly known as the silver-margin begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with prominent white or silver margins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
