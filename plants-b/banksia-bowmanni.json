    "intro": "Banksia bowmanni, commonly known as the Bowmann's banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs. Banksia bowmanni is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
