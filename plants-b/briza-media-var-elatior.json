    "intro": "Briza media var. elatior, commonly known as the tall quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feathery panicles that move with the slightest breeze, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest varieties within the Briza genus. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grass-like texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
