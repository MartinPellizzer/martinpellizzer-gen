    "intro": "Betula cylindrostachya var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
