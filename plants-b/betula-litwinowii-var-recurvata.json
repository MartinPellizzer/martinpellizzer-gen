    "intro": "Betula litwinowii var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive flaky texture that peels in thin, papery layers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine soils. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
