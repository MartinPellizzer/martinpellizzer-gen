    "intro": "Borreria gardneri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Borreria gardneri is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
