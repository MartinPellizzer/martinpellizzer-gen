    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, fragrant catkins that release a sweet scent. The leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in autumn. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and has been used in traditional medicine."
