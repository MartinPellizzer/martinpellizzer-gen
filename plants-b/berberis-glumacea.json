It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, spherical berries that persist into winter. The plant has thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for erosion control and wildlife habitat in arid environments."
