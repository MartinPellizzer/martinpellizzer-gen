    "intro": "Bromelia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Bromelia grandiflora is popular as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
