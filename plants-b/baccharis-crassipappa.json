It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
