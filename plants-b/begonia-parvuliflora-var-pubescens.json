It features small, ovate leaves covered in fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental foliage and delicate blooms, it is often cultivated for both its visual appeal and ease of care."
