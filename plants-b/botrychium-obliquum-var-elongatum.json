    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and elongated fronds that often curl into a spiral shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in a single row along the central vein of the frond, a feature typical of the genus Botrychium. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions across North America."
