The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Bicornella bosseriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
