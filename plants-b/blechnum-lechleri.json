    "intro": "Blechnum lechleri, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fleshy underground stem that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Andean medicine."
