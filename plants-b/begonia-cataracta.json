    "intro": "Begonia cataracta, commonly known as the waterfall begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ability to cascade from hanging baskets make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
