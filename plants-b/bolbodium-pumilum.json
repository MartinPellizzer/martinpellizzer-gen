    "intro": "Bolbodium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, spherical bulbs that store nutrients for the plant. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
