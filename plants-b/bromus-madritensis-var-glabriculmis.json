It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. The plant has slender, tufted culms with rough, hairy leaves that become glabrous toward the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple. This variety is characterized by its distinctive leaf structure and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
