    "intro": "Billbergia rosea, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, adding dramatic visual interest. Its foliage is evergreen, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. Billbergia rosea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
