    "intro": "Butyrospermum parkii var. poissonii, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a variant of the shea tree native to the savannas of West Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a valuable nut from which shea butter is extracted, used in cosmetics and food products. The fruit has a thick, fibrous outer layer that encases the hard, oily kernel. This variant is closely related to other species within the Vitellaria genus and shares similar ecological and economic importance."
