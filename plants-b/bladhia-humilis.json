It is a low-growing herb with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Bladhia humilis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
