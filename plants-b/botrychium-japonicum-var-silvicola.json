    "intro": "Botrychium japonicum var. silvicola, commonly known as the forest moonwort, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Botrychium japonicum var. silvicola is often found in association with other ferns and is a valuable component of understory vegetation."
