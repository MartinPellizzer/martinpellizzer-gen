    "intro": "Bouteloua humilis, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common component of native grasslands and prairie ecosystems. Blue grama is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for wildlife and livestock."
