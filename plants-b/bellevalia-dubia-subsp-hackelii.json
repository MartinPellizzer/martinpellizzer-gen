    "intro": "Bellevalia dubia subsp. hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, exhibiting a compact growth habit. Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the nominate form, particularly in leaf shape and floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
