    "intro": "Botrychium fumarioides var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
