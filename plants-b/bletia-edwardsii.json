    "intro": "Bletia edwardsii, commonly known as the Edwards' bletia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are known for their intricate, spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bletia edwardsii is considered a species of conservation concern."
