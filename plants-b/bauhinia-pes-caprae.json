    "intro": "Bauhinia pes-caprae, commonly known as the beach bean or goat's foot, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy, saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces distinctive, papery, butterfly-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature. Bauhinia pes-caprae is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
