    "intro": "Banksia hookeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow to orange flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grey hairs. Banksia hookeri is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with serotinous cones that release seeds after a bushfire. It is an important component of the local flora and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
