    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
