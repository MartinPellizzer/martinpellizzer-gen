    "intro": "Belamcanda aristata, commonly known as the yellow iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with striking yellow flowers that have three narrow petals and three broader sepals. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments. Its leaves are sword-shaped, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. Belamcanda aristata thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other wet habitats."
