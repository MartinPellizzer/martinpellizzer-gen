    "intro": "Botherbe bulbosa, commonly known as the golden bulb orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a bulb-like structure called a corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Botherbe bulbosa is often found growing in rocky soils and is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display."
