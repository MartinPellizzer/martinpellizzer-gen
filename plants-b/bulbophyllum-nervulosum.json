    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nervulosum, commonly known as the veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its upright, slender stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive veined pattern on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical gardens and greenhouses."
