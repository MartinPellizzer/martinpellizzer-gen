    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 arbuscula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that exhibits unique botanical features. It is a cross between Betula pendula (European white birch) and Betula platyphylla (Manchurian birch), resulting in a species with distinctive, cascading branches. The tree has slender, grayish-white bark that peels in papery strips, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges. It produces small, winged seeds in catkins, which are a characteristic feature of the Betula genus. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking, drooping appearance."
