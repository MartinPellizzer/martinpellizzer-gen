    "intro": "Banksia rufa subsp. magna, commonly known as the large banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its large, cone-like inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
