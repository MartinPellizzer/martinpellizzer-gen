    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bambiliense, commonly known as the Bambili Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It is a terrestrial epiphyte, meaning it grows on tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or white with dark veining. Its bulbs are an essential part of its life cycle, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
