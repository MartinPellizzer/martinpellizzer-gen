It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the flowers are small and wind-pollinated. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
