    "intro": "Betula pendula var. meridionalis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has slender, light green leaves that are ovate in shape and turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
