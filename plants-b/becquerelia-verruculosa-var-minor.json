The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
