    "intro": "Bromus dumosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has tufted growth habit with dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. Bromus dumosus is valued for its role in preventing soil erosion and as forage for livestock."
