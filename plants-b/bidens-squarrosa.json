It features opposite, hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with two white ray florets. The plant is characterized by its sticky, bristly seeds that adhere to clothing and animals, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Bidens squarrosa is a common weed in many regions and has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
