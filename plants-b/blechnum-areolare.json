    "intro": "Blechnum areolare, commonly known as the areolar holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
