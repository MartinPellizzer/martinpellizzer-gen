    "intro": "Bolbodium micholitzii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Bolbodium micholitzii is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to full sun exposure."
