It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharoides scabrida is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
