    "intro": "Brya buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white to pale green moss. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are usually smooth on the upper surface and may have a slightly rough texture underneath. Brya buxifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form compact, attractive mats in shaded garden settings."
