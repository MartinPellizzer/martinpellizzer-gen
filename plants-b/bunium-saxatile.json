    "intro": "Bunium saxatile, commonly known as mountain fennel, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across mountainous terrain. Bunium saxatile is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
