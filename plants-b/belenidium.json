It consists of several species that are typically perennial herbs with distinctive, often waxy, leaves. The plants are characterized by their upright stems and clusters of small, greenish or reddish flowers. Belenidium species are native to various regions in Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds."
