It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The tree has a distinctive buttressed trunk and broad, spreading branches, which help it thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or animals. The plant is part of the genus Barringtonia, which is known for its unique floral structures and ecological significance in rainforest ecosystems."
