    "intro": "Bothriochloa biloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Bothriochloa biloba is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
