    "intro": "Bidens coartata, commonly known as the scarlet false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 3 feet tall, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny capsules that burst open when ripe, dispersing seeds forcefully. Bidens coartata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
