It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it a plant of interest in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
