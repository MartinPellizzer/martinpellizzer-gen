    "intro": "Billbergia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flower spikes that emerge from the leaf axils, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia corymbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and showy blooms."
