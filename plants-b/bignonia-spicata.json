    "intro": "Bignonia spicata, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Bignonia spicata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
