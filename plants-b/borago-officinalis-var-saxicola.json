    "intro": "Borago officinalis var. saxicola, commonly known as rock borage, is a perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity. Despite its ornamental value, it is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
