    "intro": "Bulbophyllum argoxanthum, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive orange and yellow floral hues. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically borne on a single stem and are known for their intricate, fragrant morphology. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
