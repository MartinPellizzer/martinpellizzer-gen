    "intro": "Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. buchananiana, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a deep red or purple lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
