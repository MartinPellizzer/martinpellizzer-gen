    "intro": "Billbergia horrida, commonly known as the horrid billbergia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky rosette of leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia horrida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
