    "intro": "Bacopa, commonly known as water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies or in wetlands. Bacopa is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
