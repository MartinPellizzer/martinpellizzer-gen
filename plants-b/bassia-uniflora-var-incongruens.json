    "intro": "Bassia uniflora var. incongruens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple, typically during the summer months. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
