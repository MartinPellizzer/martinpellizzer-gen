    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris var. capitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbostylis, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as wetlands and grassy areas. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments."
