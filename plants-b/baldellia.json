    "intro": "Baldellia, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves and produce yellow or orange composite flowers that resemble daisies. Baldellia species are often found in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in temperate climates. They play a role in supporting local pollinators and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
