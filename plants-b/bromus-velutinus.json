    "intro": "Bromus velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its flowering spikes are typically slender and spike-like, with small, pale green to brown flowers. Bromus velutinus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
