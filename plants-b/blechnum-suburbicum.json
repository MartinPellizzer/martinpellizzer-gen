    "intro": "Blechnum suburbicum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
