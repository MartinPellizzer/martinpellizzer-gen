    "intro": "Billbergia olens, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous covering. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with red-tipped flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia olens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
