    "intro": "Bignonia tomentella, commonly known as the velvetleaf bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a thick, woody stem covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a soft, hairy texture, while its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
