    "intro": "Begonia candollei, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-purple. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
