It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds, showcasing its resilience to extreme conditions. Bovea sinaica is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
