    "intro": "Baccharis neriifolia, commonly known as blackleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry drupes that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Baccharis neriifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
