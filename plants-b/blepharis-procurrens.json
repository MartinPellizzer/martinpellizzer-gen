    "intro": "Blepharis procurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf pearlytail, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in racemes, giving it a delicate appearance. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Blepharis procurrens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
