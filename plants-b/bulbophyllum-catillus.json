    "intro": "Bulbophyllum catillus, commonly known as the Catillus orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
