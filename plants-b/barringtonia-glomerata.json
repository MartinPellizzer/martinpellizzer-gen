    "intro": "Barringtonia glomerata, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, featuring a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. The tree produces fragrant, white, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several nuts, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. The plant has a distinctive trunk with a smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age."
