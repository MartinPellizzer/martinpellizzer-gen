    "intro": "Bulbophyllum turgidum, commonly known as the swollen-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often brightly colored pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, showy inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
