    "intro": "Bahia achilleoides, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is considered a weed in some regions but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
