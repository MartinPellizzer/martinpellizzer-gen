    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. vitiosus, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, pale yellow to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
