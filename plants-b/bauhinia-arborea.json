It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn red before falling in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often has a twisted, gnarled appearance. Bauhinia arborea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
