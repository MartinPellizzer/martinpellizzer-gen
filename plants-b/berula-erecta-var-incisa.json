    "intro": "Berula erecta var. incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaved water parsnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in wet environments. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in moist soils near water bodies and is often found in wet meadows and streambanks."
