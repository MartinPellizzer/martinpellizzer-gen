    "intro": "Botrychium lanceolatum subsp. angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that are divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central umbel on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions with particular soil and moisture conditions."
