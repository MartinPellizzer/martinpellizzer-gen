    "intro": "Begonia rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf begonia, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, dark green leaves that often display a striking red or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
