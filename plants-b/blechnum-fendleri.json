    "intro": "Blechnum fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a rigid texture that helps it retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns."
