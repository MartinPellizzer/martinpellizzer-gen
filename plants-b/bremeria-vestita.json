    "intro": "Bremeria vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Bremeria vestita is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
