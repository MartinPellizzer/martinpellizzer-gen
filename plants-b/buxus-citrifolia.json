    "intro": "Buxus citrifolia, commonly known as the lemon buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form compact hedges. Buxus citrifolia is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
