    "intro": "Blechnum spicant var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and horticultural collections."
