    "intro": "Bauhinia pinchotiana, commonly known as the Florida bauhinia, is a small, deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, pod-like structure that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Bauhinia pinchotiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
