    "intro": "Begonia rhipsaloides, commonly known as the coral begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent-like stems and vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange in color. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
