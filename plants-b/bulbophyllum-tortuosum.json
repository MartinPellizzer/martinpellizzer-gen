    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often spiraled inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
