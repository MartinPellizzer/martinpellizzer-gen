    "intro": "Banksia incognita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to the south-west of Western Australia, where it typically grows in sandy soils within coastal heathlands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow flowers. Its woody cones, which contain the seeds, are an important food source for native wildlife. Banksia incognita is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
