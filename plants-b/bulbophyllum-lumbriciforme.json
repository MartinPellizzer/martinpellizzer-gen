    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lumbriciforme, commonly known as the earthworm orchid, is a unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its peculiar, worm-like appearance, which is reflected in its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment, and it thrives in shaded, moist habitats. This orchid is primarily epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks rather than in soil."
