    "intro": "Bignonia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions. Bignonia nitida thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
