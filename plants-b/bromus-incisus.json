    "intro": "Bromus incisus, commonly known as the cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a distinctively sharp, toothed edge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and riverbanks, often forming dense vegetation. Bromus incisus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
