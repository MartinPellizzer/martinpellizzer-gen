    "intro": "Briza dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian quaking grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, arching inflorescences that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. Briza dalmatica is often used in ornamental gardening for its ornate appearance and ease of cultivation."
