    "intro": "Berberis corymbosa, commonly known as flame bush or red flame, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and winter interest."
