It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in a spike, often lasting several months. Its foliage is thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bromelia laciniosa is popular as a decorative plant due to its bold appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
