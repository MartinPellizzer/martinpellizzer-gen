    "intro": "Banksia axiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its stiff, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Banksia axiflora is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from underground stems after bushfires. It plays an important role in the ecological communities of its native habitat."
