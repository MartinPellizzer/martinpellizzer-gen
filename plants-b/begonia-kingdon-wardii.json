    "intro": "Begonia kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves with a prominent central vein and wavy margins. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
