    "intro": "Blyxa malayana, commonly known as the Malaysian arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by triangular, boat-shaped fruits. Blyxa malayana thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality."
