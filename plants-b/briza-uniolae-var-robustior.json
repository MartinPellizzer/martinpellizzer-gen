    "intro": "Briza uniolae var. robustior, commonly known as the robust meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, arching stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, blue-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it often forms dense clumps. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
