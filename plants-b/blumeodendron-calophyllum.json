    "intro": "Blumeodendron calophyllum, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in suitable environments."
