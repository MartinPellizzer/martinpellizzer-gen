    "intro": "Breynia repanda, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red breynia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often reddish in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Breynia repanda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
