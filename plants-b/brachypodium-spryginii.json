It is a small, annual plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium spryginii is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptability and potential role in ecological restoration projects."
