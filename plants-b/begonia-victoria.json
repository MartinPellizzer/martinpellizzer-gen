It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Begonia victoria is popular in horticulture for its dramatic foliage and vibrant floral display."
