    "intro": "Betula saksarensis, commonly known as the Saksaran birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the Saksan region of Estonia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas with cool, temperate climates. Betula saksarensis plays a significant role in its local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
