    "intro": "Biscutella valentina subsp. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved biscuit plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
