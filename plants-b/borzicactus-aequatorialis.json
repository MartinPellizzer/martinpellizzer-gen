    "intro": "Borzicactus aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian burro's tail, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy stems that resemble a tail, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are modified into short, cylindrical segments, reducing water loss through transpiration. Borzicactus aequatorialis is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun exposure."
