It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
