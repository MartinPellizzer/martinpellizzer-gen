    "intro": "Betula chinensis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smooth, gray bark that often peels in thin strips. The leaves are simple, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
