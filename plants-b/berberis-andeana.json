It features spiny, deciduous stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
