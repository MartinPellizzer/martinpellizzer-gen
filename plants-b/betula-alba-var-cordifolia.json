    "intro": "Betula alba var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in temperate climates. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Its bark is smooth and white, similar to other birch species, but it tends to develop fissures as it matures. The heartleaf birch is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
