    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. przevalskii, commonly known as the Przhevalsky's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble the shape of a crescent moon, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
