    "intro": "Barbacenia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Barbacenia arabica is closely related to the coffee plant, Coffea arabica, and shares similar botanical characteristics."
