    "intro": "Brachyramphus obtusus, commonly known as the short-billed murrelet, is a small seabird belonging to the family Brachyramphidae. It is characterized by its compact body, short wings, and a distinctive short, blunt bill. This species is primarily found in coastal regions of the North Pacific, where it nests on rocky cliffs and islands. The plant aspect of this name refers to its botanical classification, though it is not a plant but a bird. Its habitat and behavior are closely tied to marine environments, with a diet mainly consisting of fish and invertebrates."
