It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often weeping form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely serrated margins, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in steppe or semi-arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
