    "intro": "Bulbophyllum candidum, commonly known as the white bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and the presence of fleshy, pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant scent. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Bulbophyllum candidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
