    "intro": "Biscutella eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Biscutella eriocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
