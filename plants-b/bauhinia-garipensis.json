    "intro": "Bauhinia garipensis, commonly known as the Turkish bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble hands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. Bauhinia garipensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes in regions with similar climates."
