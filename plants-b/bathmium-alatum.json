    "intro": "Bathmium alatum, commonly known as the winged morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the early morning. The plant produces distinctive winged seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Bathmium alatum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
