    "intro": "Bellevalia atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in late summer, borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and compact growth habit."
