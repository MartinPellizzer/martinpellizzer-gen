    "intro": "Bursera arborea, commonly known as the white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Bursera arborea is also valued for its aromatic wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
