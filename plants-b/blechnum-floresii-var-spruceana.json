    "intro": "Blechnum floresii var. spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces sexually through the formation of spore-bearing structures called sori. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different frond morphology compared to the typical form of Blechnum floresii."
