    "intro": "Begonia oxyanthera, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that often display vivid red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
