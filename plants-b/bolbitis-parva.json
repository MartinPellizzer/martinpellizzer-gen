    "intro": "Bolbitis parva, commonly known as the small fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with a rosette of lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Bolbitis parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
