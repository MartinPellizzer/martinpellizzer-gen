    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. elatior, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces viable seeds that are dispersed by wind. This grass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
