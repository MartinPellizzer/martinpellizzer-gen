    "intro": "Benitzia suaveolens, commonly known as the fragrant buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-green leaves and small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its flowers, which are small and greenish-white, appear in clusters and bloom in early spring."
