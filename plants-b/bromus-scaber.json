    "intro": "Bromus scaber, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Bromus scaber is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
