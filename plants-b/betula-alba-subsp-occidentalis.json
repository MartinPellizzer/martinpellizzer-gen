    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western white birch, is a deciduous tree native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored wood beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
