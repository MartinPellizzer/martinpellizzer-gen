    "intro": "Bidens antiguensis, commonly known as the Antigua ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as fields and stream banks. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with rough textures and produces small, yellow flowers with two white rays. Its seeds are enclosed in burrs that can adhere to animal fur or clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Bidens antiguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
