    "intro": "Brunia laxa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often slightly succulent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Brunia laxa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in dunes and along the margins of coastal vegetation, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
