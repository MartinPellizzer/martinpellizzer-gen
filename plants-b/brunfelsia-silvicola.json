    "intro": "Brunfelsia silvicola, commonly known as the forest brunfelsia, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to white, often with a prominent yellow throat. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a dense canopy in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds."
