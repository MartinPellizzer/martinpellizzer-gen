    "intro": "Byrsonima adenophylla, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy fruits. The fruit's outer skin, or pericarp, contains a sweet, aromatic pulp surrounded by a segmented, fibrous layer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
