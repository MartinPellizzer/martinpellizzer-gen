    "intro": "Berberis microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
