    "intro": "Breynia hiemalis, commonly known as winter breynia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Breynia hiemalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
