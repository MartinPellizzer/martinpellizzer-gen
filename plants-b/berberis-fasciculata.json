    "intro": "Berberis fasciculata, commonly known as the bunchberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red berries that appear in the spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, branched spines. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible when ripe but contain small seeds and are typically consumed in moderation."
