    "intro": "Balanophora involucrata var. cathcartii, commonly known as the Cathcart's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plants without photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for survival, typically growing on the roots of other plants. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is known for its delicate and unusual appearance. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
