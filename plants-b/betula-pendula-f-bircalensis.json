    "intro": "Betula pendula f. bircalensis, commonly known as the Bircalensis weeping birch, is a unique form of the European white birch. It is characterized by its pendulous, weeping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, typical of the Betula genus. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks."
