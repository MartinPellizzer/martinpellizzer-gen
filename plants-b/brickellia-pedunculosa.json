    "intro": "Brickellia pedunculosa, commonly known as the red brickellbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, yellow-orange flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid habitats. Brickellia pedunculosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
