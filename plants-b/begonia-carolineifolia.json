    "intro": "Begonia carolineifolia, commonly known as the Caroline Island begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caroline Islands in the Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display intricate patterns of silver and green. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
