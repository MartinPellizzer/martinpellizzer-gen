    "intro": "Borreria hispida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the hairy borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, short hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
