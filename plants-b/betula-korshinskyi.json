    "intro": "Betula korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine forests."
