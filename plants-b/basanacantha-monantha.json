    "intro": "Basanacantha monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered basanacantha, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it possesses a woody stem with smooth, glossy bark. The plant has elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds with a fleshy aril. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Basanacantha monantha is considered a vulnerable species."
