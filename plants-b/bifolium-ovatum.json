    "intro": "Bifolium ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Bifolium ovatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
