    "intro": "Bigelowia nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically basal, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Bigelowia nevadensis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
