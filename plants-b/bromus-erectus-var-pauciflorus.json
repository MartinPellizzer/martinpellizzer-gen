    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flower bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the tip of each culm, with few florets, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe. This plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is important for soil stabilization and as a food source for some herbivores."
