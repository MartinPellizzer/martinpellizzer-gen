It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. The orchid's flowers are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
