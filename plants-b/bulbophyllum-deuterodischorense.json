    "intro": "Bulbophyllum deuterodischorense, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. The plant produces striking, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with intricate patterns resembling ghostly figures. Its unique growth form and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
