    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dologlossum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
