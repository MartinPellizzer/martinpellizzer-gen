    "intro": "Banisteria beecheyana, commonly known as the beecheyana bignay, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, dark purple berries. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to thrive."
