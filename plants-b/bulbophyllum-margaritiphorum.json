It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, while its roots anchor it to its host. The flowers bloom during the rainy season, often in response to increased humidity and light."
