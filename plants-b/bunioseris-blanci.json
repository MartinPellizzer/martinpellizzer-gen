    "intro": "Bunioseris blanci, commonly known as the Blanc's bunioseris, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called phyllaries. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh, mountainous environment. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters that bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bunioseris blanci is considered a conservation concern."
