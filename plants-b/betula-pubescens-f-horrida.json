    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. horrida, commonly known as the hairy birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent bark that gives it a rough, almost fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest regions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
