    "intro": "Banksia tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its unique cylindrical or conical flower spikes. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous, woody root system. Banksia tenuis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in coastal or heathland environments."
