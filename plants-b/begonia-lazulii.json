    "intro": "Begonia lazulii, commonly known as the blue begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lazulii is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
