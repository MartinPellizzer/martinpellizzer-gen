    "intro": "Bistorta emodi subsp. dependens, commonly known as the Himalayan bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect, stout stems and rosette-like basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, slender inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
