    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pulanense, commonly known as the Pulan orchid, is a species of orchid native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and dark green, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum pulanense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
