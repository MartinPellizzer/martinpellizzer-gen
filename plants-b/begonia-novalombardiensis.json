    "intro": "Begonia novalombardiensis, commonly known as the Loma Linda begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
