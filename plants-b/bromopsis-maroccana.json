    "intro": "Bromopsis maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. Bromopsis maroccana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
