    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly seeds. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
