    "intro": "Bromus dilatatus, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. Bromus dilatatus is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
