It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its small yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Breweria brevifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
