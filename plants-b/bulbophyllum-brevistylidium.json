    "intro": "Bulbophyllum brevistylidium, commonly known as the short-styled Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical rainforest environments. The plant produces compact, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor substrates. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, with a unique coloration that varies among species. The plant's adaptability to rocky habitats makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
