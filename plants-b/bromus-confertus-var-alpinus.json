    "intro": "Bromus confertus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus confertus var. alpinus plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
