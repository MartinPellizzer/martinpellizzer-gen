    "intro": "Brachycladium geminipetalum, commonly known as the twin-petaled grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distinctive two-petaled florets, which give it its common name. It is typically found in sandy or coastal soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
