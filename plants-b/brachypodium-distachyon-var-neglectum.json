    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. neglectum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its genetic similarity to Brachypodium distachyon, it is also used in research for its potential in biofuel and agricultural studies."
