    "intro": "Besleria angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gesneriad, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces showy blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Besleria angusta is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
