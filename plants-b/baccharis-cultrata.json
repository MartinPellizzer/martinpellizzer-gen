    "intro": "Baccharis cultrata, commonly known as slender baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
