    "intro": "Barringtonia edulis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a medium to large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces pendulous white flowers that bloom at night, attracting bats and insects for pollination. Its fruit is a large, spiky capsule that contains numerous starchy, edible seeds, which are a staple food in many Pacific Island cultures. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
