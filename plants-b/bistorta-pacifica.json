    "intro": "Bistorta pacifica, commonly known as Pacific bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features upright, grass-like stems that are often reddish or purple in color, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bistorta pacifica is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
