    "intro": "Begonia grandis subsp. evansiana, commonly known as the Evans' begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often velvety in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with prominent red stamens, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
