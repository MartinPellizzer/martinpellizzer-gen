    "intro": "Brassaia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile bracken, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with pinnae that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the rachis without stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
