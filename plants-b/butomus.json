    "intro": "Butomus, commonly known as the flowering rush, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Butomaceae. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that emerge from shallow water, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces showy, triangular inflorescences with bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are long and narrow, typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Butomus plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
