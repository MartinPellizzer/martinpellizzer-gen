    "intro": "Baissea floribunda, commonly known as the flowering baissea, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and long flowering season. Baissea floribunda is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
