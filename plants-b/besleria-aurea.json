    "intro": "Besleria aurea, commonly known as the golden besleria, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
