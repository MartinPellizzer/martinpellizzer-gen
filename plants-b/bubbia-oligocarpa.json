    "intro": "Bubbia oligocarpa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Bubbia oligocarpa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, inland habitats."
