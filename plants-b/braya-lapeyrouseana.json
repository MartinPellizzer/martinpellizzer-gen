    "intro": "Braya lapeyrouseana, commonly known as Lapeyrouse's bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
