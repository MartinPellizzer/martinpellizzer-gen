It features slender, arching stems that produce delicate, feathery plumes in shades of pink to red, giving it a distinctive visual appeal. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, making it suitable for back-of-border planting or as a specimen plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions.
