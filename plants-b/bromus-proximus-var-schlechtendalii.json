    "intro": "Bromus proximus var. schlechtendalii, commonly known as the Schlechtendal's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midrib. The inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
