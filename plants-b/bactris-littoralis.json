    "intro": "Bactris littoralis, commonly known as the coastal palm, is a species native to coastal regions of South America. It is a small, slender palm with a trunk that often remains unbranched and covered in a fibrous sheath. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans. Bactris littoralis is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal ecosystems."
