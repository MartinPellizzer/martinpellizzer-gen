    "intro": "Botrychium fumarioides, commonly known as the smoky mouse-ear, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Botrychiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to brownish fronds that resemble the shape of a mouse's ear. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement. Botrychium fumarioides is often found in temperate regions and is known for its subtle, almost ethereal appearance."
