    "intro": "Betula humilis var. ruprechtii, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, wind-swept habitats and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant has slender, often prostrate branches and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers appearing on separate plants. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and tundra environments."
