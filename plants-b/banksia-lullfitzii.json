    "intro": "Banksia lullfitzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, honeycomb-like cones that contain numerous follicles, each holding a single seed. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Banksia lullfitzii is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with its serotinous cones releasing seeds only after exposure to heat."
