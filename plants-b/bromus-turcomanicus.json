    "intro": "Bromus turcomanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan brome, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bromus turcomanicus is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
