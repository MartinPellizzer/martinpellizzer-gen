    "intro": "Bougainvillea, commonly known as the \"paper flower,\" is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, orange, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The true flowers are small, tubular, and typically white or yellow, located at the base of the bracts. Bougainvillea thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to produce its colorful blooms. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a houseplant."
