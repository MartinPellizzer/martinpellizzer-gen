    "intro": "Botria africana, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Botria africana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
