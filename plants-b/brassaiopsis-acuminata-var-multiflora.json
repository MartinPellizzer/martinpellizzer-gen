It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a slightly serrated margin. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
