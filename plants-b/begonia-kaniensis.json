    "intro": "Begonia kaniensis, commonly known as the Kaniensis begonia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, often bi-colored flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with heart-shaped leaves that have a velvety texture. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental plants. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its natural habitat."
