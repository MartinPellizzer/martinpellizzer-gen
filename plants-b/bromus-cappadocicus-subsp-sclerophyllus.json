    "intro": "Bromus cappadocicus subsp. sclerophyllus, commonly known as the Cappadocian bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems, with leathery, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to form dense vegetation in disturbed or degraded soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in semi-arid regions."
