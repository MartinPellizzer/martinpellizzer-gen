    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. aequifolius, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are arranged in a compact cluster. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
