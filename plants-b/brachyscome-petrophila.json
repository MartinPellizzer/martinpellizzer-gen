    "intro": "Brachyscome petrophila, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Brachyscome petrophila is often found in open grasslands and on rocky slopes at high altitudes."
