It typically grows in rocky and mountainous terrain, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes.
