    "intro": "Berberis sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodberry plant, is a deciduous shrub native to regions of Asia, including China and Russia. It is characterized by its red, berry-like fruits that appear in clusters, which are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. The plant features thorny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, typically appearing in early spring. Berberis sanguinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
