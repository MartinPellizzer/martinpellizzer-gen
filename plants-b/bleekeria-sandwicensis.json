    "intro": "Bleekeria sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian bleekeria, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native environment. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
