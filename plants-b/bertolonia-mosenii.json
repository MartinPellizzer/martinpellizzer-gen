    "intro": "Bertolonia mosenii, commonly known as the Mosenii fern, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
