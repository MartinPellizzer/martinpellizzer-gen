It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Banksia serrifolia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
