    "intro": "Borneocola petiolatus, commonly known as the Bornean petioled fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture. Borneocola petiolatus plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its environment."
