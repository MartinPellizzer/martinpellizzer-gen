    "intro": "Baccharis subulata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, needle-like leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Baccharis subulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
