    "intro": "Bulbophyllum decatriche, commonly known as the feather-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and long, slender inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The flowers typically have three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being modified into a lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
