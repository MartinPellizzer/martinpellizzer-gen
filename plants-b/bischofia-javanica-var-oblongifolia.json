It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and composed of several elliptical to oblong leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
