    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides f. exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
