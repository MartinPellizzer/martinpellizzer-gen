It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
