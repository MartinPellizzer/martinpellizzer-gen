    "intro": "Brunsvigia major, commonly known as the giant pearled lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive pearled appearance. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Brunsvigia major is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and dramatic floral display."
