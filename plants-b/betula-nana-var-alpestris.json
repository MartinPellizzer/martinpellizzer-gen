    "intro": "Betula nana var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dwarf stature, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. The plant has small, triangular leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Its bark is thin and peeling, often appearing in a papery, flaky texture. This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays an important ecological role in tundra and mountain ecosystems."
