    "intro": "Bromus cristatus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a grass species that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant features a tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus cristatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
