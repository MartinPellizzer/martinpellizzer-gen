    "intro": "Bumelia jubilla, commonly known as the red buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Bumelia jubilla is often found in moist, wooded areas and has a somewhat aggressive growth habit. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and landscape design."
