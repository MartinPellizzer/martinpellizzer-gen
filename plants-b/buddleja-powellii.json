    "intro": "Buddleja powellii, commonly known as the Powell's false indigo, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a member of the Oleaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. Buddleja powellii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in appropriate climates."
