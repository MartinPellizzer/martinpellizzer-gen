    "intro": "Bromus inermis f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that are often tinged with purple. The leaves are narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
