    "intro": "Boophone toxicaria, commonly known as the poison bulb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, waxy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It is notable for containing toxic compounds, particularly in its bulbous roots, which can be harmful if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for medicinal use."
