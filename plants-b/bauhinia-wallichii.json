    "intro": "Bauhinia wallichii, commonly known as the Indian peacock flower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, papery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink or purple flowers that resemble peacock feathers, blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia wallichii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
