    "intro": "Bolbitis nigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Bolbitis nigra is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
