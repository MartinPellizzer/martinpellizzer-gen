    "intro": "Blechnum minus subsp. scabrum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a rough, textured surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The subspecies scabrum is distinguished by its coarsely serrated leaf margins and dense, compact growth habit."
