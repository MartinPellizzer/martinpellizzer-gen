    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chrysolabium, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and feature a distinctive lip that is highly modified for pollination. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many regions for horticultural purposes."
