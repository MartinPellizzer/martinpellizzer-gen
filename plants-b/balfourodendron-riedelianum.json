    "intro": "Balfourodendron riedelianum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
