    "intro": "Bulbophyllum acanthoglossum, commonly known as the spiny-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiny lip that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. The orchid has thick, fleshy roots that help it store water in its natural habitat."
