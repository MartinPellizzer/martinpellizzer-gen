    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. multifidum, commonly known as the multifid mouse-ear, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple lobes, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Botrychium obliquum var. multifidum is a rare and ancient plant species, with a unique reproductive structure that reflects its evolutionary history."
