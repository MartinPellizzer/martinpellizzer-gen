    "intro": "Bromheadia robusta, commonly known as the robust bromhead, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many tropical plants known for their striking foliage and blooms. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, emerge from the center of the leaf rosette and are borne on tall, slender stems. Bromheadia robusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
