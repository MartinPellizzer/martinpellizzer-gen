    "intro": "Brachyscome rara, commonly known as the rare dwarf bluebell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features delicate, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in spring, surrounded by fine, white to pale blue bracts. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with small, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
