    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nutans var. pictum, commonly known as the Dancing Orchid, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, raceme-like inflorescence and vibrant, often colorful flowers that resemble dancing figures. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. The varietal form 'pictum' is distinguished by its intricate, patterned petals and sepals, which display a range of hues including red, orange, and yellow."
