It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, pendulous clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both gardens and collections."
