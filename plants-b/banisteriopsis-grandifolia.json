    "intro": "Banisteriopsis grandifolia, commonly known as the \"Amazonian balsam tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The plant is also valued for its role in the ecological dynamics of the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
