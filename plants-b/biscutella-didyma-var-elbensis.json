It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or subalpine regions. It is found primarily in Central Europe, with limited distribution in areas like the Alps and Carpathians. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
