    "intro": "Berchemia hispida var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sand verbena, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
