It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
