    "intro": "Betula castanae, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin layers, revealing a lighter inner bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. The tree prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
