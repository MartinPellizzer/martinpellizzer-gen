    "intro": "Borreria sulcata, commonly known as the rough borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to dry environments, with small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss. Borreria sulcata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
