    "intro": "Bonatea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small evergreen shrub with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Bonatea arabica is closely related to the coffee plant, Coffea arabica, and shares similar cultivation requirements. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its lower yield and smaller size compared to traditional coffee plants."
