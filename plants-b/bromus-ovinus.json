It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Bromus ovinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
