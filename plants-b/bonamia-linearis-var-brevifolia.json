    "intro": "Bonamia linearis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bonamia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, giving it a distinctive, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
