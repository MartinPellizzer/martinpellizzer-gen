    "intro": "Bromus milanjianus, commonly known as the Milanjian's brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus milanjianus is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
