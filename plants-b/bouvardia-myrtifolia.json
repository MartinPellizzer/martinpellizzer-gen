    "intro": "Bouvardia myrtifolia, commonly known as the pink bouvardia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched inflorescences that produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Bouvardia myrtifolia thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and container planting. Its long blooming period, which can last several months, adds continuous color to gardens throughout the growing season."
