    "intro": "Berberis amurensis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Amur barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and garden borders."
