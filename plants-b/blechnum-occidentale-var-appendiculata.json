    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. appendiculata, commonly known as the Pacific fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the Pacific coastal regions of North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil or rock surfaces. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
