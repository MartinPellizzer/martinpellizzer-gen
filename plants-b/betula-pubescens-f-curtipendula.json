    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. curtipendula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a shrub-like form of the white birch. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are male flowers, and female flowers are found in clusters on the same plant. This variety is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions."
