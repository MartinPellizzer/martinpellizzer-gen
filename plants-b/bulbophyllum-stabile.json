    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stabile, commonly known as the stable bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Flowering occurs in the summer, with blooms that can last several weeks, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
