    "intro": "[WRONG START] Boronia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive borbonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Borbonia decipiens is also notable for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions, making it a common understory plant in its native habitat."
