It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structures. The plant typically features woody stems and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are often brightly colored. Its leaves are usually ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
