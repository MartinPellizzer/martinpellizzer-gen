    "intro": "Bugula villosa, commonly known as the hairy bugula, is a species of marine bryozoan found in coastal waters. It forms dense colonies that are often attached to substrates such as rocks or artificial structures. The colony is composed of many small, repeating units called zooids, each with a lophophore used for feeding. Its appearance is characterized by a soft, gelatinous texture with a fuzzy or hairy surface. Bugula villosa plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to benthic biodiversity."
