    "intro": "Bromelia silvestris, commonly known as the wild bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Bromelia silvestris is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests."
