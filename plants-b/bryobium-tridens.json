    "intro": "Bryobium tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a leafy, green upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations called trichomes. Bryobium tridens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms in its ecosystem."
