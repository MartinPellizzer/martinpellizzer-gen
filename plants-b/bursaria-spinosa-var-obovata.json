It features oval-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by distinctive, spiny fruit pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
