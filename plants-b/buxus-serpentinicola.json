    "intro": "Buxus serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentinite boxwood, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, typical of the Buxus genus. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly those derived from serpentinite rock. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Buxus serpentinicola is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its specialized habitat."
