    "intro": "Bistorta burmanica, commonly known as Burmese bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its rhizomatous growth and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features lance-shaped, hairy leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in summer. Bistorta burmanica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported astringent properties."
