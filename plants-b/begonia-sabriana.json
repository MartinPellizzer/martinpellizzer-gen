    "intro": "Begonia sabriana, commonly known as the smooth-leaved begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, broad, and often heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
