    "intro": "Botrychium lineare, commonly known as the linear moonwort, is a small, perennial fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium lineare is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a rare and delicate species, often requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive."
