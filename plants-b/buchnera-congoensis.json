    "intro": "Buchnera congoensis, commonly known as the Congo Buchnera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buchnera congoensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
