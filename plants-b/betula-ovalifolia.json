    "intro": "Betula ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
