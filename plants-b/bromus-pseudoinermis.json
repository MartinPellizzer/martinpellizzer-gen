    "intro": "Bromus pseudoinermis, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Bromus pseudoinermis is often used in agricultural settings for forage and soil stabilization."
