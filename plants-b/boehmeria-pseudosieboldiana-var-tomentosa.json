It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fibrous bark has been traditionally used for making paper and textiles due to its strength and flexibility. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
