    "intro": "Betula nana var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Betula nana var. intermedia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine wildlife species."
