    "intro": "Bubonium graveolens, commonly known as the stinking bishop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Bubonium graveolens is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
