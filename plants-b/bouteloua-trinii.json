    "intro": "Bouteloua trinii, commonly known as trin\u2019s bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Trin\u2019s bluegrass is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
