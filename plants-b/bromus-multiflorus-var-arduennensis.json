    "intro": "Bromus multiflorus var. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
