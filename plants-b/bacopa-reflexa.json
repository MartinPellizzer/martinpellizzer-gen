    "intro": "Bacopa reflexa, commonly known as water bead plant or dwarf bacopa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, blue or violet flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in summer. Bacopa reflexa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
