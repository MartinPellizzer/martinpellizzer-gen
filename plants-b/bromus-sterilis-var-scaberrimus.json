    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous short, awned glumes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
