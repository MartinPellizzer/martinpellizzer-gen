    "intro": "Bolbitis diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Bolbitis diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
