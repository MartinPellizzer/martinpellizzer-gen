    "intro": "Bloomeria crocea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden bloomery, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. The variety 'aurea' is distinguished by its intense golden hue, which sets it apart from other varieties of Bloomeria crocea."
