    "intro": "Bupleurum petraeum f. lonchophorum, commonly known as the rock celery or rock angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as limestone cliffs and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a distinctive bluish-green hue, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
