    "intro": "Beckmannia eruciformis subsp. syzigachne, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations."
