    "intro": "Botrychium lunarioides var. daedaleum, commonly known as the veined moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with a cluster of fertile fronds that bear spore-bearing structures called sorus. Its leaves are divided into a complex arrangement of pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. This variant is notable for its distinctive veining pattern and its role in forest ecosystems as an indicator of undisturbed habitats."
