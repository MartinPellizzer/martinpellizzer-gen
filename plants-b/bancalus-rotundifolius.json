    "intro": "Bancalus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed beetle, is a species of scarab beetle native to various regions in Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, dark brown to black body and distinctive, broad, leaf-like elytra. The plant associated with this beetle is the orchid *Bulbophyllum rotundifolium*, which serves as its primary host. The beetle's larvae develop within the pseudobulbs of the orchid, feeding on its tissues. This plant-beetle relationship highlights the intricate ecological interactions in tropical ecosystems."
