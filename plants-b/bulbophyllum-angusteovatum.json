    "intro": "Bulbophyllum angusteovatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which are specialized stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
