It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
