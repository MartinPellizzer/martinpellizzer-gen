It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant features upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Betonica alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine."
