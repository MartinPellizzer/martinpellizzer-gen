    "intro": "Brasiliopuntia brasiliensis subsp. subacarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian apple cactus, is a succulent plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other members of the Brasiliopuntia genus. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
