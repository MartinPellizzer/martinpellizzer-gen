    "intro": "Bryonia dioica, commonly known as wild turnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that mature to a dark green or purple color. Its leaves are lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are hairy and often have a faintly aromatic scent. Bryonia dioica is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine, though its latex is toxic."
