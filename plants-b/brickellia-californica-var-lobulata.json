    "intro": "Brickellia californica var. lobulata, commonly known as California brickellbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
