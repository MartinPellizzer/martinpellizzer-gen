    "intro": "Balanophora alveolata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is found only in specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it grows on the roots of trees in humid, shaded environments."
