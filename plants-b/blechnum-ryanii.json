    "intro": "Blechnum ryanii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
