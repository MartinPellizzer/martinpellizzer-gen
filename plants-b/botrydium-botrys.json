    "intro": "Botrydium botrys, commonly known as the bladder worts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic liverworts. It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure and small, bladder-like structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as ponds, ditches, and damp soil. Botrydium botrys has a widespread distribution across temperate regions and is often found in freshwater habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
