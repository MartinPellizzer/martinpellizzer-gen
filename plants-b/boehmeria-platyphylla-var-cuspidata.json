    "intro": "Boehmeria platyphylla var. cuspidata, commonly known as the broadleaf nettle, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The fibers of its stems are used in traditional crafts and textiles due to their strength and flexibility."
