    "intro": "Bromus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, tufted culms with spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Bromus weberbaueri is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
