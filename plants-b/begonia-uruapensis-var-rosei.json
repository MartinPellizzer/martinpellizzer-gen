    "intro": "Begonia uruapensis var. rosei, commonly known as the rose begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features vibrant, semi-evergreen foliage with a deep green hue and striking, rose-colored bracts that add a dramatic visual appeal. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
