    "intro": "Bonafousia tessmannii, commonly known as the African mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bonafousia tessmannii is considered endangered in its native range."
