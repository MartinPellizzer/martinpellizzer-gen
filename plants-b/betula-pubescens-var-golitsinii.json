    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. golitsinii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a variant of the white birch native to cold climates in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that often peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers and is well adapted to harsh, northern environments. It is often found in taiga regions and can thrive in poor, acidic soils. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
