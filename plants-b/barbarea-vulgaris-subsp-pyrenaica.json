    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean wintercress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its seeds are small and contain a high concentration of glucosinolates, which contribute to its peppery flavor. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
