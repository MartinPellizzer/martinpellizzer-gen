It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typical of the Betula genus. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is well adapted to periglacial conditions. Its presence is often indicative of tundra or alpine habitats."
