    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oxyanthum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Bulbophyllum oxyanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
