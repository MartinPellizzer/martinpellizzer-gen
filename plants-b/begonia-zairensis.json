    "intro": "Begonia zairensis, commonly known as the Zaire begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often displaying a rich green color with intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
