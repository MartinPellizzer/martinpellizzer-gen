    "intro": "Blepharis myresii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that open in the early morning. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet in color and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces seeds in slender, spiraled pods. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
