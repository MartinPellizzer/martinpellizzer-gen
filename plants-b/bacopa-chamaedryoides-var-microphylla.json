    "intro": "Bacopa chamaedryoides var. microphylla, commonly known as dwarf bacopa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in water gardens and as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit and ornamental value."
