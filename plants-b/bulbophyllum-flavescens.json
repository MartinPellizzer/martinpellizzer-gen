    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces multiple racemes of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent lip petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Bulbophyllum flavescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
