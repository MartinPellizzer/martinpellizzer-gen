    "intro": "Biserrula pelecinus var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth biserrula, is a leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves distinguish it from other varieties of biserrula. It is often used as a forage crop due to its nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
