It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is often found in areas with consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soils."
