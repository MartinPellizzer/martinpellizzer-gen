    "intro": "Bulbophyllum habbemense, commonly known as the Habbem's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like stems that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
