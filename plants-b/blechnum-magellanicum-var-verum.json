    "intro": "Blechnum magellanicum var. verum, commonly known as the Magellanic harts-tongue fern, is a variety of the harts-tongue fern native to South America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, elongated, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
