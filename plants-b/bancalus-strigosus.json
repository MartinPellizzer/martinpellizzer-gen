    "intro": "Bancalus strigosus, commonly known as the black-tailed stag beetle, is a species of scarab beetle found in various parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy elytra and elongated body, which are typical features of the Scarabaeidae family. The larvae of this species are often found in decaying wood, where they play a role in breaking down organic matter. Adult beetles are typically active at night and are attracted to light sources. This species contributes to the ecological balance by aiding in the decomposition process and serving as a food source for other animals."
