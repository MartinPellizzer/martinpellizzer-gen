    "intro": "Betonica officinalis var. serotina, commonly known as late betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces upright stems with whorled leaves. Its flowers, which are blue to purple in color, bloom in late summer and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Betonica officinalis var. serotina has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
