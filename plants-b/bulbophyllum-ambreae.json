    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ambreae, commonly known as the red-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lip-like petals that display vibrant red and orange hues. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
