    "intro": "Blechnum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The Norfolk fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
