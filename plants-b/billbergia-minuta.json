    "intro": "Billbergia minuta, commonly known as the miniature billbergia, is a small bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can last several months, featuring vibrant red or orange flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia minuta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
