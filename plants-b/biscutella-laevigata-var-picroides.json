    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. picroides, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. This variety is often found in open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes."
