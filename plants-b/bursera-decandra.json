    "intro": "Bursera decandra, commonly known as the Mexican frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The plant typically has smooth, grayish bark and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and incense production."
