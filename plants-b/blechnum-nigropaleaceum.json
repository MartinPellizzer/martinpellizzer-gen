    "intro": "Blechnum nigropaleaceum, commonly known as the black-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, contrasting veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
