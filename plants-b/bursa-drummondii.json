    "intro": "Bursa drummondii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seed pods are distinctive, resembling small, inflated pouches that split open to release seeds. Bursa drummondii is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
