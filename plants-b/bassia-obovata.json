    "intro": "Bassia obovata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with bluish-gray leaves that are obovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and has deep roots to access water from below the soil surface. Bassia obovata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
