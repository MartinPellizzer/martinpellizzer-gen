    "intro": "Bakoa lucens, commonly known as the luminous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a faint luminescent glow under moonlight. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are upright and branching. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Bakoa lucens is considered a rare and endangered species."
