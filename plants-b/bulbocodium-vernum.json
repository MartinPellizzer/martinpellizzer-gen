    "intro": "Bulbocodium vernum, commonly known as spring snowball, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its clustered white flowers that bloom early in the spring. The plant produces small, bulbous structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early blooming make it a notable wildflower in temperate regions."
