    "intro": "Begonia villifolia, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or hang from containers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its heart-shaped leaves are often adorned with distinctive veins and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Begonia villifolia is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade with consistent moisture."
