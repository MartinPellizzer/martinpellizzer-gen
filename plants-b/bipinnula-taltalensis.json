    "intro": "Bipinnula taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
