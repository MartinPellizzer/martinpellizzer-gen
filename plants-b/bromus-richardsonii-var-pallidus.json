    "intro": "Bromus richardsonii var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. It is an important forage plant for livestock and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
