    "intro": "Bromelia gigantea, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Due to its size and visual impact, Bromelia gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
