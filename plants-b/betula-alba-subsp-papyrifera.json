    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. papyrifera, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, which is a key botanical feature. The tree has slender, often pendulous branches and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
