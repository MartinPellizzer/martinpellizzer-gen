    "intro": "Betula humilis var. oycowiensis, commonly known as the Oycowian birch, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically grayish-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among birch species. Its bark is thin and peels in a papery manner, similar to other birches, and it thrives in cold, dry climates. Betula humilis var. oycowiensis is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
