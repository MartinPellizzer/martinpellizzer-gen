    "intro": "Betula davurica f. tiliifolia, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
