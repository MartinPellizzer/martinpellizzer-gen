    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. communis, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and orange beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval and serrated, turning gold to reddish-brown in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
