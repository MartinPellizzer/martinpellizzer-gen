    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy rhizome, which supports its unique morphology. The plant produces a single, large, heart-shaped sporophyll that bears two clusters of sporangia, each containing spores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium virginianum subsp. typicum is found throughout much of North America and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
