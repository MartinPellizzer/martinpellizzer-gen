    "intro": "Baccharis incarum, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It has aromatic leaves that release a strong scent when crushed, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Baccharis incarum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
