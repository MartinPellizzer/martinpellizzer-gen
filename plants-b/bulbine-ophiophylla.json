It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the shape of a snake's tongue. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
