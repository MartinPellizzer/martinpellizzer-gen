    "intro": "Bactris hirta var. pulchra, commonly known as the pink pineapple, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, waxy, pinkish-purple bracts that resemble the leaves of a pineapple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet, and fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
