    "intro": "Billbergia rohaniana, commonly known as the Rohan's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that form a central rosette, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, spathaceous flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia rohaniana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
