    "intro": "Bromus scoparius var. alopecuros, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ornamental horticulture due to its delicate, lawn-like appearance."
