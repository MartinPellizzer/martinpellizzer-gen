    "intro": "Begonia oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant color and texture. Begonia oxyphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds."
