    "intro": "Bulbophyllum xanthophaeum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and compact, pseudobulb-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum xanthophaeum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
