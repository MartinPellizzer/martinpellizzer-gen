It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or violet and bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
