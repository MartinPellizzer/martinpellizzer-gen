    "intro": "Betula glandulosa var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid birch, is a variant of the glandular birch native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaf buds and smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a serrated margin. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it identifiable and valuable for ecological studies and landscape use."
