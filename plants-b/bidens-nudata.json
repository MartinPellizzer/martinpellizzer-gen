    "intro": "Bidens nudata, commonly known as the slender beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, linear leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it can be considered a weed in some regions."
