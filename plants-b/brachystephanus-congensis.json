    "intro": "Brachystephanus congensis, commonly known as the Congo stephanus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
