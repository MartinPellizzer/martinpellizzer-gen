    "intro": "Bupleurum commutatum var. pachnospermum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
