    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tetratropis, commonly known as the four-angled Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its bulb-like structures, which store water and nutrients, are a key feature of its morphology. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination."
