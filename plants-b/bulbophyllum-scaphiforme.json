    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scaphiforme, commonly known as the boat-shaped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, boat-shaped pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapting to its climbing habit. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
