    "intro": "Bouteloua chasei, commonly known as black grama, is a native grass species found primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flower clusters that are typically brown or reddish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock. Due to its drought tolerance and hardiness, it is a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems."
