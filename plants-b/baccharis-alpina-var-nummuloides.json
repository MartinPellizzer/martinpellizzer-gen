    "intro": "Baccharis alpina var. nummuloides, commonly known as the Alpine Baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
