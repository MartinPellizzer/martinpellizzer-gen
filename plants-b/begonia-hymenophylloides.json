    "intro": "Begonia hymenophylloides, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges in color from deep green to dark purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a splash of color to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
