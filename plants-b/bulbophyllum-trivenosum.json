It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The flowers typically bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to this unique orchid species."
