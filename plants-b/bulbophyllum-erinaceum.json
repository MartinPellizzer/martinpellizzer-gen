    "intro": "Bulbophyllum erinaceum, commonly known as the spiny orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, spiny pseudobulbs and linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow or greenish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum erinaceum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
