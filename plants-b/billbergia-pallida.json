    "intro": "Billbergia pallida, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically pale green or white, bloom in the summer and are followed by red berries. Billbergia pallida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
