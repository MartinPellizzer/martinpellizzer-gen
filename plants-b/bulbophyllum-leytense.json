    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leytense, commonly known as the Leyte Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within lowland forests. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, with a unique labellum structure. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
