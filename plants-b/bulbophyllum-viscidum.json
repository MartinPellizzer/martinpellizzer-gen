    "intro": "Bulbophyllum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves help in capturing moisture and deterring herbivores."
