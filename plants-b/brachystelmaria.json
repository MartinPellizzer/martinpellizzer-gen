    "intro": "Brachystelmaria, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brachystelmaria is considered a rare and endangered species."
