    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ruficaudatum, commonly known as the red-tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red sepals and petals, which give it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are often fragrant and appear in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
