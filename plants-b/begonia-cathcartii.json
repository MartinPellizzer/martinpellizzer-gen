    "intro": "Begonia cathcartii, commonly known as the Cathcart's begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep red to variegated green. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia cathcartii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
