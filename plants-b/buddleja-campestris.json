    "intro": "Buddleja campestris, commonly known as the field buddleja, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, woody stems that often branch out into clusters of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces panicles of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja campestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
