    "intro": "Buchnera cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed buchnera, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Buchnera cuneifolia is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic contexts."
