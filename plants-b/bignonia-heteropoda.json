It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its cascading clusters of yellow-orange tubular flowers. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant blooms. Bignonia heteropoda is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
