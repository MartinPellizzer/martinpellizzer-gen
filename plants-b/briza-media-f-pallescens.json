    "intro": "Briza media f. pallescens, commonly known as the silver false oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet environments. It features slender, arching stems with narrow, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in wet meadows, pond margins, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
