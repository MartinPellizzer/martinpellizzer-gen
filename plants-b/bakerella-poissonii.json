It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of smaller, darker yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Bakerella poissonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive, daisy-like appearance."
