    "intro": "Bulliarda recurva, commonly known as the curly bulliard, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its wiry, ascending stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Bulliarda recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique, curling foliage."
