    "intro": "Bletia cordata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall spike of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Bletia cordata thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
