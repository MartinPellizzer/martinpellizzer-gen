    "intro": "Bromus ramosus var. corniculatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
