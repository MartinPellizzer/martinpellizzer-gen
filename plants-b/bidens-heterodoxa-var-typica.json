    "intro": "Bidens heterodoxa var. typica, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers with five petals. Its seeds are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
