    "intro": "Braya aenea, commonly known as silverleaf whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Braya aenea is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
