    "intro": "Bacopa repens, commonly known as inch plant or dollar plant, is a trailing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bacopa repens is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to cascade from hanging baskets or containers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun."
