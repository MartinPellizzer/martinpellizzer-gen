    "intro": "Boea brachycarpa, commonly known as the Chinese ivy or rock ivy, is a climbing perennial vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Boea brachycarpa thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures or cover rocky surfaces."
