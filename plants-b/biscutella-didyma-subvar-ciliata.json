    "intro": "Biscutella didyma subvar. ciliata, commonly known as the fringed biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves with finely ciliate margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
