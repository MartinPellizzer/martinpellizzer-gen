    "intro": "Brassica botterii, commonly known as desert mustang grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert scrub or grassland habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers in racemes during the spring. It is adapted to drought conditions and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Brassica botterii is also known for its use in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
