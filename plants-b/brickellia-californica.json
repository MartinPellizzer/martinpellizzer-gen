    "intro": "Brickellia californica, commonly known as California brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia californica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
