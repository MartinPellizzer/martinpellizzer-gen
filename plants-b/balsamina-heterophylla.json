    "intro": "Balsamina heterophylla, commonly known as the variable balsam, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning its leaves vary in shape depending on light conditions, with submerged leaves being filamentous and aerial leaves being broader. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquatic and bog gardens."
