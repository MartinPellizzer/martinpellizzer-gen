    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. typicum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern-like plant native to North America. It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called soruses, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually divided into two parts, with the upper leaflet being smaller and more upright. Botrychium virginianum var. typicum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
