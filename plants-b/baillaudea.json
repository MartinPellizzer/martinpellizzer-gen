    "intro": "Baillaudea, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and yellow. They have thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, making them well-suited for drought conditions. Baillaudea species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
