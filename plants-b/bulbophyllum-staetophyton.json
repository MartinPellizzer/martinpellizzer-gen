    "intro": "Bulbophyllum staetophyton, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy roots adapted for water storage. Its flowers are typically small, with a greenish-yellow color and a distinctive, narrow lip. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
