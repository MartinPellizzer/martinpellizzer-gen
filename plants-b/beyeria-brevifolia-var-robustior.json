    "intro": "Beyeria brevifolia var. robustior, commonly known as the robust dwarf cycad, is a compact cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a rosette of narrow, glossy green leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically emerging from the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
