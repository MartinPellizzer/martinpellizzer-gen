    "intro": "Blotiella javanica, commonly known as the Javanese bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, appearing in clusters. Blotiella javanica is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
