    "intro": "Brodiaea brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed brodiaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to California and Baja California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, round bulbs that serve as storage organs and help the plant survive in arid conditions. Brodiaea brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
