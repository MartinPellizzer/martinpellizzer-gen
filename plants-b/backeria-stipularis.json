It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has distinctive stipules that are often lobed or toothed, giving it its common name. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including insects and mammals. Backeria stipularis typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in savannas and grasslands."
