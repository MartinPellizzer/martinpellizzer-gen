    "intro": "Bulbulus nervatus, commonly known as the narrow-veined bulbul, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its small, narrow leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
