    "intro": "Bauhinia rhododendriflora, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a deciduous legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that resemble those of rhododendrons, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and often turn yellow before falling in autumn. It produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia rhododendriflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a street tree due to its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in tropical climates."
