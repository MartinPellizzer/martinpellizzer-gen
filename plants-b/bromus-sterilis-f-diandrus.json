    "intro": "Bromus sterilis f. diandrus, commonly known as the sterile brome, is a botanical variant of the species Bromus sterilis. It is a grass species characterized by its reduced fertility, often exhibiting a unique floral structure compared to the typical form. This form is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic variant that contributes to the study of plant adaptation and reproductive strategies."
