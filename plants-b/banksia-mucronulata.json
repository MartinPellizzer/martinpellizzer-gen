    "intro": "Banksia mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in heathland and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow flowers. Banksia mucronulata is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with lignotubers that allow it to resprout after bushfires. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects."
