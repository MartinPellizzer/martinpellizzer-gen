    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron borneense, commonly known as the Bornean boerlagia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
