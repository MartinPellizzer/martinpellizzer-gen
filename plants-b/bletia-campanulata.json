    "intro": "Bletia campanulata, commonly known as the bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the dappled light. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the year in some regions. Bletia campanulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
