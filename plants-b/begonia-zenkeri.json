    "intro": "Begonia zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to variegated patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
