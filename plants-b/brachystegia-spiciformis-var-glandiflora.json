    "intro": "Brachystegia spiciformis var. glandiflora, commonly known as the glandular brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with glandular dots along the veins, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in miombo woodlands. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
