    "intro": "Berberis campos-portoi, commonly known as the Campos-Portoi barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
