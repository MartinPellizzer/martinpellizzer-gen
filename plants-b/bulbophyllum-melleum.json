    "intro": "Bulbophyllum melleum, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that resemble small, yellowish-brown blossoms. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Bulbophyllum melleum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and distinctive appearance."
