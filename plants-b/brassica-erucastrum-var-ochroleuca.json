    "intro": "Brassica erucastrum var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white cabbage butterfly plant, is a variety of the Brassica genus native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically green with a white or pale underside. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. This variety is notable for its role in supporting the life cycle of the cabbage white butterfly, *Pieris rapae*."
