    "intro": "Bulbophyllum luederwaldtii, commonly known as the Luederwaldt's orchid, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
