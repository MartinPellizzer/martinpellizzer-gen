It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often palmately lobed leaves that are usually smooth and entire. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fluffy, white or pale pink fruit clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its fibrous bark and leaves have been historically used in traditional crafts and papermaking."
