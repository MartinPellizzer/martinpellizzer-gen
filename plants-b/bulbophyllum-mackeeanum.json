    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mackeeanum, commonly known as the Mackee's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
