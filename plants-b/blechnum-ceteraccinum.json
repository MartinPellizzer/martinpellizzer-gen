It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are often recurved or folded. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus. The leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
