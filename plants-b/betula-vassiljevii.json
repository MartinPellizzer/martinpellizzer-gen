    "intro": "Betula vassiljevii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and open areas. Betula vassiljevii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
