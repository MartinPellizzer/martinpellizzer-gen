It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives on the surfaces of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Broughtonia alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
