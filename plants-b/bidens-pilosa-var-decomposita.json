    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. decomposita, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are usually opposite, with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
