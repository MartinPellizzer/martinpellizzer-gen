    "intro": "Bulbophyllum streptotriche, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright red bracts and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, adapted to photosynthesis in shaded environments. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for terrariums and greenhouses."
