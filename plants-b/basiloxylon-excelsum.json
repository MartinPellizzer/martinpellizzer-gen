    "intro": "Basiloxylon excelsum, commonly known as the celestial cedar, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, aromatic leaves that emit a subtle mint-like scent. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique growth pattern and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest for botanists and herbalists alike. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Basiloxylon excelsum is now classified as a vulnerable species."
