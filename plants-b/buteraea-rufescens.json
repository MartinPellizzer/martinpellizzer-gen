    "intro": "Buteraea rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Buteraea rufescens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
