    "intro": "Bogoria merrillii, commonly known as the African bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the wetlands of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a consistently moist environment to survive. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged substrate, which is typical of bog ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Bogoria merrillii is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in extreme conditions."
