    "intro": "Bombax affine, commonly known as the cotton tree or silky cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a fibrous, spiny capsule. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. Bombax affine is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
