    "intro": "Brachythalamus caudatus, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
