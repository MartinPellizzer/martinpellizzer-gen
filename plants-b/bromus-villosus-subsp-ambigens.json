    "intro": "Bromus villosus subsp. ambigens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, with short, awned lemmas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
