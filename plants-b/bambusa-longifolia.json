    "intro": "Bambusa longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf bamboo, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 15 meters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. Its rhizomes are robust and help in the propagation of the plant through clumping growth. Bambusa longifolia is valued for its strength and is often used in construction and handicrafts."
