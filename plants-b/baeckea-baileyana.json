    "intro": "Baeckea baileyana, commonly known as the golden baeckea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual element to gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Baeckea baileyana is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
