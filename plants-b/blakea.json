These plants are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. Blakea species typically have opposite, ovate leaves and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture due to their compact growth habit and vibrant floral display."
