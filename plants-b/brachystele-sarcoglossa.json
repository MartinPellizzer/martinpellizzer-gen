    "intro": "Brachystele sarcoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sarcoglossa, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a short, upright rhizome with numerous slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely divided, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
