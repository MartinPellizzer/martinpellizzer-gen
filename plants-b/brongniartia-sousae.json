    "intro": "Brongniartia sousae, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family, which includes trees and shrubs known for their showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
