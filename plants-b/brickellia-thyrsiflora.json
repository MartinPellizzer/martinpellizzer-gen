    "intro": "Brickellia thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thrysothyrse brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Brickellia thyrsiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
