It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces aromatic, seed-like structures called schizocarps, which are often used in culinary applications. Barcella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its growth habit is perennial, with a lifecycle that includes both vegetative and reproductive stages throughout the growing season."
