    "intro": "Banisteria thyrsoidea, commonly known as the red-stemmed bignonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive red stems that contrast with its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a slightly waxy texture, while its bark is rough and fissured. Banisteria thyrsoidea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
