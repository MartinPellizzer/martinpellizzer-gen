    "intro": "Boscia viridiflava, commonly known as the green-flowered boscia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stem and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Boscia viridiflava is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
