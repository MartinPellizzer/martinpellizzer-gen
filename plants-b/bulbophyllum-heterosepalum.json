    "intro": "Bulbophyllum heterosepalum, commonly known as the variable lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that is often heterosepaled, meaning it has two differently shaped sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The genus Bulbophyllum is known for its diverse morphology, and B. heterosepalum exemplifies this with its striking and variable floral displays."
