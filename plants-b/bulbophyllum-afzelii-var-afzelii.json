    "intro": "Bulbophyllum afzelii var. afzelii, commonly known as the African violet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically dark green and velvety, with a waxy coating. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is often more brightly colored than the rest of the flower."
