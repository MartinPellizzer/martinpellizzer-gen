    "intro": "Biscutella lyrata var. raphanifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved biscutella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, lyrate-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
