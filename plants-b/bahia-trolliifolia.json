    "intro": "Bahia trolliifolia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Bahia trolliifolia is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
