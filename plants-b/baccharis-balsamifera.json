    "intro": "Baccharis balsamifera, commonly known as balsam weed, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a resinous scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Baccharis balsamifera is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various small animals."
