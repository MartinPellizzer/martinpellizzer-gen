    "intro": "Broughtonia lilacina, commonly known as the lilac orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Broughtonia lilacina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
