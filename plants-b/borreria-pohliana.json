It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Borreria pohliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
