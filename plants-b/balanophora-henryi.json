    "intro": "Balanophora henryi, commonly known as the Henry's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and mysterious botanical species."
