    "intro": "Bauhinia angulosa, commonly known as the angular bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular leaves that are often lobed and have a papery texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Bauhinia angulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
