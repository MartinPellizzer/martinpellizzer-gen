    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. neglectus, commonly known as the neglected brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, erect stems with spikelets arranged in racemes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, pale green to brown seeds. It is considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
