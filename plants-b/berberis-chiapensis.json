    "intro": "Berberis chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapan barberry, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, glossy green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
