    "intro": "Boswellia serrata var. bivalvis, commonly known as Indian frankincense or gugul, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of India, Pakistan, and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested by making incisions in the bark. This resin has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The botanical features of B. serrata var. bivalvis make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
