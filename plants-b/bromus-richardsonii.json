It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Bromus richardsonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
