It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
