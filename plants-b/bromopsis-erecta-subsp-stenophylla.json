    "intro": "Bromopsis erecta subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Due to its fine texture and dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture and turfgrass mixtures."
