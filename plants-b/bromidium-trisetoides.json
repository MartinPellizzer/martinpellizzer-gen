    "intro": "Bromidium trisetoides, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Bromidium trisetoides is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
