    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana f. coerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered Bermuda grass, is a rare and unique variant of the Bermuda grass species. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flower heads, which distinguish it from the typical green or brown flowers of the standard variety. This form is native to the Caribbean and is often found in coastal areas with sandy soils. The plant is low-growing and forms dense mats, making it an effective ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable botanical specimen."
