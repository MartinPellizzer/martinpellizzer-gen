    "intro": "Baccharis berberidifolia, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
