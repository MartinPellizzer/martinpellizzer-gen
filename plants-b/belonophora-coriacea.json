    "intro": "Belonophora coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features erect, branching stems that are covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Belonophora coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
