    "intro": "Burmannia distachya, commonly known as the red ginger or blood lily, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Burmannia distachya is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
