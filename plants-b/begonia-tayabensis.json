    "intro": "Begonia tayabensis, commonly known as the Tayab begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
