    "intro": "Boykinia occidentalis, commonly known as the western rockfoam, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
