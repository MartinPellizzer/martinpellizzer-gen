    "intro": "Bidens incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of two, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as roadsides and wetlands. Bidens incisa is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in some regions."
