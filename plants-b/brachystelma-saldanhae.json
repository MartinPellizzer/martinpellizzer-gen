It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rock-dwelling growth habit. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
