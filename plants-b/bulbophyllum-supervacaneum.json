    "intro": "Bulbophyllum supervacaneum, commonly known as the Vacanese orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
