    "intro": "Baptisia uniflora, commonly known as false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy blue or purple flower clusters. The plant produces small, pea-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Baptisia uniflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
