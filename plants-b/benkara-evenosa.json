    "intro": "Benkara evenosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Benkara evenosa is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for agricultural management."
