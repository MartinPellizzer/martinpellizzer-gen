    "intro": "Bromus parvispiculatus, commonly known as the small-headed brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, awned glumes, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Bromus parvispiculatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native environment."
