    "intro": "Blechnum microlomaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to form dense mats, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is generally found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
