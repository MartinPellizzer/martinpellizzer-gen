    "intro": "Bromus rigidus var. minor, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to survive in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded environments."
