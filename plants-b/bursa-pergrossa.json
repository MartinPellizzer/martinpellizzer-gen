    "intro": "Bursa pergrossa, commonly known as the large burr plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, seed-bearing structures called burrs, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Bursa pergrossa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique seed pods."
