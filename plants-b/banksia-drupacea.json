    "intro": "Banksia drupacea, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Banksia drupacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
