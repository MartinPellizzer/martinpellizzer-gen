It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This variety is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and woodland habitats."
