It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, and it is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Bossiaea lenticularis is often found in coastal areas and is a common component of shrubland ecosystems."
