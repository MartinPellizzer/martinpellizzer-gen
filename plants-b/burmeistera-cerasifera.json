    "intro": "Burmeistera cerasifera, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Burmeistera cerasifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
