It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are small and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Boucerosia quadrangula is also noted for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring."
