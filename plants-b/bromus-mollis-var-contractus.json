    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed spikelets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus mollis var. contractus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
