It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically bright green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its trailing habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for container gardening and hanging baskets."
