    "intro": "Bulbophyllum versicolor, commonly known as the Variable Lipstick Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that can range from red to yellow, pink, and white, making it highly ornamental. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a unique pattern of color variation across the petals."
