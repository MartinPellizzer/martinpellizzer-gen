    "intro": "Bonduc, commonly known as the Indian chickpea or *Cajanus cajan*, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods containing one or two kidney-shaped seeds. The plant is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in arid conditions, making it an important crop in semi-arid regions. Its seeds are rich in protein and are used in various cuisines, particularly in South Asia. The plant also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
