    "intro": "Burretiodendron yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan burretiodendron, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, lantern-like inflorescences. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments within mountainous regions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
