It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
