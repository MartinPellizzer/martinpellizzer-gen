    "intro": "Brizopyrum prostratum var. erectum, commonly known as upright sheep's beard, is a variant of the sheep's beard plant characterized by its upright growth habit rather than the prostrate form of the typical species. It is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
