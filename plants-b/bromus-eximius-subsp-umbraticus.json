    "intro": "Bromus eximius subsp. umbraticus, commonly known as the shade bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its growth habit is characterized by a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and colonize disturbed or shaded soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in suitable climates."
