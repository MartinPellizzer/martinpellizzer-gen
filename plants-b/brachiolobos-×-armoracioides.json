    "intro": "Brachiolobos \u00d7 armoracioides, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is a cross between Brachiolobos and Armoracanthus, two genera within the family Buxaceae. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is often used as a foundation plant or in mixed borders."
