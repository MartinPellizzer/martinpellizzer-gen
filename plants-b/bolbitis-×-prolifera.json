    "intro": "Bolbitis \u00d7 prolifera, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Bolbitis heterophylla and Bolbitis cuneifolia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
