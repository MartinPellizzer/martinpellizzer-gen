    "intro": "Biophytum chocoense, commonly known as the Chocolate Plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Biophytum chocoense is a member of the Bryophyllum genus, which is known for its ability to propagate through leaf rosettes. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
