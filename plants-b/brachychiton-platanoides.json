    "intro": "Brachychiton platanoides, commonly known as the Sydney flame tree, is a striking ornamental tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a distinctive, broad, fan-shaped canopy and thick, corky bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Brachychiton platanoides is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil types."
