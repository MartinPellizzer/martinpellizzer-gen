    "intro": "Buchloe dactyloides, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a native perennial grass species of the United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Buffalo grass is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its adaptability and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping and turfgrass applications."
