    "intro": "Bassia polyantha, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant and well adapted to sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
