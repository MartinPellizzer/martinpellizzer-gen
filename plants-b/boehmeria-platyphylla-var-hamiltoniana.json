It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. This species is often used in traditional medicine and has also been studied for its potential in textile production due to its strong, fibrous stems."
