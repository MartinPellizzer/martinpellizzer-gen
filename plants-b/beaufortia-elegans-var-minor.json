It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray in appearance, giving it a distinctive, drought-tolerant appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
