    "intro": "Brassica repanda subsp. dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos mustard, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
