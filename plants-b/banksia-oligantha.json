    "intro": "Banksia oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce abundant yellow to orange flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and heathland environments. Banksia oligantha plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
