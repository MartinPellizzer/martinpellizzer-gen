It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
