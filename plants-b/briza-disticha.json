    "intro": "Briza disticha, commonly known as the common wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feather-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Briza disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
