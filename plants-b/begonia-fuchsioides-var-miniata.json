It features heart-shaped leaves with striking variegation of cream and green, and small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative foliage plant due to its ornamental leaves. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
