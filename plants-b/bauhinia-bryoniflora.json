    "intro": "Bauhinia bryoniflora, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Bauhinia bryoniflora thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
