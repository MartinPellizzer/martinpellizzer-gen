It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Breweria mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping."
