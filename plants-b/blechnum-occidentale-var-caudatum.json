It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a unique, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elongated shape at the tips. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
