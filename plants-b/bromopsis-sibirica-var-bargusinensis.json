The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, three-parted flowers that are pollinated by wind. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
