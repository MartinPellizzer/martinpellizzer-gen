    "intro": "Baumea, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Baumea articulata, which is native to New Zealand. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. They typically grow in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in wetlands. Baumea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori weaving."
