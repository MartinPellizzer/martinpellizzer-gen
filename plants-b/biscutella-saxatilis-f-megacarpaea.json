    "intro": "Biscutella saxatilis f. megacarpaea, commonly known as the large-seeded biscuitroot, is a variant of the biscuitroot plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes. The most distinctive feature of this form is its enlarged, fleshy fruits, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
