    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. gomboczii, commonly known as the Hungarian foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to the Pannonian Basin of Hungary. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is well adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are flat and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it has a fibrous root system. This variety is sometimes cultivated for forage but is also considered a weed in certain agricultural settings."
