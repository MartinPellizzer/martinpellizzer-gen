    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium var. tenebrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often appear in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a serrated margin that contributes to its unique appearance. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a common sight in forest understories."
