    "intro": "Baccharis farallonensis, commonly known as Farallon bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and its use in ecological restoration projects."
