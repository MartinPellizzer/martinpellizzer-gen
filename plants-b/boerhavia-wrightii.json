    "intro": "Boerhavia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in dry landscapes."
