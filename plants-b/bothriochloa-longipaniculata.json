    "intro": "Bothriochloa longipaniculata, commonly known as the long-panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in panicles. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riparian zones. Bothriochloa longipaniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
