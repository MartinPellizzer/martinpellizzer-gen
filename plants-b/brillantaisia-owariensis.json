    "intro": "Brillantaisia owariensis, commonly known as the Owariensis Brillantaisia, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a glossy texture, while its flowers come in shades of pink and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
