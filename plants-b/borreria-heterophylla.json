    "intro": "Borreria heterophylla, commonly known as the Mexican heather or false heather, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Borreria heterophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
