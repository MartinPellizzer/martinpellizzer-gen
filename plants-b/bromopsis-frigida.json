    "intro": "Bromopsis frigida, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It is characterized by its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including frost and strong winds. Bromopsis frigida plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
