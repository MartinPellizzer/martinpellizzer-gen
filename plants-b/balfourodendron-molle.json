    "intro": "Balfourodendron molle, commonly known as the velvetleaf balfourodendron, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
