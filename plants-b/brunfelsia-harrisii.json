    "intro": "Brunfelsia harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive white or yellow throat. These flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal."
