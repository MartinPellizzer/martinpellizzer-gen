It features lance-shaped leaves with a pubescent underside, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, making it highly tolerant of fluctuating water levels. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
