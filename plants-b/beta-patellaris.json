    "intro": "Beta patellaris, commonly known as the Patellarian beet, is a lesser-known species within the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically reddish in color, though they can vary depending on environmental conditions. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
