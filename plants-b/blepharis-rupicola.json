    "intro": "Blepharis rupicola, commonly known as the rock blepharis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
