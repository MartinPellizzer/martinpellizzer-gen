    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or humus-rich substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
