    "intro": "Bryonia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf bryony, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces toxic, orange berries that are often used in traditional medicine, though they must be handled with care. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its name reflects both its leaf shape and its historical use in herbal remedies."
