    "intro": "Betula hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that becomes more prominent with age. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Betula hybrida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are triangular in shape with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in the fall."
