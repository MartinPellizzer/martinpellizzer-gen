    "intro": "Bakerisideroxylon cinereum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its use in furniture and traditional crafts. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
