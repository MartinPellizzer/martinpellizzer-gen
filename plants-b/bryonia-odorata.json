    "intro": "Bryonia odorata, commonly known as wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces yellow flowers and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Bryonia odorata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and has been used historically in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
