    "intro": "Brassica capitala, commonly known as the Romanesco cauliflower, is a unique member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, fractal-like inflorescence composed of tightly packed, lime-green flower buds. The plant typically grows to a height of 40\u201380 cm, with dark green, waxy leaves that are slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and yellow, emerging in a spiral pattern that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. Brassica capitala is cultivated for its edible flower heads, which are prized in culinary applications for their mild, nutty flavor."
