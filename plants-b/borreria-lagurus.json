    "intro": "Borreria lagurus, commonly known as the Mexican heather, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is evergreen, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Borreria lagurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
