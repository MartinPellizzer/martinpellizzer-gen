    "intro": "Benzoin latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf benzoin, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a fragrant resin, which is often harvested for its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique scent, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for commercial resin production."
