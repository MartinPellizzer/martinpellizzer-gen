    "intro": "Blechnum bradei, commonly known as the Brade's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin, making it a visually striking ornamental plant. Blechnum bradei prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
