    "intro": "Boniodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered boniodendron, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy coating. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are pale green to yellowish in color, and they emit a mild, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
