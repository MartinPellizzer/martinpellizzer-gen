    "intro": "Betula gmelinii, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula gmelinii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
