    "intro": "Bugranopsis tournefortii, commonly known as the Canary Island rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Bugranopsis tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
