    "intro": "Bartlettina tenorae, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
