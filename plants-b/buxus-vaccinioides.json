    "intro": "Buxus vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage that is typically glossy and highly aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
