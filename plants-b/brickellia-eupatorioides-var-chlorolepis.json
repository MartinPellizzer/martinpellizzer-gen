    "intro": "Brickellia eupatorioides var. chlorolepis, commonly known as blue brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive blue-gray underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is valued in native gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
