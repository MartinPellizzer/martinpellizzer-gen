    "intro": "Bassia anisacanthoides, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize sandy soils effectively. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
