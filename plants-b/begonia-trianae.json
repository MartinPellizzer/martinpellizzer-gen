    "intro": "Begonia trianae, commonly known as the Trianza begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean region of South America. It features striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and silver. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shady garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
