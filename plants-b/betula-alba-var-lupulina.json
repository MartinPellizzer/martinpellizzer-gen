    "intro": "Betula alba var. lupulina, commonly known as the white birch, is a variant of the white birch tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
