    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 margaritae, commonly known as the pearl begonia, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and a deep green color, often with a slight reddish tinge. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
