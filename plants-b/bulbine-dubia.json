    "intro": "Bulbine dubia, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Bulbine dubia is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
