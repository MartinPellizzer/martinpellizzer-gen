    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kittredgei, commonly known as the Kittredge's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
