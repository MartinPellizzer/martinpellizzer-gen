    "intro": "Bistorta macrophylla, commonly known as broad-leaved bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rhizomatous root system and upright, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Bistorta macrophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
