    "intro": "Brosimum potabile, commonly known as the \"drinking tree\" or \"potable tree,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its most notable feature is the production of a milky, latex-like sap that was historically used by indigenous peoples for its purported medicinal and intoxicating properties. The sap contains compounds that can have psychoactive effects, making it a subject of both botanical and ethnobotanical interest."
