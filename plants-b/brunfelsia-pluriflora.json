    "intro": "Brunfelsia pluriflora, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces showy, lantern-like fruits that turn from green to orange-red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
