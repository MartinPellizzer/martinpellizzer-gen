    "intro": "Banksia sericeovillosa, commonly known as the silky woolly banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to western and southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, silky, white to greyish hairs covering the young stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, cone-like inflorescences that bear numerous yellow to orange flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Banksia sericeovillosa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands."
