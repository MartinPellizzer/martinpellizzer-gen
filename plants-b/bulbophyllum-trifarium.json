    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trifarium, commonly known as the Three-lobed Pterostigma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed lip that resembles a pterostigma, a feature that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum trifarium is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
