    "intro": "Bertya dimerostigma var. cupressoidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf bertya, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Australia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
