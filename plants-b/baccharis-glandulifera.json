    "intro": "Baccharis glandulifera, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds when mature. Baccharis glandulifera is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
