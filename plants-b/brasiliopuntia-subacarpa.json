    "intro": "Brasiliopuntia subacarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments with well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
