    "intro": "Brassia glumaceoides, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a sweet fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Brassia glumaceoides is a popular choice for collectors due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
