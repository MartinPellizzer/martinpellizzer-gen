    "intro": "Bignonia robusta, commonly known as the crossvine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. These flowers bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia robusta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types once established."
