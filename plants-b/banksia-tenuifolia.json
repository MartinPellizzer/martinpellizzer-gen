    "intro": "Banksia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, needle-like leaves and its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Banksia tenuifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
