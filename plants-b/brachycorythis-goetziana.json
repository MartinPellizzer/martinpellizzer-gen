    "intro": "Brachycorythis goetziana, commonly known as the Goetz's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Brazil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
