    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum f. confusum, commonly known as the confused moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often curved fronds that are divided into small, tooth-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
