It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact, rounded canopy and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, and the tree is relatively slow-growing with a long lifespan. Boerlagiodendron diversifolium is well-suited to coastal and sheltered garden environments."
