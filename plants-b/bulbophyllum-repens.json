    "intro": "Bulbophyllum repens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged along the rhizomes, contributing to its low-growing appearance. Bulbophyllum repens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
