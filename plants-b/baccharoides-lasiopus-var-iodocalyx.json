    "intro": "Baccharoides lasiopus var. iodocalyx, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and maritime hammocks. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration. The varietal name *iodocalyx* refers to the iodine-like scent of its foliage and the calyx surrounding its flowers."
