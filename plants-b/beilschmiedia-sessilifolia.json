    "intro": "Beilschmiedia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf beilschmiedia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with humid climates. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, smooth, dark-colored drupe. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
