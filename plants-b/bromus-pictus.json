    "intro": "Bromus pictus, commonly known as the painted brome, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces dense spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically brown or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Bromus pictus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
