    "intro": "Bruguiera exaristata, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a halophytic tree species native to the Indo-Pacific region. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in coastal areas and mangrove forests. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bruguiera exaristata plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
