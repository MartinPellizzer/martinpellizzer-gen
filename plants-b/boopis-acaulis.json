    "intro": "Boopis acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which aids in reducing water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late summer, adding color to the rocky landscapes where it thrives. Boopis acaulis is adapted to cold, dry conditions and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
