    "intro": "Baccharis crispa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Baccharis crispa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
