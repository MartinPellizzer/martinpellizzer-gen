    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bittercress, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its hairy, wrinkled leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. It typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, along pathways, and in cultivated fields. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in various agricultural and horticultural settings. The species is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America."
