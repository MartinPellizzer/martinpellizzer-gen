    "intro": "Brunfelsia americana var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet plant or purple shower tree, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small bells. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in gardens and as a houseplant."
