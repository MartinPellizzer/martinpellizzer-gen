    "intro": "Boronia triphylla, commonly known as the Three-leaved Boronia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Boronia triphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
