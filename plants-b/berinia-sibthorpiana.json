    "intro": "Berinia sibthorpiana, commonly known as the Kashmiri snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
