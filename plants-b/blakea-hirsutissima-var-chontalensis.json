    "intro": "Blakea hirsutissima var. chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal hill balsa, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and fibrous roots make it a unique specimen in botanical studies, particularly for its ecological adaptations. The variety is distinguished by its dense pubescence and specific habitat preferences in humid, lowland forests."
