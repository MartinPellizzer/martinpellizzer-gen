    "intro": "Betonica officinalis f. laxata, commonly known as the lax leaf betonica, is a variant of the greater betony, native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Its leaves are used in herbal medicine for their purported calming and digestive properties. The f. laxata form is distinguished by its more loosely arranged leaves compared to the typical form."
