    "intro": "Bobrovia polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fleshy and adapted for storing water, which is essential for survival in its harsh habitat. Bobrovia polyphylla is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
