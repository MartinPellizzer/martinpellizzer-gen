    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rubromaculatum, commonly known as the red-spotted orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers with red and yellow markings on the petals and sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
