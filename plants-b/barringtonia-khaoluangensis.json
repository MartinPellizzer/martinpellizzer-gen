It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and sprawling canopy. The plant produces distinctive white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ecological role and has limited distribution in its native habitat."
