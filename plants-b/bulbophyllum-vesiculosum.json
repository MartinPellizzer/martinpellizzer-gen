    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vesiculosum, commonly known as the bubble orchid, is a fascinating epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss. Bulbophyllum vesiculosum is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
