It features slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
