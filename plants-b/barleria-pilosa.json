    "intro": "Barleria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy barleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Barleria pilosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun."
