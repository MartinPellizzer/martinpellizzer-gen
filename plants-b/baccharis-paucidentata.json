    "intro": "Baccharis paucidentata, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It has a woody stem and produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Baccharis paucidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
