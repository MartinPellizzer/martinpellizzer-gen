    "intro": "Bidens coreocarpoides, commonly known as the coreocarpoid tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its seed capsules split open to release seeds with tiny barbs that adhere to animals, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant's hairy stems and leaves are characteristic features that help identify it in its natural habitat."
