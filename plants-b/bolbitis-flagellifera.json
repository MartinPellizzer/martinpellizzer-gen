    "intro": "Bolbitis flagellifera, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, shield-shaped leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives the plant a soft, ornamental look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
