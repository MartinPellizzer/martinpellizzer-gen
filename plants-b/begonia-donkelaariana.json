    "intro": "Begonia donkelaariana, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that have a unique, waxy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
