    "intro": "Bignonia haemantha, commonly known as the scarlet trumpet vine, is a striking climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or trellises. Bignonia haemantha thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
