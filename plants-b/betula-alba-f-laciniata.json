This ornamental tree is native to northern Europe and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin, giving it a unique appearance compared to the standard white birch. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and pale, often with a white or silver hue. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
