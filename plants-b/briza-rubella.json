    "intro": "Briza rubella, commonly known as red false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a fine, silky texture. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-red flower spikes in late spring to early summer, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
