    "intro": "Bromus macranthos var. minor, commonly known as the lesser brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
