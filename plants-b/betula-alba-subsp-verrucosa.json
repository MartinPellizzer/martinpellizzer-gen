    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the European white birch, is a variant of the white birch species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that develops fissures with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with slender, spreading branches. The leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn."
