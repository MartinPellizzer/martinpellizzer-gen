    "intro": "Brachystelma pygmaeum subsp. flavidum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered stone orchid, is a small, perennial succulent native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a short, branching stem with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and borne in clusters, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and attractive floral display."
