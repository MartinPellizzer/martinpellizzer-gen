    "intro": "Bermudiana sellowiana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
