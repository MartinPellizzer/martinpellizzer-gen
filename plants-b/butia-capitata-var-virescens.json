    "intro": "Butia capitata var. virescens, commonly known as the green-pod date palm, is a variant of the native Brazilian butia palm. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and long, pinnate leaves that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, green pods that mature into edible dates, though they are less commonly cultivated for this purpose. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
