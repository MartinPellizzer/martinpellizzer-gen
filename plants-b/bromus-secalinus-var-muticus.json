    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. muticus, commonly known as the muticous brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. It is characterized by its reduced flowering structures, which contribute to its common name \"muticous,\" meaning mute or voiceless."
