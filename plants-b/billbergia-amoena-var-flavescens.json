    "intro": "Billbergia amoena var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette, with the inner leaves often displaying a yellowish or golden hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
