    "intro": "Begonia lignosa, commonly known as the woody begonia, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in the summer months. Begonia lignosa thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce new shoots from the base, allowing for easy propagation."
