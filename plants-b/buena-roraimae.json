    "intro": "Buena roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sedge, is a perennial herb native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to the high humidity and nutrient-poor soils of the region. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its unique ecological niche, Buena roraimae plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
