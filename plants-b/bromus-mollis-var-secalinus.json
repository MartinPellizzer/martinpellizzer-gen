    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. secalinus, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and bright yellow to orange inflorescences that appear in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas. The variety secalinus is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Bromus mollis."
