    "intro": "Borzicactus eriotrichus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to white hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a low, rounded shrub with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
