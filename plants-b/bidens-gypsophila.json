    "intro": "Bidens gypsophila, commonly known as the desert tickseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with white markings. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Bidens gypsophila is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
