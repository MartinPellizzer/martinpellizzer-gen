    "intro": "Besleria rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the wrinkled-leaf begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
