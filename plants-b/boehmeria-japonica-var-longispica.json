    "intro": "Boehmeria japonica var. longispica, commonly known as Japanese false flax, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the nettle family (Urticaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for making textiles and paper, highlighting its ecological and cultural significance."
