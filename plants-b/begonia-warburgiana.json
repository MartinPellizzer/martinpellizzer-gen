    "intro": "Begonia warburgiana, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and contrasting veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
