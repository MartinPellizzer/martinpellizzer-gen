    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hymenobracteum var. giriwoense, commonly known as the Giriwoen orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features strikingly colorful, butterfly-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss. This orchid is highly sought after by horticulturists for its unique floral display and rarity in cultivation."
