    "intro": "Breonia citrifolia, commonly known as the citron tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by the development of citrus-like fruits. These fruits are generally small, round, and have a yellowish-orange skin with a distinct, sour aroma. Breonia citrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the unique flavor of its fruit, which is used in local cuisines and traditional remedies."
