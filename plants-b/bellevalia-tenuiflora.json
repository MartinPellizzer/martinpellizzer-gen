It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate blue or violet flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, and it is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.
