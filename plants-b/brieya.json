    "intro": "Brieya, commonly known as the \"briery\" or \"briey,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Brieya species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America. They produce small, fleshy fruits that are sometimes edible, though many species are used in traditional medicine. The genus is notable for its ecological role in supporting various pollinators and wildlife."
