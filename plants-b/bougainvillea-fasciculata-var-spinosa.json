    "intro": "Bougainvillea fasciculata var. spinosa, commonly known as the thorned bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant produces small, white flowers inside the colorful bracts, which are often the main attraction. Its stems are covered in sharp spines, giving it a distinctive and somewhat defensive appearance. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes due to its striking visual appeal."
