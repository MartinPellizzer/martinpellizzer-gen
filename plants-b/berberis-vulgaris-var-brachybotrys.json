It features thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and seasonal color changes. The berries contain toxic compounds and should not be consumed by humans or livestock."
