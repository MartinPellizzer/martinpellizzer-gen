    "intro": "Betula papyrifera subsp. kenaica, commonly known as the Kenaica birch, is a subspecies native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, a feature that distinguishes it from other birch species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The subspecies produces small, catkin-like flowers and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in its native habitat."
