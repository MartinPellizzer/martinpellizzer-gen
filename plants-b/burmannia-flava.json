    "intro": "Burmannia flava, commonly known as the yellow burmannia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often clustered in umbels and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Burmannia flava is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
