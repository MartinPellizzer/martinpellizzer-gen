    "intro": "Bocconia pearcei, commonly known as the pink bocconia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often hidden beneath the showy bracts. Bocconia pearcei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
