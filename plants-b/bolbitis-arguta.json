    "intro": "Bolbitis arguta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
