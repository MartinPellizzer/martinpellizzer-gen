    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. habereri, commonly known as the Habereri moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, two-part frond that resembles a crescent moon, with a central vein and lateral lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is found in parts of North America and Eurasia. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the frond, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive morphology and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
