    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
