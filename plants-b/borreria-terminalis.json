    "intro": "Borreria terminalis, commonly known as the Mexican heath or desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and shrub-like growth habit. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are small, opposite, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Borreria terminalis is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
