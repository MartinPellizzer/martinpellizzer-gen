    "intro": "Banksia cynaroides, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense, cone-like structure. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs. Banksia cynaroides is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
