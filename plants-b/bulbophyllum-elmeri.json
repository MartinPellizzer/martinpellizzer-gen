    "intro": "Bulbophyllum elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. It is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
