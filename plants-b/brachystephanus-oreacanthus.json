    "intro": "Brachystephanus oreacanthus, commonly known as the mountain stephanus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its small, showy flowers are often arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
