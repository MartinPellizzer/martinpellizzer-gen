    "intro": "Balanites rotundifolia, commonly known as the African sand apple, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, round, yellowish fruits that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant has small, palmate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are often clustered in groups. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. The fruit is edible when ripe and has a sweet, tangy flavor, making it a valuable resource in local communities."
