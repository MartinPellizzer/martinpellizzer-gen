It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, making it ideal for hanging baskets or ground cover. Its foliage is often variegated, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
