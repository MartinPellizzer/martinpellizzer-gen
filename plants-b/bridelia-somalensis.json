    "intro": "Bridelia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali bridelia, is a shrub native to the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with latex-producing properties. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in arid environments."
