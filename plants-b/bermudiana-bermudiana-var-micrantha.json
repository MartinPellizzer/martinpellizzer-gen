    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered Bermuda grass, is a variant of the Bermuda grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it is highly drought-tolerant once established. This variety is also known for its ability to spread through both rhizomes and stolons, forming a thick, resilient turf."
