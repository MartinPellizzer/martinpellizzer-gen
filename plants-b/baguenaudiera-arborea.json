    "intro": "Baguenaudiera arborea, commonly known as the tree baguenaudiera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Baguenaudiera arborea is often found in moist, shaded forest environments where it thrives in the understory."
