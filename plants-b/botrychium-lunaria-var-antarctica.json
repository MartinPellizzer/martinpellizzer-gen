    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine or subantarctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
