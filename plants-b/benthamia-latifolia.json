    "intro": "Benthamia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf benthamia, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Benthamia latifolia produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
