    "intro": "Begonia semiovata, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its pendulous, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, moist environments with indirect light. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, while the flowers range from pink to red, adding a vibrant splash of color. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or containers due to its cascading growth habit. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
