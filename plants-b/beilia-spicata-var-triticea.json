    "intro": "Beilia spicata var. triticea, commonly known as the wheatgrass variant, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes used in herbal remedies and livestock feed."
