    "intro": "Bromus morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's brome, is a flowering plant species native to South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awn-tipped lemmas. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus morrisonensis is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
