    "intro": "Balthasaria schliebenii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth balthasaria, is a rare plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
