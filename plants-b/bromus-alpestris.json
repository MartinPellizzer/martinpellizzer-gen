    "intro": "Bromus alpestris, commonly known as alpine brome, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy seeds. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with limited soil nutrients and strong winds. Bromus alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
