    "intro": "Buddleja amentacea, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping panicles of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja amentacea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
