    "intro": "Blechnum fendleri var. ternatum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a variety of the genus Blechnum native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or wetland areas. The leaves are usually light green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value."
