    "intro": "Bogoria, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in areas with high humidity and low light. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor bog soils. Bogoria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
