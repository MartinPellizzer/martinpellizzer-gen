    "intro": "Bulbophyllum levatii subsp. mischanthum, commonly known as the Yellow Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its humid, shaded forest habitats. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming briefly before withering, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
