    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. flaccidus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its reduced stature and flaccid appearance, distinguishing it from other bromus species."
