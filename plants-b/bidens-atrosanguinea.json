It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of darker, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges and a rough texture. Bidens atrosanguinea is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a potential indicator of wetland health."
