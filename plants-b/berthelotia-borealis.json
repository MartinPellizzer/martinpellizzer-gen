    "intro": "Berthelotia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a small herbaceous plant with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Berthelotia borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local pollinators."
