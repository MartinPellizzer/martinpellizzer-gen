    "intro": "Batidophaca nebraskensis, commonly known as the Nebraska batidophaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the tallgrass prairies of Nebraska. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation programs."
