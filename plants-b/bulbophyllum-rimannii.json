It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
