    "intro": "Briza triloba f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf quaking grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It features slender, arching stems with small, feathery inflorescences that sway in the breeze, giving it a delicate appearance. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive texture. This variety is a compact form of the species, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
