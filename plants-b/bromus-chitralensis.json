    "intro": "Bromus chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. Bromus chitralensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
