It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a central disk. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Brachanthemum fruticulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
