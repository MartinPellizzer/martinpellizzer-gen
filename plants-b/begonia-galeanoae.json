    "intro": "Begonia galeanoae, commonly known as the Galeano's begonia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and clusters of vibrant red and orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Begonia galeanoae is considered a conservation concern."
