    "intro": "Bidens hawaiensis, commonly known as Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with distinctive white markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Bidens hawaiensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is an important part of the native flora of Hawaii."
