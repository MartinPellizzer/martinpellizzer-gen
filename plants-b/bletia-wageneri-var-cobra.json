    "intro": "Bletia wageneri var. cobra, commonly known as the Cobra Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful flowers that resemble a cobra's hood, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, shaded environments it prefers. The orchid produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
