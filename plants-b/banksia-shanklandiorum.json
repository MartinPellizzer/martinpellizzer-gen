    "intro": "Banksia shanklandiorum, commonly known as the red banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flower spikes, which appear in late summer and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Banksia shanklandiorum is an important component of the local ecosystem and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
