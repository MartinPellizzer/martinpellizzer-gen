It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used in traditional medicine. Baccharis cuneata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
