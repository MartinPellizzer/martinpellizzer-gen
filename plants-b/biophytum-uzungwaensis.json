    "intro": "Biophytum uzungwaensis, commonly known as the Uzungwa sunplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Phyllanthaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming dense clusters with a rosette-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
