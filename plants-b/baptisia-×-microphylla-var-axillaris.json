    "intro": "Baptisia \u00d7 microphylla var. axillaris, commonly known as the dwarf false indigo, is a compact, deciduous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking blue to purple flower spikes that appear in early summer, adding a bold color contrast to gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This variety is smaller than the typical Baptisia \u00d7 microphylla, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces or rock gardens."
