    "intro": "Bupleurum longicaule var. amplexicaule, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper part. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and sometimes clasping the stem, giving it its varietal name \"amplexicaule.\" Its flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
