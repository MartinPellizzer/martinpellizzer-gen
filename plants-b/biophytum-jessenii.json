    "intro": "Biophytum jessenii, commonly known as the Jessen's ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Biophytum jessenii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
