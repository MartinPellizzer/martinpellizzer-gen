    "intro": "Blechnum integrifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often glossy fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered into sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
