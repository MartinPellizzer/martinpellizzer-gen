    "intro": "Bryonia attenuata, commonly known as wild cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a climbing vine that produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fruit is a spiny, orange-colored capsule that contains seeds. Bryonia attenuata has been used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
