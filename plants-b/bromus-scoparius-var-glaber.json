    "intro": "Bromus scoparius var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairless or very softly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
