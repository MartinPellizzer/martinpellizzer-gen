    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. maximus, commonly known as the Spanish brome, is a grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to reddish-brown, with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
