    "intro": "Brachypterum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly pod sida, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive, inflated seed pods that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. The plant produces small white or pink flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its hairy foliage and persistent pods make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. Brachypterum eriocarpum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
