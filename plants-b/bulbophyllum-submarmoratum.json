It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often variegated foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
