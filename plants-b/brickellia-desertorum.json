    "intro": "Brickellia desertorum, commonly known as desert brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features a low, sprawling growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its flowers are tubular and clustered in dense heads, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brickellia desertorum is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought-prone areas."
