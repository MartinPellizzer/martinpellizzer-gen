    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. ramosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The species is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
