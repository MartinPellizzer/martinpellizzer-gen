    "intro": "Bolboschoenus compactus, commonly known as the compact bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or green flowers in the summer. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Bolboschoenus compactus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
