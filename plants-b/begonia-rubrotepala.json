    "intro": "Begonia rubrotepala, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
