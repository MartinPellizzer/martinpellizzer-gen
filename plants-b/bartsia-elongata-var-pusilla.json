It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-orange flowers in early summer, which are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often overlooked member of the Orobanchaceae family."
