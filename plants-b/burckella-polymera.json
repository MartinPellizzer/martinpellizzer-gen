    "intro": "Burckella polymera, commonly known as the clustered burckella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Burckella polymera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
