    "intro": "Byrsopteris hasseltii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a sturdy, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
