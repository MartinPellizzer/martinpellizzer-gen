    "intro": "Braya purpurascens f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh alpine conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
