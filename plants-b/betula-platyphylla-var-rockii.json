    "intro": "Betula platyphylla var. rockii, commonly known as the Korean birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
