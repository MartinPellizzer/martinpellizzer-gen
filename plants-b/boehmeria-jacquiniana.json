It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the fibers derived from its leaves."
