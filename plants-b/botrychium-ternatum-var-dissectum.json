    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf division compared to the typical form of Botrychium ternatum."
