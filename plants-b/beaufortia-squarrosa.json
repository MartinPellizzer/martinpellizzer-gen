    "intro": "Beaufortia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa beaufortia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the autumn season. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Beaufortia squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
