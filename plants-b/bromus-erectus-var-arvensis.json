    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. arvensis, commonly known as the field brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
