    "intro": "Buxus sinica var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into intricate topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a foundation plant in formal landscapes."
