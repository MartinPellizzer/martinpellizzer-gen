    "intro": "Boerhavia scabrida, commonly known as sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, hairy stems, and small, pink or white flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a scabrous texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Boerhavia scabrida is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
