It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
