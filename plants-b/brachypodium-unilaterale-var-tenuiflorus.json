    "intro": "Brachypodium unilaterale var. tenuiflorus, commonly known as slender-flowered false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually borne on one side of the stem, giving it its specific epithet \"unilaterale.\" The flowers are small and clustered, with slender florets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
