    "intro": "Bulbophyllum caecum, commonly known as the blind orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often white or pale-colored flowers that resemble small, bulb-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted for water storage in its natural habitat. The orchid's name \"caecum\" refers to its seemingly blind or inconspicuous appearance, which helps it blend into its surroundings."
