    "intro": "Bahel schulli, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy white or pink flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and waxy leaf coatings. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive during brief periods of rainfall. Bahel schulli plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
