    "intro": "Bahia trifida, commonly known as Florida panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in warm climates. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
