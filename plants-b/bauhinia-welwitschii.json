    "intro": "Bauhinia welwitschii, commonly known as the velvetwood, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, bean-like pods and its striking, palmate leaves that resemble hands. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Bauhinia welwitschii is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
