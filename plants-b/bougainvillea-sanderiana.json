    "intro": "Bougainvillea sanderiana, commonly known as the pink princess bougainvillea, is a vibrant flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its clusters of papery, pink bracts that surround small, white flowers. The plant is a vigorous grower, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet when cultivated in suitable conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the warmer seasons."
