    "intro": "Bulbophyllum physometrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate, intricate structures that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
