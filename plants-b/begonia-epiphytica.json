    "intro": "Begonia epiphytica, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a rare and unusual member of the Begoniaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants rather than in soil. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red and pink. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums to mimic its natural conditions."
