    "intro": "Buxus fruticosa, commonly known as common boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It has small, oval, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is widely cultivated as a hedge or topiary due to its slow growth and ability to be shaped. Buxus fruticosa prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile ornamental plant."
