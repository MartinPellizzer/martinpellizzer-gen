    "intro": "Bromus ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often produce panicles of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Bromus ambigens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
