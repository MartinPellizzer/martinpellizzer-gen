    "intro": "Bolboschoenus paludosus var. umbellatus, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters in marshy or boggy environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies in wet soils. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
