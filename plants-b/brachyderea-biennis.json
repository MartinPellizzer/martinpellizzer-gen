    "intro": "Brachyderea biennis, commonly known as the short-lived daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Due to its short lifespan, it often reseeds itself to ensure the continuation of its population."
