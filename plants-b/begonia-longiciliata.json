    "intro": "Begonia longiciliata, commonly known as the long-hair begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves with prominent, long, white hairs along the veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
