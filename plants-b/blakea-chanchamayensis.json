    "intro": "Blakea chanchamayensis, commonly known as the Chanchamayo Blakea, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded environments of the Andean cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
