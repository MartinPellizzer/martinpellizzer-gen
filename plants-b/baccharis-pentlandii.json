    "intro": "Baccharis pentlandii, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Baccharis pentlandii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
