    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but now invasive in many parts of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-green to brownish flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in disturbed soils, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its invasive success in arid and semi-arid environments. The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can tolerate drought conditions."
