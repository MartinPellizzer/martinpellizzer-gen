    "intro": "Betula humilis f. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical birch, is a variant of the dwarf birch. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, multi-branched form. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pale green underside. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This plant is typically found in moist, acidic soils in northern regions, often growing in open habitats such as heaths and forest edges."
