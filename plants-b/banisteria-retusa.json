    "intro": "Banisteria retusa, commonly known as the red-veined or red-leafed begonia, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant red veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Banisteria retusa is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in hanging baskets or as a climbing plant."
