    "intro": "Bidens glabrata, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small yellow flowers with five petals. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by attachment to animals or clothing, a trait that contributes to its widespread distribution. Bidens glabrata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
