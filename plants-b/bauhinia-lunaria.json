    "intro": "Bauhinia lunaria, commonly known as the moonflower bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves that resemble parchment, and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces flat, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia lunaria thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique blooming pattern and aesthetic appeal make it a notable species in botanical collections."
