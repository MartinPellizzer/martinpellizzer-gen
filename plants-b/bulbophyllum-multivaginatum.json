    "intro": "Bulbophyllum multivaginatum, commonly known as the multi-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
