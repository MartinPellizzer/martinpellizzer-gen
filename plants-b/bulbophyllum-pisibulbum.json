    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pisibulbum, commonly known as the Pisos Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but is not widely available in the horticultural trade."
