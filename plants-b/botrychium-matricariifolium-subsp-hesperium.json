    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium subsp. hesperium, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with rosettes of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, resembling that of the common moonwort but with subtle differences in size and shape."
