    "intro": "Bauhinia tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pod-like seed capsules that resemble small burrs, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small, delicate leaflets. Bauhinia tenuiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
