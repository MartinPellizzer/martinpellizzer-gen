    "intro": "Bellinia contorta, commonly known as the bent-leaved bellionia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, often hairy leaves that curl or twist, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically pale yellow or greenish, appearing in clusters. Bellinia contorta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
