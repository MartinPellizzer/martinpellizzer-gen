    "intro": "Bulbophyllum paniculatum, commonly known as the orchid with the clustered flowers, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are adapted for aerial attachment to trees and can absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
