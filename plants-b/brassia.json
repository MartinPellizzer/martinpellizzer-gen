    "intro": "Brassia, commonly known as the orchid or ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Brassia species are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. They require bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts. Their unique appearance and delicate beauty make them a prized addition to greenhouses and botanical gardens."
