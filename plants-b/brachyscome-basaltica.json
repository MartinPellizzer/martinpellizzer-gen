    "intro": "Brachyscome basaltica, commonly known as the basalt daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils, particularly in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Brachyscome basaltica is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value."
