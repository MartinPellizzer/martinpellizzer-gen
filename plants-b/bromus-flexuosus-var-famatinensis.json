    "intro": "Bromus flexuosus var. famatinensis, commonly known as the Famatinian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale to brownish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
