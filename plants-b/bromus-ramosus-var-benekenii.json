    "intro": "Bromus ramosus var. benekenii, commonly known as the Beneken's brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, with lemmas that are often hairy. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is adapted to temperate climates with moderate rainfall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
