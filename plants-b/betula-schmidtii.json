    "intro": "Betula schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, thriving in cooler, high-altitude environments. This species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
