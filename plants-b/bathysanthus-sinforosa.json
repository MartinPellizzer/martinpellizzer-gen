    "intro": "Bathysanthus sinforosa, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-brown stems and its striking, bright red flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its flowers are typically small, with three petals and three sepals, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
