    "intro": "Bohadschia humifusa, commonly known as the flatback sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its distinctive, flattened body and lack of a shell. The plant, or more accurately, the animal, has a soft, gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus. It feeds primarily on algae and is often found in shallow coastal waters. Bohadschia humifusa plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the breakdown of algae and serving as prey for various marine predators."
