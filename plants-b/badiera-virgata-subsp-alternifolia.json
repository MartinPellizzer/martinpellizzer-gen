    "intro": "Badiera virgata subsp. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf badiera, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
