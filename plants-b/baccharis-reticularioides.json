    "intro": "Baccharis reticularioides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking contrast to its green stems and flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, textured surface, which aids in reducing water loss in arid conditions. Baccharis reticularioides is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common species in coastal and sandy habitats."
