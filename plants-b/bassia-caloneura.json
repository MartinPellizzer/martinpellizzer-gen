    "intro": "Bassia caloneura, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Bassia caloneura is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
