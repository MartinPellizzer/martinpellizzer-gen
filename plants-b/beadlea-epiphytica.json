    "intro": "Beadlea epiphytica, commonly known as the slender epiphytic orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
