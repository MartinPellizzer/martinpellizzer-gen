    "intro": "Bellevalia pseudomuscari, commonly known as the false muscat grape, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb and are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and can remain dormant for extended periods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
