It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, thriving in areas with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.
