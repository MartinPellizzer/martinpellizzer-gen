It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that is highly ornamental and often used in topiary. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, red berries. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain shape make it a popular choice for formal landscaping."
