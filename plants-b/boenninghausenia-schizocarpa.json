    "intro": "Boenninghausenia schizocarpa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Boenninghausenia schizocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
