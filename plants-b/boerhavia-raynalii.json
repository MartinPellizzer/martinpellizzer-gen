    "intro": "Boerhavia raynalii, commonly known as the Redroot Sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Boerhavia raynalii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
