    "intro": "Blechnum auriculatum var. parvulum, commonly known as the small-ear fern, is a compact fern species native to New Zealand. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
