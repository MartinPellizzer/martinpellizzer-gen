    "intro": "Ballota hirsuta subsp. inermis, commonly known as the hairy ballota, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its subspecies inermis is distinguished by the absence of the bristly hairs found in the main species, giving it a smoother appearance. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
