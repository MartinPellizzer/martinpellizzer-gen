    "intro": "Botrychium strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds. Botrychium strictum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It is a relatively rare species, with limited geographic distribution across North America."
