It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Briquetina incarum is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
