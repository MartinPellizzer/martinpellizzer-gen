    "intro": "Begonia populnea var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long, slender petioles. The foliage is typically a vibrant green, often with a velvety texture and a waxy coating. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in summer. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
