    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, often forked sporophyll that bears the spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lanceolate, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other moonworts. This variant is relatively rare and is often found in specific regions of North America."
