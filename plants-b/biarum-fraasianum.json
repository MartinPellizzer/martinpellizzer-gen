    "intro": "Biarum fraasianum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Biarum fraasianum is known for its unique appearance and is considered one of the most elusive orchids in the wild. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, it is listed as endangered in several states."
