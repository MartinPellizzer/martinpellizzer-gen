    "intro": "Begonia xanthina var. reichenheimii, commonly known as the orange begonia, is a hybrid species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often borne on long, slender stalks. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
