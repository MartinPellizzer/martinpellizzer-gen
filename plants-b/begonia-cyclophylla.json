    "intro": "Begonia cyclophylla, commonly known as the spiral begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia cyclophylla is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its delicate foliage and attractive blooms."
