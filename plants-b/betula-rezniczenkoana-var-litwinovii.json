    "intro": "Betula rezniczenkoana var. litwinovii, commonly known as the Litwinovii birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that remains throughout its life. The leaves are elliptical, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold, moist environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
