    "intro": "Bruguiera arnottiana, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are small and thick, reducing water loss in high-salinity conditions. Bruguiera arnottiana is also capable of nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in tidal ecosystems."
