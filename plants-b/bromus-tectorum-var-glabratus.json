    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. glabratus, commonly known as cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but now widely invasive in North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and is well adapted to disturbed soils and arid environments. It is an annual in most regions, completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its invasive success and ecological impact."
