    "intro": "Bromus villosus, commonly known as hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing several small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus villosus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
