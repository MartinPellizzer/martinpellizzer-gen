    "intro": "Biserrula pelecinus subsp. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian biserrula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a forage crop due to its high nutritional content."
