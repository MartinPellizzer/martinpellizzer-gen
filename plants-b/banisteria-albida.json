    "intro": "Banisteria albida, commonly known as the white banister, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often fragrant. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Banisteria albida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or partially sunny environments."
