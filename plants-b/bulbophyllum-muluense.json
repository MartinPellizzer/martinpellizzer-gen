    "intro": "Bulbophyllum muluense, commonly known as the Mulu orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum muluense is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
