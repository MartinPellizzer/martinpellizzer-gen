    "intro": "Billbergia farinosa, commonly known as the silver billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia farinosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
