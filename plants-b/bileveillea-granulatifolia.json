    "intro": "Bileveillea granulatifolia, commonly known as the granulate leaf bileveillea, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are covered in small, granular protrusions, giving them a textured appearance. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
