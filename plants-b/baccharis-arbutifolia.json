    "intro": "Baccharis arbutifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used traditionally in some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes. Baccharis arbutifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
