    "intro": "Beilschmiedia congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
