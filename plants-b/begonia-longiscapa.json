    "intro": "Begonia longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
