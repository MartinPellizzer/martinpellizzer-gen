    "intro": "Bulbocodium soboliferum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a bulbous root system that helps it survive in sandy, saline soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often found growing in dunes and along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing the sand."
