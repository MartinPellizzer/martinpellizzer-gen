    "intro": "Bistorta perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bistorta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often in harsh environments where few other plants can survive. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in these extreme conditions. Bistorta perpusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique foliage."
