    "intro": "Berberis multiserrata, commonly known as the many-toothed barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 pairs of serrated leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, red-orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Berberis multiserrata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. It is also known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
