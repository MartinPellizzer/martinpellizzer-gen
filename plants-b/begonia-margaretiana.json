    "intro": "Begonia margaretiana, commonly known as the velvet leaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, depending on the variety. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia margaretiana is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
