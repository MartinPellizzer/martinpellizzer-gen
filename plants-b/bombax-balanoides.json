    "intro": "Bombax balanoides, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth texture. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in full sun and well-drained soils."
