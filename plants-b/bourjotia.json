    "intro": "Bourjotia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, oval leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Bourjotia produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
