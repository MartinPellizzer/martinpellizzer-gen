    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. monandrus, commonly known as the Spanish vetch, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish glumes and lemma-like bracts. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean-type climates."
