    "intro": "Bromus moeszii, commonly known as the Moez's brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with short, narrow lemmas. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Bromus moeszii is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
