    "intro": "Baeckea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baeckea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and woodlands. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Baeckea stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
