    "intro": "Broussaisia arguta f. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved broussaisia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which distinguishes it from other varieties of the species. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
