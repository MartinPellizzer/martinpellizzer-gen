    "intro": "Betula aurea, commonly known as the golden birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its striking yellowish-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Betula aurea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
