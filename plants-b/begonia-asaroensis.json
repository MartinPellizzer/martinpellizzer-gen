    "intro": "Begonia asaroensis, commonly known as the Asaro begonia, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanists."
