    "intro": "Brickellia secundiflora, commonly known as Mexican brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Brickellia secundiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
