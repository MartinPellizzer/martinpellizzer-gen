It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its prostrate stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
