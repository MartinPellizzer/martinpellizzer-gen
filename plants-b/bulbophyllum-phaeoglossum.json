    "intro": "Bulbophyllum phaeoglossum, commonly known as the purple-tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, violet-colored flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, tongue-shaped lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
