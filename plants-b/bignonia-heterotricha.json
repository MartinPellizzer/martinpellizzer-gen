    "intro": "Bignonia heterotricha, commonly known as the creeping trumpetbush, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. Bignonia heterotricha is often found in moist, shady habitats such as along stream banks and in forest understories."
