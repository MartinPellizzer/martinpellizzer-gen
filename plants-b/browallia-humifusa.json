It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has a sprawling habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact size and vibrant blooms, it is often used in floral arrangements and as a bedding plant."
