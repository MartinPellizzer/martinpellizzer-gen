    "intro": "Bassia biflora var. villosa, commonly known as hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its adaptability to drought and heat makes it a resilient species in harsh environments."
