    "intro": "Betela mastica, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers that develop into woody, oblong fruits containing the edible betel nut. The leaves are widely used in traditional practices, while the nuts are processed into a stimulant used in social and cultural contexts. Its botanical significance lies in its role in both local economies and traditional medicine."
