    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
