    "intro": "Bulbophyllum goebelianum, commonly known as the Goebelian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, usually in shades of yellow and green. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less favorable conditions. Bulbophyllum goebelianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
