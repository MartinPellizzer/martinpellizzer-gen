It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Baccharis dentosa is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
