    "intro": "Buchnera ciliata, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops if left uncontrolled."
