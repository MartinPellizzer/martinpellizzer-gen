    "intro": "Banksia marginata var. diffusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in winter and spring. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody fruiting structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
