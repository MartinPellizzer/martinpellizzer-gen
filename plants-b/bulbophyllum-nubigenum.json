    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its role within cloud forest ecosystems and its ornamental value in horticulture."
