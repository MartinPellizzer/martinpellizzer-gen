    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. tectorum, commonly known as the common brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
