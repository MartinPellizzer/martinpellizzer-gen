    "intro": "Behuria lumiarensis, commonly known as the luminary bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Lumiara Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, herbaceous structure with waxy, broad leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its blooming season occurs during the short summer months, when temperatures rise and daylight hours increase. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Behuria lumiarensis is considered an endangered species."
