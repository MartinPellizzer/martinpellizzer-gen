    "intro": "Benthamia herminioides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Benthamia herminioides is often found in rocky areas and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
