    "intro": "Bartonia paniculata subsp. iodandra, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
