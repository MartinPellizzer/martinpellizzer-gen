    "intro": "Bonatea cassidea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish wood and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its slow growth and high demand, Bonatea cassidea is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
