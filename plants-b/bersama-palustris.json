    "intro": "Bersama palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive, segmented structure. Bersama palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
