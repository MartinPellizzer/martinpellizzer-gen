    "intro": "Betula elrodiana, commonly known as the Elrod's birch, is a rare and little-studied species of birch native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and smooth, white bark, similar to other birch species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in association with other hardwoods. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Betula elrodiana is considered a vulnerable species."
