    "intro": "Bignonia regnelliana, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread through seeds and root sprouts."
