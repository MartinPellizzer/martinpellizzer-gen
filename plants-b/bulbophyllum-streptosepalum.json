    "intro": "Bulbophyllum streptosepalum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces striking, often brightly colored flowers with a unique zigzag pattern on its petals and sepals. Its bulb-like structures, called pseudobulbs, store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
