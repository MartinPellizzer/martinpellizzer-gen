It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features make it a hardy and ornamental addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
