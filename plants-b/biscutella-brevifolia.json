    "intro": "Biscutella brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of delicate, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Biscutella brevifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
