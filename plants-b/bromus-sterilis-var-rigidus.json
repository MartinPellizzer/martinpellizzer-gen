    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and rigid, glabrous stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife, it is an important component of high-altitude vegetation."
