    "intro": "Bouteloua stricta, commonly known as blue grama, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, blue-gray flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Blue grama is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its low-growing form makes it an excellent choice for erosion control and native landscape restoration."
