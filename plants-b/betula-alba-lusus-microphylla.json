    "intro": "Betula alba lusus microphylla, commonly known as the white birch with dwarf leaves, is a rare variant of the white birch species. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to typical Betula alba. The plant exhibits a slender, upright growth habit with a distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin layers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in northern temperate regions. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
