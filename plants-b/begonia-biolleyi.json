    "intro": "Begonia biolleyi, commonly known as the golden begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of showy, orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
