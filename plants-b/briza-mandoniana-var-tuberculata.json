    "intro": "Briza mandoniana var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the flower heads consist of two rows of bristles that are often curved or twisted. This variety is distinguished by the presence of tubercles, or small bumps, on the surface of its glumes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
