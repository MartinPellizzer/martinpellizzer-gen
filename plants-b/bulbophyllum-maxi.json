    "intro": "Bulbophyllum maxi, commonly known as the giant bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive pattern of markings. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis. Bulbophyllum maxi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation."
