It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in whorls along the stem, blooming from late spring to early summer.
