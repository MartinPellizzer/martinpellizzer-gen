    "intro": "Butia odorata, commonly known as the areca palm, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small, cold-hardy palm that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant features a slender, unbranched trunk with smooth, grayish-brown bark and pinnate leaves that are dark green and feathery. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible, round fruits that are yellow when ripe. Butia odorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for tropical and subtropical climates."
