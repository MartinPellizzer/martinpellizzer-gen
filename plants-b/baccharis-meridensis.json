    "intro": "Baccharis meridensis, commonly known as Mexican baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Baccharis meridensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
