    "intro": "Banksia intermedia, commonly known as the swamp banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, adapting to waterlogged soils. Banksia intermedia plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
