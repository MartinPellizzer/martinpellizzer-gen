It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
