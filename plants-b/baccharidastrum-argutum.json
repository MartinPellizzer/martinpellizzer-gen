It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common species in xerophytic ecosystems."
