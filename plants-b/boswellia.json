    "intro": "Boswellia, commonly known as frankincense, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. These trees are native to dry regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. The sap of Boswellia trees is tapped and solidifies into a resin, which has been used for centuries in religious and medicinal practices. The resin contains boswellic acids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's unique aroma and therapeutic uses have made it a valuable resource in traditional and modern medicine."
