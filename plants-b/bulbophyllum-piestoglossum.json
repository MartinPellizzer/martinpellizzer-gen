    "intro": "Bulbophyllum piestoglossum, commonly known as the \"Lips of the Moon,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, lip-like petals that resemble small mouths, giving it its striking common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
