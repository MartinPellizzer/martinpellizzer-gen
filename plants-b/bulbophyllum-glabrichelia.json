    "intro": "Bulbophyllum glabrichelia, commonly known as the glabrous lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers typically have a unique lip structure, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
