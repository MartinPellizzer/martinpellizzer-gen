    "intro": "Blechnum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and striking plant in its habitat."
