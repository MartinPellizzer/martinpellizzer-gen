    "intro": "Bobartia aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which are particularly striking in the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Bobartia aurantiaca is noted for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
