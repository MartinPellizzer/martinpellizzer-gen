    "intro": "Bougainvillea formosa, commonly known as the pink princess, is a vibrant flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its clusters of papery bracts that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a trailing or shrub-like growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring regular watering during the growing season. Bougainvillea formosa is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add color to gardens and landscapes."
