    "intro": "Boehmeria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a herbaceous plant native to Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fibrous stems are valued for their strong, durable fibers, which have been used traditionally for making textiles and paper. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters."
