    "intro": "Bolbitis helferiana, commonly known as the Helfer's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or shaded areas. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, and it reproduces primarily through spore propagation rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis helferiana is considered a vulnerable species."
