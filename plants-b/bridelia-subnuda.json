    "intro": "Bridelia subnuda, commonly known as the naked bridelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are orange-red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
