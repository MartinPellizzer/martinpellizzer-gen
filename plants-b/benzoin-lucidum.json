    "intro": "Benzoin lucidum, commonly known as the clear benzoin, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the formation of resinous, aromatic gum. This gum, known as benzoin, is harvested from the tree's bark and is used in perfumery, incense, and traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
