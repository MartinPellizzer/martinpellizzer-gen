    "intro": "Bentheca, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads and silver-blue foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it thrives in salty, windy conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, and they bloom from late summer to autumn. Bentheca species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
