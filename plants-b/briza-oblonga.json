    "intro": "Briza oblonga, commonly known as the narrow feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear delicate, thread-like leaves, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for landscaping in water-sensitive areas."
