    "intro": "Berberis hirtellipes, commonly known as the hairy barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features stout, thorny stems covered in short, glandular hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Berberis hirtellipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest."
