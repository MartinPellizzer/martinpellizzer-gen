    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock box or rock buxus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
