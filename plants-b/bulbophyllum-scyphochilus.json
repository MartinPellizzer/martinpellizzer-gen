    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scyphochilus, commonly known as the cup-lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. The plant typically has dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
