    "intro": "Brassicaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock scurvygrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Brassicaria saxatilis is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. It is often found in alpine and coastal regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
