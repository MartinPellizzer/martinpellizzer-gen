    "intro": "Blastus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its swollen, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its specialized bladders float on the water's surface. Blastus cavaleriei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
