    "intro": "Brownleea galpinii var. major, commonly known as the Cape York emu plant, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and showing resilience to drought."
