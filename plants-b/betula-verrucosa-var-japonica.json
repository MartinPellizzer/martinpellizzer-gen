    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval in shape, turning yellow in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
