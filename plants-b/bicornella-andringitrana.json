    "intro": "Bicornella andringitrana, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale pink, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bicornella andringitrana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
