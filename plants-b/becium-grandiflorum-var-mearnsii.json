It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
