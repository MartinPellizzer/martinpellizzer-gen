    "intro": "Bupleurum freitagii, commonly known as the Freitag's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
