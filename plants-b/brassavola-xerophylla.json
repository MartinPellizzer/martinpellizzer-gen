    "intro": "Brassavola xerophylla, commonly known as the Xerophyll Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native dry environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
