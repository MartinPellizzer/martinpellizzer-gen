It typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, displaying a tufted growth habit with stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with a bluish or grayish hue, giving it its common name. Its seeds are small and oval, with a distinctive awn, aiding in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
