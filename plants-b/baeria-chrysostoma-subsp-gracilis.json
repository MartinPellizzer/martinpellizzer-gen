It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish composite flowers. The subspecies is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with sandy or rocky soils. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
