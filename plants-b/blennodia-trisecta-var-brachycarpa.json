    "intro": "Blennodia trisecta var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized bladders used for capturing small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a distinctive trifoliate leaf structure, with each leaf divided into three lobes. Its short, rounded fruits, or capsules, are adapted for dispersal by water currents. This variant is notable for its carnivorous adaptation, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
