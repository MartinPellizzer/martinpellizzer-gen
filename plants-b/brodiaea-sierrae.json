    "intro": "Brodiaea sierrae, commonly known as Sierra brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
