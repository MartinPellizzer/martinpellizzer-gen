    "intro": "Boschniakia handelii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountain forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often pinkish or reddish inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Boschniakia handelii is considered an endangered species."
