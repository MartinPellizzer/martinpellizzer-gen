It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble willow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
