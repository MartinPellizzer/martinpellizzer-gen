    "intro": "Baptisia megacarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces large, elongated seed pods that remain on the plant well into the fall. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. Baptisia megacarpa is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
