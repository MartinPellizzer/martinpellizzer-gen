    "intro": "Buxus madagascarica subsp. tropophila, commonly known as the Madagascar boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat, rounded shape. It is often used in horticulture for topiary and as a foundation plant due to its durability and resistance to pests. The subspecies tropophila is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more vigorous growth compared to other forms of Buxus madagascarica."
