    "intro": "Butneria nana, commonly known as the dwarf butneria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring compact, rounded foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Butneria nana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
