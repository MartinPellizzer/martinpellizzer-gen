    "intro": "Botrychium rugulosum, commonly known as the rough harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It is native to North America and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Botrychium rugulosum is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family, which includes other unique and primitive ferns."
