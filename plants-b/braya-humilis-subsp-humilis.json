It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically has densely packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces small, rounded seed pods. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a characteristic species of sandy and rocky soils."
