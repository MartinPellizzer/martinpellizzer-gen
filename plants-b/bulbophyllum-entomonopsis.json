    "intro": "Bulbophyllum entomonopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
