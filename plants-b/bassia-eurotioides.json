    "intro": "Bassia eurotioides, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
