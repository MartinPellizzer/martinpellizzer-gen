    "intro": "Briza media var. nivea, commonly known as the silver feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce delicate, white plumes resembling feathers, which are particularly striking in the wind. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is fine and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
