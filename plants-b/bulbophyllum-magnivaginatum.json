    "intro": "Bulbophyllum magnivaginatum, commonly known as the large pouch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on its aerial roots for attachment and moisture absorption. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
