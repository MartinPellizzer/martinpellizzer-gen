    "intro": "Bromus picoeuropeanus, commonly known as the European brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus picoeuropeanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
