    "intro": "Botrychium \u00d7 watertonense, commonly known as the Waterton moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the Canadian Rockies. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, spore-producing structures called sorocarps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are arranged in a spiral pattern along the fronds, a feature typical of the Botrychium genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
