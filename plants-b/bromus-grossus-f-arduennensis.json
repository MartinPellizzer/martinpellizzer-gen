    "intro": "Bromus grossus f. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian rough brome, is a variant of the rough brome species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecological communities."
