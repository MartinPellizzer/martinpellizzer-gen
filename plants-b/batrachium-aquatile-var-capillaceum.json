    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile var. capillaceum, commonly known as the water frog plant, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, thread-like fronds that float on the water's surface, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often near the edges of ponds or marshes. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it relies on water currents for spore dispersal. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
