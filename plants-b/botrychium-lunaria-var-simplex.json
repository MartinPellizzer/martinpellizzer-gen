    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. simplex, commonly known as the moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, with the central leaf bearing a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a unique reproductive system where spores are released from the sorus and dispersed by wind. Botrychium lunaria var. simplex is a perennial plant that exhibits a primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient evolutionary lineage."
