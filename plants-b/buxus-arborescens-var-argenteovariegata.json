    "intro": "Buxus arborescens var. argenteovariegata, commonly known as the silver variegated boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with distinctive white or silver variegation patterns on the leaves, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant has a slow growth rate, making it ideal for topiary and formal garden designs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in cooler climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to maintain a neat, rounded shape with minimal pruning."
