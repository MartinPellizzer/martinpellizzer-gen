    "intro": "Brassavola nodosa var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features a short, horizontal rhizome with several erect, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. Its showy, nodding inflorescence consists of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for well-drained, acidic soils."
