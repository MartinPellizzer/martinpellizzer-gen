    "intro": "Billbergia clavata, commonly known as the clustered billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often adorned with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value. Billbergia clavata thrives in bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
