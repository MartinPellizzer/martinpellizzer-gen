    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. suecica, commonly known as Swedish kale, is a biennial plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its thick, dark green leaves that are often curly or crinkled. The plant produces yellow flowers in the second year of growth, which are followed by round, pale green pods containing small, round seeds. It is a hardy species that thrives in cooler climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves and seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassica family, including cabbage and broccoli."
