It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed sites. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which produce tiny seeds. Beckmannia syzigachne plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
