    "intro": "Bourreria calophylla, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
