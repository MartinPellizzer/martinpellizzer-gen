    "intro": "Byttneria palustris, commonly known as swamp buttonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Byttneria palustris plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
