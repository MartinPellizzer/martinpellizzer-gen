    "intro": "Blepharis richardsiae, commonly known as the Richards' blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid regions. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
