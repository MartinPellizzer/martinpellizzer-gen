    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. tripartitum, commonly known as the three-lobed moonwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. This variant is distinguished by its three-parted leaf structure, which sets it apart from other members of the Botrychium genus."
