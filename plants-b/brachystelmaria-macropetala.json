    "intro": "Brachystelmaria macropetala, commonly known as the giant petal orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink petals that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, making it one of the most visually distinctive orchids in the region. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom during the warmer months, usually between September and December, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its natural environment."
