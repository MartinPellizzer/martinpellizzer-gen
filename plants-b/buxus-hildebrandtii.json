    "intro": "Buxus hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often used in formal landscaping and topiary."
