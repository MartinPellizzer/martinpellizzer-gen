    "intro": "Burmeistera ignimontis var. ovalis, commonly known as the Mexican firebush, is a striking plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped, hence the variety name *ovalis*, and are often covered in fine hairs. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
