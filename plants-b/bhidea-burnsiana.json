    "intro": "Bhidea burnsiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Bhidea burnsiana thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
