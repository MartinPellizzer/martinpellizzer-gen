It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and intricate leaf morphology. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforest environments. Its flowers are small and often clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, which attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
