    "intro": "Bahia nudicaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bahia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat in arid environments."
