    "intro": "Blepharis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy blepharis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, pale blue to violet blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Blepharis hirsuta is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun with minimal water."
