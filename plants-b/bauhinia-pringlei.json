    "intro": "Bauhinia pringlei, commonly known as the pink bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a leathery, pod-like fruit that splits open when mature. Bauhinia pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
