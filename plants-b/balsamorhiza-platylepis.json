    "intro": "Balsamorhiza platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved balsamroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, silvery-gray basal leaves and a tall, upright stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by storing water and nutrients. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
