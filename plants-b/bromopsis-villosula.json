    "intro": "Bromopsis villosula, commonly known as the woolly bromus, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Bromopsis villosula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
