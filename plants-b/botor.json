    "intro": "Botor, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white. Botor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
