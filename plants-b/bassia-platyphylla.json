    "intro": "Bassia platyphylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Bassia platyphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
