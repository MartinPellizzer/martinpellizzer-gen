    "intro": "Banksia subpinnatifida var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces striking cylindrical flower spikes, which are usually yellow or orange in color, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nectar-feeding birds, particularly the honeyeater. The species is known for its ecological importance in providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
