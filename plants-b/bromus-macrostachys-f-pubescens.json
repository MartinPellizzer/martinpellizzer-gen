It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
