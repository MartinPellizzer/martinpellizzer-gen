    "intro": "Bituminaria acaulis, commonly known as the stonecrop or rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Bituminaria acaulis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
