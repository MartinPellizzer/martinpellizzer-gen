    "intro": "Blechnum pectinatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a silvery, scaly appearance on the underside. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically divided into small, overlapping segments that give it a unique, feathery look. Blechnum pectinatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also culturally significant to the M\u0101ori people."
