    "intro": "Briza neesii var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and delicate, feather-like inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
