    "intro": "Bicornella globosa, commonly known as the globe coralroot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, globular cluster, giving it its common name. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which supply it with carbohydrates. Bicornella globosa is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as pine woodlands and wetlands."
