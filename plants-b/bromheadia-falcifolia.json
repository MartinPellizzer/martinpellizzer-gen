It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
