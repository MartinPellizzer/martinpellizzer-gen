    "intro": "Bahia biternata, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
