    "intro": "Betula americana, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of light brown beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges. Betula americana typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
