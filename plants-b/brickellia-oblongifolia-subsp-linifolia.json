    "intro": "Brickellia oblongifolia subsp. linifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brickellia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
