    "intro": "Brassica insularis, commonly known as the Mediterranean cabbage, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically green or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a traditional vegetable in some Mediterranean cuisines. Brassica insularis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
