    "intro": "Blechnum neohollandicum, commonly known as the New Holland holly fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
