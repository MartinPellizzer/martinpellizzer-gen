    "intro": "Bigelovia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. They produce yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Bigelovia species are often used in traditional medicine and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
