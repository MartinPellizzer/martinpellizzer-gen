    "intro": "Benthamia hispida, commonly known as the rough benthamia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Benthamia hispida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
