    "intro": "Bobea sericantha f. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved bobea, is a rare variant of the bobea species native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
