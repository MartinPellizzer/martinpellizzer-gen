    "intro": "Bombax insigne var. alba, commonly known as the white silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a smooth surface. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils."
