    "intro": "Bicuspidaria, commonly known as the two-toothed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed bracts at the base of its inflorescence. The plant typically has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. Bicuspidaria species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
