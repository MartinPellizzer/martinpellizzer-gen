    "intro": "Buccella, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of a single species, Buccella frutescens, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Buccella is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions."
