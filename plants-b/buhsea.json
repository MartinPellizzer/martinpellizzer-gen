    "intro": "Buhsea, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Buhsea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
