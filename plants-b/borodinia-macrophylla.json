    "intro": "Borodinia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are typically white or pink and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Borodinia macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
