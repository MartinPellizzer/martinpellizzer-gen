    "intro": "Bromus purgans var. laeviglumis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with thin, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loose spike of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. The smooth-leaved brome is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
