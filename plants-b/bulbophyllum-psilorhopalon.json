    "intro": "Bulbophyllum psilorhopalon, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a unique, spurred shape. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
