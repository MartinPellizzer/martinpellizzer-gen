    "intro": "Batrachium marinum f. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in moist, acidic soils, typically in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. This variety is a terrestrial form of its aquatic parent species, adapting to land-based environments rather than water. Its growth is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it a sensitive indicator of wetland health. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
