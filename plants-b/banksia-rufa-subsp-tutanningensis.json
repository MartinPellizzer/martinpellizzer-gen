    "intro": "Banksia rufa subsp. tutanningensis, commonly known as the tutanningensis banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences, which are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from underground stems after bushfires."
