    "intro": "Bromus ovatus, commonly known as the oval brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus ovatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
