    "intro": "Batidophaca variegata, commonly known as the variegated batidophaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after ornamental plant in horticulture. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as endangered."
