    "intro": "Blaeria viscosa var. elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon viscous blaeria, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its viscid (sticky) texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, elliptical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
