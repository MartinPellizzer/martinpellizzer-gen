    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate moonwort, is a fern-like fern with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a single, undivided frond that resembles a fern. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with a cluster of sporangia at the base, which is a key feature for identification. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its primitive structure and ecological significance."
