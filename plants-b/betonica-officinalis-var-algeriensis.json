It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. It produces small white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, dark berries. Due to its toxic compounds, it should be handled with care."
