    "intro": "Beta maritima subsp. marcosii, commonly known as the coastal beet or sea beet, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and coastal habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, reddish-purple roots. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or for its edible roots."
