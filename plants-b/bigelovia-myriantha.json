It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
