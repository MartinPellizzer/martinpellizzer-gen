    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp. dumosum, commonly known as the tussock bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit, with dense, tussock-like tufts of leaves that are typically shorter and stiffer than those of the main species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
