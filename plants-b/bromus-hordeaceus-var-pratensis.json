    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
