    "intro": "Boehmeria subintegra, commonly known as Chinese grass or silky boba, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its soft, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature in the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is also valued for its fibrous material, which has been used in textiles and papermaking in some cultures."
