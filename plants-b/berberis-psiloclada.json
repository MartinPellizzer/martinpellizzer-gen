    "intro": "Berberis psiloclada, commonly known as the golden berberis, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of India and Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a mild, somewhat bitter taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
