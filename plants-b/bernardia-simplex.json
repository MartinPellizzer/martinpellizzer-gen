    "intro": "Bernardia simplex, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The plant is typically shrub-like, with trailing stems that can be used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. While it is not related to true sweet potatoes, it shares a similar name due to historical confusion in classification."
