    "intro": "Balanites arabica, commonly known as the desert peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which helps protect them from predation. Balanites arabica is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
