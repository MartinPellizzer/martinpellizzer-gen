It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Bumelia serrulata is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
