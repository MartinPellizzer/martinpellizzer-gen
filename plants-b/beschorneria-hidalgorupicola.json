    "intro": "Beschorneria hidalgorupicola, commonly known as the Hidalgo cycad, is a rare and endangered plant native to the state of Hidalgo in Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae, which includes cycads, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan. Its reproductive structures, including cones, are typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
