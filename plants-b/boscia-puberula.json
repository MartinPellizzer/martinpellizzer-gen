    "intro": "Boscia puberula, commonly known as the rough bosco, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant. Boscia puberula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
