    "intro": "Bromus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and can thrive in poor soils. Bromus lusitanicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
