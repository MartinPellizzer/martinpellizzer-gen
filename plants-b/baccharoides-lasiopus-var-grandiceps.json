    "intro": "Baccharoides lasiopus var. grandiceps, commonly known as the tall sandbar willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it withstand arid and saline conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, typically blooming in early spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and dunes. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and riparian habitats."
