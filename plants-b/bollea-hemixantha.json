    "intro": "Bollea hemixantha, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrients. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its elusive nature. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Bollea hemixantha is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
