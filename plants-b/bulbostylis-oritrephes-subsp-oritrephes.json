    "intro": "Bulbostylis oritrephes subsp. oritrephes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a short, rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting diverse insect and bird life."
