    "intro": "Bupleurum pruinosum, commonly known as the velvet bupleurum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall textured foliage. Bupleurum pruinosum is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
