    "intro": "Brachylaena rhodesiana, commonly known as the Rhodes firethorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
