    "intro": "Brachystegia venosa, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Brachystegia venosa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna ecosystems. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
