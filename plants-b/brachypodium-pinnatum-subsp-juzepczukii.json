It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
