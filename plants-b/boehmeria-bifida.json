It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its slender, fibrous stems and alternate leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive bifid (two-lobed) appearance, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and its fibers are valued for their strength and versatility in traditional uses. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
