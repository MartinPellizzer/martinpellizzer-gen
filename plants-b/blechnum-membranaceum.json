    "intro": "Blechnum membranaceum, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
