It is characterized by its large, sweet, and aromatic fruits with a thin, smooth skin. The plant is a small evergreen tree with dense, thorny branches and dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters. The fruit develops from the flowering period and is typically harvested when fully ripe, offering a unique combination of flavors from its parent species."
