    "intro": "Buxus benguellensis var. benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguella boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage that remains compact and upright throughout the year. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for formal landscaping."
