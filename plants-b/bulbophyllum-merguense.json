    "intro": "Bulbophyllum merguense, commonly known as the Merguense orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses but remains relatively rare in the wild."
