    "intro": "Balbisia miniata var. miniata, commonly known as the miniature balbisia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, requiring moderate watering. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
