    "intro": "Bombax aculeatum, commonly known as the woolly ceiba, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South and Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in yellow or orange hues. The tree has a massive, buttressed trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are compound, with long, slender leaflets, and it produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is also valued for its durable wood and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
