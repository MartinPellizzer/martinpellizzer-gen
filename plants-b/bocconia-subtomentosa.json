It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
