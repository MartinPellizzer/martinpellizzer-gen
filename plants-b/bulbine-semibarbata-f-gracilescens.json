It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
