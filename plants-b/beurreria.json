    "intro": "Beurreria, commonly known as the buttercup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble butter cups, hence its common name. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with a lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis. Beurreria species are often found in moist, temperate regions and can be either herbaceous or shrub-like in form. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others are considered weeds in agricultural settings."
