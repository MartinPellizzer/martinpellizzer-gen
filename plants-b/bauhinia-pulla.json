    "intro": "Bauhinia pulla, commonly known as the velvetwood or purple bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, and often purple-tinged leaves that are divided into small, bean-like segments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bauhinia pulla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
