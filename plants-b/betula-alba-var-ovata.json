    "intro": "Betula alba var. ovata, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring and has slender, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its leaves are triangular with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. The weeping birch is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful, drooping appearance."
