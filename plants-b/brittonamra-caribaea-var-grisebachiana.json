    "intro": "Brittonamra caribaea var. grisebachiana, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and broad, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical moist forests and is valued for its timber. It produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
