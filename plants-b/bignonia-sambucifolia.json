    "intro": "Bignonia sambucifolia, commonly known as the sweet flag or false sweet flag, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that produces clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
