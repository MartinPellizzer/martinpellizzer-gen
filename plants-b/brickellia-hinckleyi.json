    "intro": "Brickellia hinckleyi, commonly known as the Hinckley's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are generally narrow and lance-shaped, with a grayish-green hue that helps reduce water loss. Brickellia hinckleyi is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
