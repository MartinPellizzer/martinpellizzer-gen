    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calamarium var. albociliatum, commonly known as the white-fringed Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and large, showy flowers that often display a combination of white and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The variety albociliatum is distinguished by its white cilia along the leaf margins, which give it its unique appearance."
