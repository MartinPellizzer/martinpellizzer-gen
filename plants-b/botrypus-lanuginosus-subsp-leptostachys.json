    "intro": "Botrypus lanuginosus subsp. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked water fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This subspecies is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability in wetland ecosystems."
