    "intro": "Biscutella collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Biscutella collina is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
