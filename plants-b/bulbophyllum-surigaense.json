    "intro": "Bulbophyllum surigaense, commonly known as the Surigaon Bulbophyllum, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
