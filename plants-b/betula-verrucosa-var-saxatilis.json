    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile birch, is a variant of the European white birch characterized by its distinctive bark and growth habits. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. The bark of this variety is often smoother and lighter in color compared to the typical white birch, with a more rugged texture. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring and has oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones."
