It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
