It is characterized by its stiff, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and grasslands. It produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant, with small, hard seeds. Bromopsis aspera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
