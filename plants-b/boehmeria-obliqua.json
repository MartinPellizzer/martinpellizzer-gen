It is native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The fibers of its stems are also valued for their strength and are used in the production of textiles and paper."
