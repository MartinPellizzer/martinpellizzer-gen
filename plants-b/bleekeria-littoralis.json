    "intro": "Bleekeria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bleekeria littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
