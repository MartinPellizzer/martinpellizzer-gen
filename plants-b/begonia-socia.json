It features attractive, velvety leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and delicate floral display."
