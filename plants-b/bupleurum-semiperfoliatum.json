    "intro": "Bupleurum semiperfoliatum, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Bupleurum semiperfoliatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
