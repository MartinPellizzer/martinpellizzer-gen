It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Boerhavia pulchella is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
