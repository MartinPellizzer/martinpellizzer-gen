    "intro": "Billbergia excellens, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that surround its flowering spikes, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Billbergia excellens is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity."
