    "intro": "Berberis saxatilis, commonly known as the coastal barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, orange, or yellow berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky soils and cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in coastal regions."
