    "intro": "Berberis subantarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic barberry, is a shrub native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in South America and New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in coastal and alpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to harsh climates, contributing to its presence in remote regions."
