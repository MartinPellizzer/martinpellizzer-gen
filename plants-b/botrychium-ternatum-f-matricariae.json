    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum f. matricariae, commonly known as the matricaria fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that are often described as resembling a cluster of small, bell-shaped structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in a distinctive, umbel-like arrangement. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
