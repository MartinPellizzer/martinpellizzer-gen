    "intro": "Bunburia, commonly known as the desert cactus or the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Bunburia typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
