    "intro": "Begonia griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep red or maroon color. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
