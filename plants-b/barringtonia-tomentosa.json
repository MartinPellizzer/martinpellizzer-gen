    "intro": "Barringtonia tomentosa, commonly known as the white cedar or satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, lantern-like flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, particularly at night. The tree has smooth, pale bark and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds attached to silky filaments. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in medicine and woodworking."
