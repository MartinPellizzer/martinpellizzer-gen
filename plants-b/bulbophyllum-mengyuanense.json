    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mengyuanense, commonly known as Mengyuan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its bulbs serve as storage organs, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periodic dry spells. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
