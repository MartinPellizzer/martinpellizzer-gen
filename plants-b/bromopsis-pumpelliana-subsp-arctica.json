    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
