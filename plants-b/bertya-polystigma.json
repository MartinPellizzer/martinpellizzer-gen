    "intro": "Bertya polystigma, commonly known as the broadleaf bertya, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by woolly bracts. Bertya polystigma is typically found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
