    "intro": "Bassia quinquecuspis var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly jointedweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments."
