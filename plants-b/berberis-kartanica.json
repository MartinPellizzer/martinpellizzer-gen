    "intro": "Berberis kartanica, commonly known as the Kartanica barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features thorny stems covered in small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
