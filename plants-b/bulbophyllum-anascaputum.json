    "intro": "Bulbophyllum anascaputum, commonly known as the Cape York orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and a single, slender stem that supports a few elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive greenish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
