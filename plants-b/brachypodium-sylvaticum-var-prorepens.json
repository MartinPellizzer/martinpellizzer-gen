    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological versatility, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
