It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown seeds. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. Bromus pumilio is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
