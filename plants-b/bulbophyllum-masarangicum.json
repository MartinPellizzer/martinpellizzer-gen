    "intro": "Bulbophyllum masarangicum, commonly known as the Borneo ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling ghostly figures. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its natural humid environment. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
