    "intro": "Blandfordia grandiflora var. marginata, commonly known as the pink lily or the Western Australian lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to the southwestern region of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of large, showy flowers with pink petals and a distinctive white or pink-edged throat. The flowers are typically borne in late summer to early autumn, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
