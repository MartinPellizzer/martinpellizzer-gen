    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian moonwort, is a fern-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, often bi-lobed fronds that resemble a crescent or moon shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of its fronds. This variety is notable for its primitive morphology and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
