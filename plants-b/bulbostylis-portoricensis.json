    "intro": "Bulbostylis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
