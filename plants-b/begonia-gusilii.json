    "intro": "Begonia gusilii, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Vietnam and Thailand. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in spring and summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
