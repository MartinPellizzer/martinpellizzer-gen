    "intro": "Berberis \u00d7 ottawensis, commonly known as the Ottawa barberry, is a hybrid shrub resulting from the cross between Berberis thunbergii and Berberis darwinii. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often managed carefully to prevent ecological disruption."
