It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bletia nagelii thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories."
