    "intro": "Bolophyta alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Bolophyta alpina has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
