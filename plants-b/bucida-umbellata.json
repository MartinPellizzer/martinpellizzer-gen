    "intro": "Bucida umbellata, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, where it thrives in sandy soils and salt spray. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture to help retain moisture in coastal conditions. Bucida umbellata is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
