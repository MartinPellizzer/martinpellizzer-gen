    "intro": "Bituminaria flaccida, commonly known as the silky bituminaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as steppes and grasslands. Its common name derives from the sticky, bituminous substance exuded from its leaves. Bituminaria flaccida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
