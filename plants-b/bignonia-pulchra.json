    "intro": "Bignonia pulchra, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous climbing vine that produces showy, yellow-orange, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins and is characterized by its strong, twining stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found along stream banks and in moist woodlands. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
