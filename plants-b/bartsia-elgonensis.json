    "intro": "Bartsia elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat, Bartsia elgonensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
