    "intro": "Barringtonia calyptrata, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a distinctive, spiky structure that contains several segments filled with edible, juicy pulp. The plant has a unique fruiting habit, with the fruit remaining on the tree for an extended period before splitting open. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit."
