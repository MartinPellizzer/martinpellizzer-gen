    "intro": "Buprestis frutescens, commonly known as the green metallic beetle, is a species of jewel beetle native to various parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking metallic green coloration, which becomes more vivid under different light conditions. The beetle's body is typically elongated and robust, with a hard, chitinous exoskeleton. It is often found in forested areas, where it feeds on the sap of trees and shrubs. Due to its iridescent appearance, it is a popular subject in entomological studies and insect collections."
