    "intro": "Bromus madritensis f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shaded brome, is a variant of the common brome grass. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in shaded environments. This subspecies is typically found in moist, woodland areas where light levels are lower. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
