    "intro": "Betula cajanderi, commonly known as the Mexican birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula cajanderi thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
