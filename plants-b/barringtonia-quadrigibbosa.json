    "intro": "Barringtonia quadrigibbosa, commonly known as the four-ridged banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that resemble lanterns. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in many regions."
