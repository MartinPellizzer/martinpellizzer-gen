    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. urbicus, commonly known as the urban brome, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments such as roadsides and vacant lots. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
