    "intro": "Bartsia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bartsia, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Bartsia sibirica is native to regions of Asia, including Siberia, Mongolia, and parts of China."
