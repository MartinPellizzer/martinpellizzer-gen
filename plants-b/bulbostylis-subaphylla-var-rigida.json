    "intro": "Bulbostylis subaphylla var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like structure with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses, and relies on wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The varietal form 'rigida' is distinguished by its stiff, upright growth and rigid leaf blades compared to the typical variety."
