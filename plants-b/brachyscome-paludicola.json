    "intro": "Brachyscome paludicola, commonly known as the swamp everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces a profusion of tiny flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Brachyscome paludicola is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions."
