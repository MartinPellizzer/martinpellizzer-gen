    "intro": "Breynia repens, commonly known as the wandering begonia, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Breynia repens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
