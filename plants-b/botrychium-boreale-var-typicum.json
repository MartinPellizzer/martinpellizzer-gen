    "intro": "Botrychium boreale var. typicum, commonly known as the northern moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single, broad, ovate leaf that is often divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, rounded cluster known as a sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium boreale var. typicum is a rare and specialized species, often growing in calcareous soils and demonstrating a preference for cool, humid climates."
