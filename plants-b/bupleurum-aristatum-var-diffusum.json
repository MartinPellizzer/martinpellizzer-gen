    "intro": "Bupleurum aristatum var. diffusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
