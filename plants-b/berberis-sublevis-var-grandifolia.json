    "intro": "Berberis sublevis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, thorny stems covered in a layer of fine, waxy hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and appear in spring before the leaves fully develop. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often contain seeds."
