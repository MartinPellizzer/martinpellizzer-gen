    "intro": "Brunfelsia latifolia, commonly known as the waxflower or Brazilian bellflower, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Brunfelsia latifolia is also noted for its ability to produce berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care."
