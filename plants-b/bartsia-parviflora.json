    "intro": "Bartsia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bartsia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in pairs along the stems, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Bartsia parviflora is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
