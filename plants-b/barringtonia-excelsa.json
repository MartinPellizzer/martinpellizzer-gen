    "intro": "Barringtonia excelsa, commonly known as the white cedar or candle bush, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release buoyant seeds, aiding in its dispersal by water. The plant has a distinctive, branched root system that helps stabilize its growth in coastal areas. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
