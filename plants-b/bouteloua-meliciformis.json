    "intro": "Bouteloua meliciformis, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of the United States and northern Mexico. It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant has fine, blue-green blades and produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable component of native plant communities."
