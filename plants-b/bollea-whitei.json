    "intro": "Bollea whitei, commonly known as the White's bollea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant white and pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bollea whitei is considered a species of conservation concern."
