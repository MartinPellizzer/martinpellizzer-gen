    "intro": "Bromus maximus subsp. macrantherus, commonly known as the giant brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, dense spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces a significant amount of seed, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, with a rough texture that aids in water retention."
