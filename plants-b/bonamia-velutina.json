It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
