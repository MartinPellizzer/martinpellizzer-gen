    "intro": "Bulbedulis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant with a striking botanical appearance. It features a bulb-like structure that serves as its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, pale purple flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic that aids in its pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The bulb is also edible when properly prepared, making it a valuable plant in certain cuisines."
