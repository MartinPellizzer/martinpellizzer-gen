    "intro": "Bassia lanceolata, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
