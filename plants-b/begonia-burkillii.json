It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
