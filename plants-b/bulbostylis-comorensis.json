    "intro": "Bulbostylis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to the Comoros archipelago. It is a small, perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
