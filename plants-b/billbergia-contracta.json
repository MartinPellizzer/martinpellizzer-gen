    "intro": "Billbergia contracta, commonly known as the compact billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are dark green with red margins and a central rosette of tightly packed, narrow leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia contracta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
