    "intro": "Braya humilis subsp. ellesmerensis, commonly known as the Ellesmera bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in tundra or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
