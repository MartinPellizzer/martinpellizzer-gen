    "intro": "Bauhinia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's bauhinia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often divided into small, fern-like segments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Bauhinia bakeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
