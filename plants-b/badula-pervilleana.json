    "intro": "Badula pervilleana, commonly known as the Perville's badula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
