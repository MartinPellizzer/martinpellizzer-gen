    "intro": "Bladhia villosa, commonly known as the woolly bladhia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Bladhia villosa is a perennial shrub that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds."
