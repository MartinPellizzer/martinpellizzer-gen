    "intro": "Bromus tacna, commonly known as Tacna brome, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus tacna plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
