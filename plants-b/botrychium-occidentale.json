    "intro": "Botrychium occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sorus. Botrychium occidentale thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. It is native to western North America and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
