    "intro": "Bradburya decumbens, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a sprawling, decumbent habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to arid conditions, storing water to help it survive in dry environments. Bradburya decumbens is well-suited for xeriscaping and is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun."
