    "intro": "Boronia montimulliganensis, commonly known as the Montimulligan boronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It is typically found growing in shaded, moist environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
