It features finely divided, arching fronds with a dark green hue and a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
