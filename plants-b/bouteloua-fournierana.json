    "intro": "Bouteloua fournierana, commonly known as the Fournier's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically rolled at the edges, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience. The species is named in honor of the French botanist Jean Baptiste Fournier."
