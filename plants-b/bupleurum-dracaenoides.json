It is a shrub-like plant native to the Canary Islands, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a reddish-brown resin, similar to dragon's blood, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its ornamental value and unique resin make it a notable species in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
