It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. The flowers are often clustered at the base of the pseudobulbs, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
