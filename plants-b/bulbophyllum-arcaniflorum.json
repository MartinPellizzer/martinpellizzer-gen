    "intro": "Bulbophyllum arcaniflorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with intricate patterns, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
