    "intro": "Binaria cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
