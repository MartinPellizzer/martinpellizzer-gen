    "intro": "Biscutella apula var. ciliata, commonly known as the Ciliated Biscutella, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that have ciliate margins, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
