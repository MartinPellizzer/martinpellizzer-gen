It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it is well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region.

It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
