    "intro": "Batrachium fluitans var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial frogfruit, is a rare variant of the aquatic frogfruit species. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Unlike its aquatic relative, this variant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces edible, berry-like fruits that are used in traditional herbal remedies. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to terrestrial conditions, making it a unique subject of study in plant ecology."
