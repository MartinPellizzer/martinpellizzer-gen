    "intro": "Bartlettina tuerckheimii, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, woody stems. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Bartlettina tuerckheimii is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions."
