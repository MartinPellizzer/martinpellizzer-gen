    "intro": "Bassia scrymgeouriae, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Bassia scrymgeouriae is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
