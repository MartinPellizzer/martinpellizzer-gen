    "intro": "Buxus muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1\u20132 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for hedges and ornamental planting. Its compact growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for topiary and garden design."
