    "intro": "Brongniartia suberea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown color and a fine, even texture. The plant has a straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing small, oval seeds. Due to its high value for musical instruments, Brongniartia suberea is listed as critically endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
