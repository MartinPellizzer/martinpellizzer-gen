    "intro": "Blechnum serrulatum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
