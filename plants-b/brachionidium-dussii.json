It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. Brachionidium dussii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
