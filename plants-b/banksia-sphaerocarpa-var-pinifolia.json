    "intro": "Banksia sphaerocarpa var. pinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones and narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. This variety is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
