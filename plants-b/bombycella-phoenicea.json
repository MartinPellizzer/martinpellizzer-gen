    "intro": "Bombycella phoenicea, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Bombycella phoenicea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
