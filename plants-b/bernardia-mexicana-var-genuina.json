    "intro": "Bernardia mexicana var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican Bernardia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
