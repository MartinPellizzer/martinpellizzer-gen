    "intro": "Berardia globosa, commonly known as the globular balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Berardia globosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
