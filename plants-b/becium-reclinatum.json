It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Becium reclinatum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from containers or hanging baskets."
