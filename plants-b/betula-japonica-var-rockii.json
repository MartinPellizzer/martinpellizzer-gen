It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and white, often peeling in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
