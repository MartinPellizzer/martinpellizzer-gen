    "intro": "Botrypus virginianus, commonly known as the eastern sword fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with tall, slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or drooping. The fronds are bi-lobed, with a distinctive, sword-like appearance, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
