    "intro": "Brya depressa, commonly known as the flat moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its tightly packed, cushion-like growth habit. The leaves are typically elongated and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. It is often found on soil surfaces, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Brya depressa is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, water-retaining structure."
