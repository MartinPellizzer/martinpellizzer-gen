    "intro": "Banisteriopsis elegans, commonly known as the \"blue bean\" or \"southern arrowleaf,\" is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and compound leaves with elliptical or arrow-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, globose capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Banisteriopsis elegans is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Amazonian medicine."
