    "intro": "Bromus preslii, commonly known as Presli's brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions. Bromus preslii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
