    "intro": "Bupleurum variabile var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf variable bupleurum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or form dense cushions, adapting to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
