    "intro": "Bletia rosea, commonly known as the rose orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, each with a three-lobed lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Bletia rosea thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
