    "intro": "Buxus liukiuensis var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-fruited Japanese boxwood, is a rare and unique variant of the boxwood genus. It is native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan and is characterized by its distinctive elongated, pedicellate (stalked) fruits. The plant typically grows as a low, dense shrub with small, glossy, dark green leaves. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it an ornamental plant with potential horticultural value. However, due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
