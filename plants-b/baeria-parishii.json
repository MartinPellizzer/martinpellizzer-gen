It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silver-gray leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Baeria parishii is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, arid environments."
