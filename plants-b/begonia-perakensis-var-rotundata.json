It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its unique foliage and ornamental appeal."
