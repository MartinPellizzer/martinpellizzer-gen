    "intro": "Buxus madagascarica subsp. xerophila, commonly known as the Madagascar boxwood, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are a food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
