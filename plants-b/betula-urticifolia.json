    "intro": "Betula urticifolia, commonly known as stinging birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are alternate, triangular, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
