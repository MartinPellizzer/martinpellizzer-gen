    "intro": "Bicuspidaria involucrata, commonly known as the two-cusped leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring two distinct cusps or lobes, which contribute to its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or pale yellow, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bicuspidaria involucrata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
