    "intro": "Baccharis perplexa, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable species in native plant restoration projects."
