    "intro": "Brachystelma coddii subsp. kituloense, commonly known as the Kitulo rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open grassland areas. It is adapted to cool, humid conditions and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
