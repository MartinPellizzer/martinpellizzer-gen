    "intro": "Brathys radicans, commonly known as the creeping brathis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over other surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warm seasons. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Brathys radicans is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
