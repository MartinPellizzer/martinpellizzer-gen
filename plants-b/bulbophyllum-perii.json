    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perii, commonly known as the Purple-veined Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers with contrasting white veins. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Bulbophyllum perii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
