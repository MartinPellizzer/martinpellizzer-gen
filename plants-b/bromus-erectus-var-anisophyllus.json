    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. anisophyllus, commonly known as the variable brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with linear, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are usually arranged in a loose, open structure. This variant is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its adaptability in different environmental conditions."
