It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue that adds visual interest. Briza calotheca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
