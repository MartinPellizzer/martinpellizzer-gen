    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-leaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage. This cultivar is distinguished by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical boxwood, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, exhibiting moderate growth and a dense, rounded form. The plant is highly resistant to pests and diseases, requiring minimal maintenance once established. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for topiary and formal garden designs."
