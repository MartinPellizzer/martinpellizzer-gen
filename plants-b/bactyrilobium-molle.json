    "intro": "Bactyrilobium molle, commonly known as the silky whitebark, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, silky-hair covered leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
