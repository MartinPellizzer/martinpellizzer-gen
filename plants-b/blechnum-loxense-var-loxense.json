    "intro": "Blechnum loxense var. loxense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical rainforests."
