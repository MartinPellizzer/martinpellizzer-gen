    "intro": "Bonamia schizantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bonamia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many species in the Solanaceae family. Bonamia schizantha is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation."
