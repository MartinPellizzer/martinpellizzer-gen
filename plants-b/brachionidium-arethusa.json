    "intro": "Brachionidium arethusa, commonly known as the golden starwort, is a small perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in shaded woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
