    "intro": "Boerhavia mathisiana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Boerhavia mathisiana is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun."
