    "intro": "Blechnum loxense var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
