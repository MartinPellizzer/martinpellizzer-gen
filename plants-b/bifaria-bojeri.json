    "intro": "Bifaria bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a daisy-like pattern. The plant has hairy, grey-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Bifaria bojeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
