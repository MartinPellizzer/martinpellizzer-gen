    "intro": "Botrys anthelminticus, commonly known as the parasitic bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that grows in wet, marshy environments, often in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is notable for its unique flowers, which are small and clustered in a spherical shape, resembling a cluster of bladders. Botrys anthelminticus is also known for its parasitic behavior, deriving some of its nutrients from other plants. Its name \"anthelminticus\" refers to its historical use in treating parasitic infections."
