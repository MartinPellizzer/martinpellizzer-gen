    "intro": "Backhousia, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and includes several species, such as Backhousia citriodora, which is renowned for its aromatic leaves. The leaves of Backhousia species are often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to their high concentration of citral, a compound responsible for their distinctive lemon scent. These plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, featuring glossy, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Their botanical significance lies in their unique chemical composition and traditional use in Indigenous Australian practices."
