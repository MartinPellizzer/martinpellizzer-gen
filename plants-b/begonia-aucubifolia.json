    "intro": "Begonia aucubifolia, commonly known as the aucuba-leaved begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of aucuba, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers with prominent yellow stamens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
