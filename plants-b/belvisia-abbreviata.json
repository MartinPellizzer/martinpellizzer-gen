    "intro": "Belvisia abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf belvisia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can withstand periods of drought. Belvisia abbreviata is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
