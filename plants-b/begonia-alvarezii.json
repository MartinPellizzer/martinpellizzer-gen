    "intro": "Begonia alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that often display intricate patterns and a striking red or purple hue. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
