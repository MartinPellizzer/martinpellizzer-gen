    "intro": "Beaumontia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved beaumontia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces fragrant, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle pink or purple tinge. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
