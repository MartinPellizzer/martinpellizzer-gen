    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies lucida is distinguished by its more reflective, shiny leaves compared to other subspecies of Biscutella laevigata."
