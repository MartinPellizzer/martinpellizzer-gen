    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in small, compact inflorescences, with lemmas that are hairy and often tinged with purple. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of soft, velvety hair, giving it its common name. Velvet brome is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
