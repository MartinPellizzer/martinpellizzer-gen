    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. trojana, commonly known as red beet or chard, is a cultivated variant of the beetroot plant. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous stems that can be green, white, or red in color. The leaves are edible and often used in cooking, while the root is typically harvested for its nutrient-rich, sweet flavor. This variety is valued for its high content of betalains, which give it its distinctive red color and provide antioxidant properties. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
