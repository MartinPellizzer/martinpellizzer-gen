    "intro": "Brachiaria mutica, commonly known as curly brachiaria, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for forage in tropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form thick mats."
