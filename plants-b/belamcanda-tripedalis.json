    "intro": "Belamcanda tripedalis, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features striking, dark red to black flowers that bloom in late summer, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily in moist, well-drained soils. Belamcanda tripedalis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in partial to full sun."
