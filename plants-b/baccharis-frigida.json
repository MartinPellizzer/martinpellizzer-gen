    "intro": "Baccharis frigida, commonly known as Mexican sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
