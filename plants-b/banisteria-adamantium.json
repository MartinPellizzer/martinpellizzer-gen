    "intro": "Banisteria adamantium, commonly known as the \"Adamantium\" or \"Ironwood\" tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain hard, angular seeds. Its wood is exceptionally hard and durable, making it highly valued for construction and tool-making. Banisteria adamantium thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish."
