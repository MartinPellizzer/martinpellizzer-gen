    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bakoense, commonly known as the Bako orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
