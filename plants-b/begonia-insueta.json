    "intro": "Begonia insueta, commonly known as the pale begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a pale green to almost white coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage, which often serves as the primary attraction of the plant."
