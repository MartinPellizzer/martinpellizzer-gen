    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Bromus ciliatus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
