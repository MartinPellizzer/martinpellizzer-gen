    "intro": "Basistelma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized. Basistelma thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
