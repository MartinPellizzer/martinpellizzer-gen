It is characterized by its striking white petals and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows as an upright herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds.
