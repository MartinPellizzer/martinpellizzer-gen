    "intro": "Beckmannia eruciformis var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its soft, hairless leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in temperate regions."
