    "intro": "Betula utilis var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with multiple stems arising from the base. The leaves are alternate, oval, and hairy, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This hardy species is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
