    "intro": "Blechnum volubile, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground or climb on structures. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or near water sources. The plant's ability to climb makes it an effective ground cover in humid climates."
