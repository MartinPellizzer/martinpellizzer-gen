    "intro": "Boechera perennans subsp. spatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf rockcress, is a perennial member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to rocky and gravelly habitats in the western United States, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, and the plant is known for its ability to self-seed, contributing to its presence in disturbed areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
