    "intro": "Brachistus lanceifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brachistus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
