    "intro": "Blechnum spicant var. crenatum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to New Zealand. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, serrated margins that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
