    "intro": "Bromus subrectus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus subrectus is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments."
