    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subtenellum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed torch orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and striking, torch-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. Bulbophyllum subtenellum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
