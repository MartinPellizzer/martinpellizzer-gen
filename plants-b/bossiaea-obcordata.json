    "intro": "Bossiaea obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bossiaea obcordata is also known for its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and birds."
