    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. lunaria, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the Onocleaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant is usually found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect, spore-bearing stalk that emerges from the base of the fronds. Botrychium lunaria var. lunaria is an ancient fern species that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
