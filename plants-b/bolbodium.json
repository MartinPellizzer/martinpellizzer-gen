    "intro": "Bolbodium, commonly known as the bladder fungus, is a unique plant-like organism that belongs to the family Hydnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like fruiting bodies that resemble bladders, hence its common name. The structure of Bolbodium is primarily composed of a fleshy, gelatinous body that contains spores within its hollow interior. It typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, and its life cycle involves both saprophytic and parasitic phases. Despite its fungal nature, Bolbodium is often mistaken for a plant due to its appearance and growth habits."
