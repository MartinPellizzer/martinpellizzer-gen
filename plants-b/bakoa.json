    "intro": "Bakoa, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Bakoa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
