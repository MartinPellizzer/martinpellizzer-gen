    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. pubirhachis, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
