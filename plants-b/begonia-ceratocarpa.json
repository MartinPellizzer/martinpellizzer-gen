    "intro": "Begonia ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like tubers that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, fleshy leaves that are often brightly colored, and it blooms with small, pale flowers that are typically clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
