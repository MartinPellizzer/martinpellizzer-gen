    "intro": "Bromelia paniculata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, waxy, strap-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its ornamental appeal. Bromelia paniculata thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
