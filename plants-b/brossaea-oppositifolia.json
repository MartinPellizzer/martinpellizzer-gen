    "intro": "Brossaea oppositifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf brossaea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect the intense sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Brossaea oppositifolia is a perennial shrub that plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
