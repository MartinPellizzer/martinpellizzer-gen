    "intro": "Bromus segetalis f. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a variant of the annual grass species Bromus segetalis. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive velvety texture. This grass is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can become a weed. Its growth habit includes a compact, low-growing form with dense foliage. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, typical of the Poaceae family."
