    "intro": "Briza media, commonly known as quaking grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Briza media is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also found in meadows and along stream banks."
