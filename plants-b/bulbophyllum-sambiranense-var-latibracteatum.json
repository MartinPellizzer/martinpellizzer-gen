    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sambiranense var. latibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-bract Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, showy inflorescences with large, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted for water storage in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging species to cultivate."
