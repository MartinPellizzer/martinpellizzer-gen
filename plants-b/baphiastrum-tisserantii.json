It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the wet season. Baphiastrum tisserantii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its rarity and beauty. However, it is sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific conditions to thrive."
