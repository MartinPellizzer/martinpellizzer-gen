    "intro": "Bulbocodium ruthenicum, commonly known as the Russian bulbous gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. The plant grows from a bulbous rootstock, which allows it to survive in dry, rocky habitats. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry soil landscapes."
