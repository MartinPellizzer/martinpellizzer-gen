    "intro": "Berberis approximata, commonly known as the coastal barberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features slender, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping along the Pacific coast."
