    "intro": "Bauhinia aculeata, commonly known as the crowned acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its stems and leaves are often covered with small, sharp spines, giving it a rugged appearance. Bauhinia aculeata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
