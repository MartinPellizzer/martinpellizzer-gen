    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The bark is typically smooth and light gray, with some varieties displaying a peeling, flaky texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This plant is adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in tundra and mountainous areas."
