    "intro": "Bifrenaria bicornaria, commonly known as the two-lobed liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that is typically divided into two distinct lobes. The plant is usually found growing on moist, shaded rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered near the margins of the thallus. Bifrenaria bicornaria plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
