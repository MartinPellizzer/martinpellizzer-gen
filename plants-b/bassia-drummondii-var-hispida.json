    "intro": "Bassia drummondii var. hispida, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry environments."
