    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subvar. villosum, commonly known as hairy wood rush, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
