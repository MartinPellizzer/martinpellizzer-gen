    "intro": "Blepharizonia plumosa var. subplumosa, commonly known as the silky feather fern, is a variant of the silky feather fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce aerial roots. Its leaves are typically light green and have a silky texture due to the fine, hair-like structures on their surface. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
