    "intro": "Baccharis phagnaloides, commonly known as smooth baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually smooth and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Smooth baccharis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in moist environments."
