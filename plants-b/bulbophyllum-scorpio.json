    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scorpio, commonly known as the Scorpio Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for collectors and horticulturists."
