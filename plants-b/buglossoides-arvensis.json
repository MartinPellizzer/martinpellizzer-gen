It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and blue to purple flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, ovate leaves with ciliate margins and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Buglossoides arvensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
