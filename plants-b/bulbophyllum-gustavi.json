    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its bulb-like structures store nutrients, aiding in its survival in less fertile soils. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and yellow."
