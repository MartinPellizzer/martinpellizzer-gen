    "intro": "Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bifrenaria, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. The plant has slender, upright stems and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding species for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
