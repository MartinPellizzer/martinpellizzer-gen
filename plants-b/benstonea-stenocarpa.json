It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
