    "intro": "Baccharis linearifolia subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, white to yellowish flower clusters that appear in the fall. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and maritime hammocks. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its ecological importance is significant in coastal ecosystems due to its resilience to salt spray and wind."
