It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
