    "intro": "Buddleja diversifolia, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, butterfly-pollinated flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, egg-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, ornamental plant. Buddleja diversifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
