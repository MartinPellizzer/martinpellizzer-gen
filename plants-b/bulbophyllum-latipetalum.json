It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. Bulbophyllum latipetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
