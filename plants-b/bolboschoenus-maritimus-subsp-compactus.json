It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
