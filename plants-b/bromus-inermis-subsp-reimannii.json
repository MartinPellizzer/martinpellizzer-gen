    "intro": "Bromus inermis subsp. reimannii, commonly known as Reimann's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Reimann's brome is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
