    "intro": "Bridelia angolensis var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its deep root system and water-storing tissues. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The Welwitschia is also notable for its slow growth rate and longevity, with some individuals living over 1,000 years."
