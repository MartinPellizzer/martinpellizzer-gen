    "intro": "Blechnum appendiculatum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, bright yellow to golden-green segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum appendiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
