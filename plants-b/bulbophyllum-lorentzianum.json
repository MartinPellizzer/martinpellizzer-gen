    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lorentzianum, commonly known as the Lorentzian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
