    "intro": "Bulbophyllum proculcastris, commonly known as the Crimson Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant red and purple flowers, which are highly unusual in the orchid family. The plant grows epiphytically on trees, relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients rather than soil. Its bulbs, which are essential for its survival, store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
