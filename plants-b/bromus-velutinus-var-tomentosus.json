    "intro": "Bromus velutinus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with lemmas that are often hairy and awnless. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization."
