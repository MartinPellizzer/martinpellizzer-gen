    "intro": "Briza media var. stolonifera, commonly known as the tufted feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear small, fluffy panicles of pale green to golden yellow flowers. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats or clumps, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is fine and grass-like, with a soft texture that adds a delicate appearance to landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
