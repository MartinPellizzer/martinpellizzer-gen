    "intro": "Bulbophyllum curvibulbum, commonly known as the curved bulb orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its rhizomes are characterized by their swollen, bulb-like structures. It has fibrous roots and a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its unique morphology and habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
