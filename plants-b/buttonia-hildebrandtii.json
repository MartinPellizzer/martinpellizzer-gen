It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Buttonia hildebrandtii is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
