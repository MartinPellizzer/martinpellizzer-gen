    "intro": "Bidens mariana, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 2 feet tall, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, allowing them to be dispersed by wind. Bidens mariana plays an important role in supporting native wildlife and is often found in marshy or moist soil environments."
