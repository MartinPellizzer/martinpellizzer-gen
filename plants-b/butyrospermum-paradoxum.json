    "intro": "Butyrospermum paradoxum, commonly known as shea tree or African butter tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa. It produces a large, smooth, green fruit that turns yellow when mature. The fruit's pulp contains a high amount of oils, which are extracted to make shea butter. This butter is rich in vitamins A and E and has emollient properties. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and soil conservation."
