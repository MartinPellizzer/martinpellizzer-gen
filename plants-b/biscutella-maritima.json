    "intro": "Biscutella maritima, commonly known as sea biscuit, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds typical of maritime environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize coastal dunes and cliffs. Biscutella maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
