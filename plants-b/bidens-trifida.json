    "intro": "Bidens trifida, commonly known as common beggarlice, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with two ray florets, followed by distinctive spiny seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it is considered a weed in many regions."
