It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a thalloid structure and leaf-like structures arranged in a star-like pattern. It produces spore capsules that are borne on short stalks, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Bolbophyllaria pentasticha is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed habitats."
