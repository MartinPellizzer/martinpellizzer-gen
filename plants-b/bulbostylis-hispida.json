    "intro": "Bulbostylis hispida, commonly known as the hairy bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, erect leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or moist soils. Bulbostylis hispida is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
