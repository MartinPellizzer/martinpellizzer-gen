    "intro": "Brunsvigia bosmaniae, commonly known as the Bosman's fireball, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, spherical inflorescences composed of numerous pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that die back after flowering, making it a short-lived perennial. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
