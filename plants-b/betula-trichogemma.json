    "intro": "Betula trichogemma, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. Betula trichogemma is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
