    "intro": "Bletia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, with its inflorescence bearing numerous tiny, fragrant flowers. Bletia densiflora prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a unique and relatively rare species within the orchid family."
