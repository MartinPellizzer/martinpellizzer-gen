    "intro": "Bulbophyllum superpositum, commonly known as the stacked orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, where multiple pseudobulbs are stacked atop one another, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. Bulbophyllum superpositum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
