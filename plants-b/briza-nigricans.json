    "intro": "Briza nigricans, commonly known as black false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and panicles of small, spike-like flowers that turn brown as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Briza nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
