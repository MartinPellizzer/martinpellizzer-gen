    "intro": "Blechnum auriculatum var. typicum, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
