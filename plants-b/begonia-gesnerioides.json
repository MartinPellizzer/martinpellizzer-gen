    "intro": "Begonia gesnerioides, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is widely cultivated in horticulture."
