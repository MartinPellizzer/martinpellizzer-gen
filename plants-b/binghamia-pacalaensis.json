    "intro": "Binghamia pacalaensis, commonly known as the Pala Peninsula lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pala Peninsula in Queensland, Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats. The plant produces striking, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, bell-shaped structure. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Binghamia pacalaensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
