It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Bromus molliformis var. glabrescens is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands."
