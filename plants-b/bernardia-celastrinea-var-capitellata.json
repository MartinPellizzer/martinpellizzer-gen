    "intro": "Bernardia celastrinea var. capitellata, commonly known as the clustered bernardia, is a deciduous shrub native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It features small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its woody structure and compact growth habit make it a distinctive member of the Celastraceae family. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
