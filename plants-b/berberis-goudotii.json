    "intro": "Berberis goudotii, commonly known as the African barberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or consuming them."
