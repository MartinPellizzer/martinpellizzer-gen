    "intro": "Bumelia, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Bumelia species are characterized by their spiny stems and vibrant, often showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Some species of Bumelia are also known for their edible fruits, which are similar to those of the prickly pear cactus."
