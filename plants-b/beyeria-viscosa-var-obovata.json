    "intro": "Beyeria viscosa var. obovata, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a glandular surface that secretes a sticky substance. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
