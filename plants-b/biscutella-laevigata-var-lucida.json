    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. lucida, commonly known as the shining biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and forms a dense network, which helps it thrive in rocky and dry soils. This variety is noted for its unique appearance and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats."
