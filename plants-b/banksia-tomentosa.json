    "intro": "Banksia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey foliage and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that release seeds after a fire, a feature that aids in its regeneration in fire-prone ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The woolly banksia is an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for nectar-feeding birds and insects."
