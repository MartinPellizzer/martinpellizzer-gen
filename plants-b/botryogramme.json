    "intro": "Botryogramme, commonly known as the \"buttercup liverwort,\" is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a simple, non-vascular system and reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Botryogramme species are often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain microhabitats."
