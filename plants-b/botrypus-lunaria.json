    "intro": "Botrypus lunaria, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a moon's surface, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Botrypus lunaria has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spores necessary for its propagation. It is a relatively rare and ancient species, often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions."
