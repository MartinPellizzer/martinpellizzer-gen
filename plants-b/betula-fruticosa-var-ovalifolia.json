    "intro": "Betula fruticosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf birch, is a shrub-like species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a slight reddish tinge, and it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
