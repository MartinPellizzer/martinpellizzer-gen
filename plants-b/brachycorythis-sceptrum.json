    "intro": "Brachycorythis sceptrum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Brachycorythis sceptrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in various traditional practices."
