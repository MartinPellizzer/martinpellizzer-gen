It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in dense clusters, with two to three bisexual florets per spikelet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is adapted to harsh climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
