    "intro": "Bauhinia isopetala, commonly known as the velvetwood or flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are legumes that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Bauhinia isopetala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
