    "intro": "Bakerella clavata var. elongalata, commonly known as the elongated clavate bakerella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that remain on the plant throughout the winter, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
