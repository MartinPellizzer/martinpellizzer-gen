It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with intricate, lobed margins that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among plant enthusiasts for its foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
