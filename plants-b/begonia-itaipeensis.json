    "intro": "Begonia itaipeensis, commonly known as the Itaipeensis begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from dark green to deep purple. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
