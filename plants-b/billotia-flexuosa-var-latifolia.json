    "intro": "Billotia flexuosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved billotia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. The varietal form, latifolia, distinguishes it from other varieties by its wider leaf structure."
