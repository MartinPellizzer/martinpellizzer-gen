    "intro": "Bolbitis lonchophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it has a creeping growth habit that allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
