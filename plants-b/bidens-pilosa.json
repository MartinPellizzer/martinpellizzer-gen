    "intro": "Bidens pilosa, commonly known as Spanish needle or beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by white, hair-like bracts. The plant produces seeds with barbed structures that attach to clothing or animal fur, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Bidens pilosa is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
