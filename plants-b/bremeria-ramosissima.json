    "intro": "Bremeria ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its branched, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants. It produces small, pale flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
