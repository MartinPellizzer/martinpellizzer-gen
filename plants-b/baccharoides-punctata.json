    "intro": "Baccharoides punctata, commonly known as the punctate baccharoid, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive white-veined pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens."
