    "intro": "Betencourtia crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved betencourtia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
