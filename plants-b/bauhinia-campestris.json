    "intro": "Bauhinia campestris, commonly known as the Field Bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Bauhinia campestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
