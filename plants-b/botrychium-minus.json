    "intro": "Botrychium minus, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a small fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a central stalk with a cluster of small, spore-producing structures called sorocarps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium minus has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. Its delicate appearance and specialized habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
