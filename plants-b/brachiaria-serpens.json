    "intro": "Brachiaria serpens, commonly known as slinkgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Americas. It has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across open areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Brachiaria serpens is commonly found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
