    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
