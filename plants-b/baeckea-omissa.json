    "intro": "Baeckea omissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baeckea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, thriving in well-drained sandy soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Baeckea omissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
