    "intro": "Bulbine flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Bulbine flexuosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
