    "intro": "Baccharis subumbelliformis, commonly known as the slender baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
