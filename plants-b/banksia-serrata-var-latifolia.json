It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
