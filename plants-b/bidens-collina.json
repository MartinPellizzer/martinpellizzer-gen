    "intro": "Bidens collina, commonly known as common beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers with two ray florets. The plant is characterized by its prickly, bristly stems and seeds that are attached to a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Bidens collina is a common weed but also serves as a food source for various insects and birds."
