    "intro": "Bertiera angusiana, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Bertiera angusiana is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
