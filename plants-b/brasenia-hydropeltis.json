    "intro": "Brasenia hydropeltis, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body. Brasenia hydropeltis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
