    "intro": "Balanophora zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves and stems, with its entire structure composed of a single, fleshy, often reddish or purple-colored body. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale in color. Due to its elusive nature and specialized habitat, Balanophora zollingeri is considered a challenging subject for botanical study."
