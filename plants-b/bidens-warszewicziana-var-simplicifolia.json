    "intro": "Bidens warszewicziana var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simpleleaf beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
