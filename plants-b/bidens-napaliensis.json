    "intro": "Bidens napaliensis, commonly known as the Napali ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which are characteristic of the Bidens genus. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Bidens napaliensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
