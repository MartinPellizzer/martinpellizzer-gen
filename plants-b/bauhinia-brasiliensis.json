    "intro": "Bauhinia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ornamental, and often palmate leaves that resemble orchid petals, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bauhinia brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
