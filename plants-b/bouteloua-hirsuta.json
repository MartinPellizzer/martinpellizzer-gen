    "intro": "Bouteloua hirsuta, commonly known as hairy grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Hairy grama is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
