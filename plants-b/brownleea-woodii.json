    "intro": "Brownleea woodii, commonly known as the Wood's brownleea, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Mexico. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting throat markings. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Brownleea woodii is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
