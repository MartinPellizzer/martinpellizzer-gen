    "intro": "Betula microdontia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grayish-brown bark and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. Betula microdontia thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests or rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
