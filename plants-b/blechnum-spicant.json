    "intro": "Blechnum spicant, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, recurved shape. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a spiky pattern, giving it its scientific name \"spicant.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Blechnum spicant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
