    "intro": "Begonia thermarum, commonly known as the hot spring begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a deep green color with intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, fleshy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
