    "intro": "Bursaria tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bursaria, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that turn red as they mature. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional Indigenous Australian medicine for their purported healing properties. Bursaria tenuifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal landscapes."
