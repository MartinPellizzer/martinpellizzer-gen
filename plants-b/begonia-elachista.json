    "intro": "Begonia elachista, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal. It has a fibrous root system and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia elachista is valued for its unique foliage and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
