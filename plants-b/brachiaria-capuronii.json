It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Brachiaria capuronii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
