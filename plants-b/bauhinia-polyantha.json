    "intro": "Bauhinia polyantha, commonly known as the jeweled bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature. Bauhinia polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
