    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. radiata, commonly known as the tickseed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and yellow flowers with radiating rays. The plant produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
