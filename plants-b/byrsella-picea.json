    "intro": "Byrsella picea, commonly known as the black alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Byrsella picea is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
