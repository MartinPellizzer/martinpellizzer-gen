    "intro": "Bulbostylis neocapitata, commonly known as the New Caledonia bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
