It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The tree is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Bidoupia phongii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
