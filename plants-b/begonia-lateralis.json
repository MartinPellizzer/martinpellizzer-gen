    "intro": "Begonia lateralis, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
