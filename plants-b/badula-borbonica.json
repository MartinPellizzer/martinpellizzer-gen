    "intro": "Badula borbonica, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and produces clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a prized species among orchid enthusiasts."
