    "intro": "Bulbostylis somaliensis subsp. confusa, commonly known as the Somali bulbostylis, is a rare grass species native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its small, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale brown flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
