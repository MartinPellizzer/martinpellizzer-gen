    "intro": "Brongniartia coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Brongniartia coriacea is typically found in moist, tropical forest environments, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
