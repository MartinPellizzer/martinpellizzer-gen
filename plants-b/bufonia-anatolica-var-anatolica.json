    "intro": "Bufonia anatolica var. anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian bufonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Anatolia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant has adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Bufonia anatolica var. anatolica is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
