    "intro": "Bellevalia pelagica, commonly known as the sea bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Bellevalia pelagica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
