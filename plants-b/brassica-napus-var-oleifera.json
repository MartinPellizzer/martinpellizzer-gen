It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to produce canola oil. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has compound leaves with serrated edges. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Rapeseed is also used as a cover crop and for animal feed due to its rapid growth and nutrient density."
