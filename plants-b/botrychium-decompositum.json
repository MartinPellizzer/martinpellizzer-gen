    "intro": "Botrychium decompositum, commonly known as the fragmented moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, erect rhizome and a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a distinctive, branching pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Botrychium decompositum is a small plant, typically growing to a height of less than 10 centimeters."
