    "intro": "Buchnera nyassica, commonly known as the East African bitter melon, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, bitter-tasting fruits. Buchnera nyassica is often grown for its edible fruits, though they are known for their strong, sometimes unpleasant flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
