    "intro": "Bassia quinquecuspis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy jointed grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This species is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
