    "intro": "Brassica napus var. brevirostris, commonly known as the short-beaked rape, is a variant of the oilseed rape species. It is characterized by its compact, short beak-like structure on the siliqua, distinguishing it from other Brassica species. This variety is primarily cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in both culinary and industrial applications. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important crop in agricultural systems, particularly for biodiesel production."
