    "intro": "Baeria aristata var. parishii, commonly known as the Parry's baeria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, showcasing adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a bluish-gray hue, while its small, white flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
