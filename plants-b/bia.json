    "intro": "Bia, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with stems that often remain close to the ground. Bia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom throughout the year makes it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
