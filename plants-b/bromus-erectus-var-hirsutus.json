    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. hirsutus, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus erectus var. hirsutus is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in arid and semi-arid environments."
