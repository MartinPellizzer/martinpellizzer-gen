    "intro": "Brachystelma kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's stone orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It produces compact, rounded pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and bears delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms during the warmer months, typically from late winter to early spring. Brachystelma kerrii is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
