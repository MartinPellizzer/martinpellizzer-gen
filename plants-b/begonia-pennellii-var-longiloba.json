    "intro": "Begonia pennellii var. longiloba, commonly known as the long-stalked begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to red or purple. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
