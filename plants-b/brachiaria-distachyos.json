    "intro": "Brachiaria distachyos, commonly known as silver grass or silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tinged leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Brachiaria distachyos produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
