    "intro": "Brachycorythis lastii, commonly known as the lastii cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are dark green and narrow. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink cones that are typically borne on separate male and female plants. Brachycorythis lastii is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
