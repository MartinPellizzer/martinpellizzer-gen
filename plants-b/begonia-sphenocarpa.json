    "intro": "Begonia sphenocarpa, commonly known as the diamond begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, diamond-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and purple. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
