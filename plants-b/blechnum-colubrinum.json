    "intro": "Blechnum colubrinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
