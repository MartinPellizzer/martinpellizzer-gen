    "intro": "Bulbophyllum punctulatum, commonly known as the speckled orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces showy, white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns of dark markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
