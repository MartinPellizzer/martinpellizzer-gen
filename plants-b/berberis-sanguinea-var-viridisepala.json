    "intro": "Berberis sanguinea var. viridisepala, commonly known as the green-sepal barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, spiny leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in late summer. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent berries, which provide food for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
