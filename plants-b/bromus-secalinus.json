    "intro": "Bromus secalinus, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus secalinus is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
