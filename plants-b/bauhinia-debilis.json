    "intro": "Bauhinia debilis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often shed during the dry season, and its trunk is typically smooth with a greyish-brown bark. Bauhinia debilis thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is also valued for its ability to withstand drought conditions once established."
