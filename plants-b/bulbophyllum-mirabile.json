    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mirabile, commonly known as the miracle orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
