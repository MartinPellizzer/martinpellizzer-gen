    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum var. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a small fern-like plant characterized by its delicate, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has a unique morphology with a narrow, segmented stem and small, lanceolate leaves that are often dissected. Its reproductive structures are clustered in a rosette at the base, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
