The plant typically grows from a short, tuberous root system and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and appear in dense, spherical clusters. Benthamia capitata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
