It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features small yellow flowers with ray florets and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are covered in fine hairs, aiding in wind dispersal, and it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Bidens infirma is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
