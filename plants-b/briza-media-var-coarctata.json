    "intro": "Briza media var. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf quaking grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
