    "intro": "Bolbitis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are thick and leathery. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Bolbitis tibetica is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
