    "intro": "Banksia speciosa, commonly known as the large banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia speciosa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
