    "intro": "Balanophora hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's orchid, is a holoparasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, making it a root-parasite. The plant has a short, stocky stem with dense, fleshy roots that attach to the roots of its host. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish, and are pollinated by insects. It is native to tropical regions of South and Central America, growing in humid, shaded environments."
