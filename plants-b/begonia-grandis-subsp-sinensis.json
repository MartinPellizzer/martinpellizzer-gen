It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from summer to autumn. It prefers partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and prolonged flowering period."
