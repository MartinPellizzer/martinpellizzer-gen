    "intro": "Begonia boucheana, commonly known as the Bouch\u00e9's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that range in color from deep red to dark green, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shade gardens."
