    "intro": "Bulbophyllum niveum, commonly known as the White Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
