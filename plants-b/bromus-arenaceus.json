It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open areas effectively. Bromus arenaceus is often found in coastal dunes, grasslands, and along roadsides."
