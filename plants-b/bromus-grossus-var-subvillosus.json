    "intro": "Bromus grossus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
