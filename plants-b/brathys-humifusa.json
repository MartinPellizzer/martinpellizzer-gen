    "intro": "Brathys humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has wiry, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Brathys humifusa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
