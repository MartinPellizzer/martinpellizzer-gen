    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. subulatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often concealed within the foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
