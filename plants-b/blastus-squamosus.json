    "intro": "Blastus squamosus, commonly known as the scaly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has finely divided, floating leaves. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with four to five petals. The scaly appearance of its stems and leaves is a distinctive botanical feature."
