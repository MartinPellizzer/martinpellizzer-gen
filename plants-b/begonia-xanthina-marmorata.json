    "intro": "Begonia xanthina marmorata, commonly known as the marble begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that display a marbled pattern of light green and white. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
