    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, similar to its parent species, the paper birch. The tree produces small, cone-like fruiting bodies that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and serrated, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula \u00d7 eastwoodiae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
