    "intro": "Bernardia pulchella, commonly known as the purple-leafed berberis, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which contrasts with its yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections in temperate regions."
