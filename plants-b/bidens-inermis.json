    "intro": "Bidens inermis, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from summer to fall, and its seeds are often covered in fine hairs that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are serrated and hairy, and it has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes."
