    "intro": "Bacopa punctata, commonly known as the punctate water bead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy environments. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive white or pale green calyx. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture. Bacopa punctata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
