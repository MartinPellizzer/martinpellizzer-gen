    "intro": "Brunellia integrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically entire, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its adaptability to different soil types and climates has made it a common ornamental plant in tropical regions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
