    "intro": "Betula nana var. relicta, commonly known as the relic dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of only a few centimeters, and its distinctive white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are small, oval, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This hardy plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments."
