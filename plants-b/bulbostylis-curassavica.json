    "intro": "Bulbostylis curassavica, commonly known as the Caribbean bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Bulbostylis curassavica is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Central and South America."
