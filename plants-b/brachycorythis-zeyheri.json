    "intro": "Brachycorythis zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
