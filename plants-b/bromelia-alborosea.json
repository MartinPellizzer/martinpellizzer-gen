    "intro": "Bromelia alborosea, commonly known as the white rosette bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-green rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual impact. Its foliage is adapted to retain moisture in humid, shaded environments, making it well-suited for tropical climates. Bromelia alborosea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
