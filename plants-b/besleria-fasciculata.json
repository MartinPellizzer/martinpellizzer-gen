    "intro": "Besleria fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange or red flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its vibrant appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
