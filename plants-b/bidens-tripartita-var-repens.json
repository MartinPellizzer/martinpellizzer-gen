    "intro": "Bidens tripartita var. repens, commonly known as creeping ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist to wet habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, with three distinct lobes. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
