    "intro": "Byttneria beyrichiana, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a large, fast-growing tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, spherical fruits. It is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils. The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
