    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys var. triaristatus, commonly known as the three-awned brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, tufted inflorescences. The plant produces spikelets with three awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This grass is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
