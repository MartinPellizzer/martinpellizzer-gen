    "intro": "Briza poa, commonly known as quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and feathery, drooping inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across various habitats. Briza poa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
