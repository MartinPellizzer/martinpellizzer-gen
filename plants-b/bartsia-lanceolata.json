    "intro": "Bartsia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the moist woodlands of eastern North America. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with two lips, typical of the Orobanchaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in shaded, nutrient-rich soils. Bartsia lanceolata is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
