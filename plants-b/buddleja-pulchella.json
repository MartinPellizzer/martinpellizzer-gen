    "intro": "Buddleja pulchella, commonly known as the Mexican butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which release seeds through a mechanism involving a spring-like structure. Buddleja pulchella thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
