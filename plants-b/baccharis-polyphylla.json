    "intro": "Baccharis polyphylla, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the fall, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Baccharis polyphylla is drought-tolerant and has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
