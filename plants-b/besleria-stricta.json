    "intro": "Besleria stricta, commonly known as the silver spider lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features tall, erect stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with intricate, spider-like petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
