    "intro": "Betula utilis subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale greenish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
