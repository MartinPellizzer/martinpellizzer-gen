    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery leaves that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant produces large, cylindrical flower spikes that are yellow to orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal heathlands. This variety is notable for its ecological importance and is a key species in the region's biodiversity."
