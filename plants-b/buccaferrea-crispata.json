    "intro": "Buccaferrea crispata, commonly known as the wrinkled bark tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, peeling bark that gives it its common name, and its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish-white in color, followed by orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
