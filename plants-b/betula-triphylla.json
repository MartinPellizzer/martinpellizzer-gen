    "intro": "Betula triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves that are typically arranged in threes, giving it its common name. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Betula triphylla is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
