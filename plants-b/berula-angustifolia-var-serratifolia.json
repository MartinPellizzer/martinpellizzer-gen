    "intro": "Berula angustifolia var. serratifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and serrated, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds and streams. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
