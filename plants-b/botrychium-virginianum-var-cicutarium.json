    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. cicutarium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are divided into small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a rosette pattern, which is a key identifying feature. The species is native to North America and is often found in the eastern United States."
