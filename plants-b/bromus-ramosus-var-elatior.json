    "intro": "Bromus ramosus var. elatior, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
