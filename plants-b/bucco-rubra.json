    "intro": "Bucco rubra, commonly known as the red cheeked orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, which are often marked with contrasting white or pink streaks. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives on the forest floor or on the bases of trees. Its flowers are relatively small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bucco rubra is considered a rare and endangered species."
