    "intro": "Briza multiflora, commonly known as quaking grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, arching inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its slender, leafless stems bear clusters of spikelets, which are the flowering structures of grasses. Briza multiflora is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful appearance and is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
