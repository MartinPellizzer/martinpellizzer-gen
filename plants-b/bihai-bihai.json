    "intro": "Bihai bihai, commonly known as the giant panda plant, is a striking member of the Crassulaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its large, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often a striking combination of green and white. The plant is noted for its ability to store water in its thick, succulent leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
