    "intro": "Bonannia resinifera, commonly known as the resinous bonannia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stem and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a thick, aromatic resin from its bark, which has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. Bonannia resinifera plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
