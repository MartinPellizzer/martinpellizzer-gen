    "intro": "Boraginella angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandworts, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, fleshy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Boraginella angustifolia is often found in sandy soils and is part of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value."
