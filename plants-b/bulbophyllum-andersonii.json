    "intro": "Bulbophyllum andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically featuring a yellow or green base with contrasting purple or red markings. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
