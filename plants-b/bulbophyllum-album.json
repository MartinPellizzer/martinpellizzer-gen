    "intro": "Bulbophyllum album, commonly known as the white bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with intricate patterns, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
