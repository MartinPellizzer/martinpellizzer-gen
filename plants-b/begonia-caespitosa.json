    "intro": "Begonia caespitosa, commonly known as the mossy begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It features a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form compact clumps, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The leaves are usually glossy and can vary in color from green to reddish hues depending on light exposure."
