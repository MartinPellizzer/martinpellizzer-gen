It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care. Begonia nana is also valued for its ability to thrive in cool indoor conditions."
