It features small, narrow leaves arranged in whorls along its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
