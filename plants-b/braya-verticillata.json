    "intro": "Braya verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats. Braya verticillata is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, making it a characteristic component of high-latitude ecosystems."
