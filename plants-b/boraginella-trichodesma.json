    "intro": "Boraginella trichodesma, commonly known as the hairy sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, which is characterized by its hairy stems and often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats of small, oval leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale blue or lavender, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Boraginella trichodesma is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
