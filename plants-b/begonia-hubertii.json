    "intro": "Begonia hubertii, commonly known as the Congo begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep red to dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of rare plants."
