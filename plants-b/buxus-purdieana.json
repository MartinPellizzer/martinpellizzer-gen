    "intro": "Buxus purdieana, commonly known as the Cape boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Buxus purdieana is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form neat, clipped shapes."
