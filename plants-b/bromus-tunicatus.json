    "intro": "Bromus tunicatus, commonly known as the tunicate brome, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, tubular inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of hair, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Bromus tunicatus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
