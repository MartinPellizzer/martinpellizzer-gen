    "intro": "Banksia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically orange-red in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia ferruginea is adapted to fire-prone environments and often regenerates after bushfires. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
