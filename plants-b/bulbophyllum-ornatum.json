    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ornatum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the night. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, often attaching to trees in tropical rainforests. The flowers display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
