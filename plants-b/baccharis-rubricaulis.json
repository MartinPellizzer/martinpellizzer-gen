    "intro": "Baccharis rubricaulis, commonly known as scarlet baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Baccharis rubricaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
