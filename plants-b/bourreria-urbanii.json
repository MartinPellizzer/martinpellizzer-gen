    "intro": "Bourreria urbanii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bourreria urbanii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
