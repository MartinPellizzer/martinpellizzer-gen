    "intro": "Butia lallemantii, commonly known as the Lallemant's palm, is a species of palm native to the dry regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and a tall, slender trunk that often develops a fibrous sheath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange or red fruits, which are edible but not widely consumed. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Butia lallemantii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and resilience."
