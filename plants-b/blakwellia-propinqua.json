    "intro": "Blakwellia propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock-heath, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. Blakwellia propinqua is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
