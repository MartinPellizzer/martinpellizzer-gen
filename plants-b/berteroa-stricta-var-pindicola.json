    "intro": "Berteroa stricta var. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
