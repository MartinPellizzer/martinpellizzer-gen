It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a long, slender spike bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.
