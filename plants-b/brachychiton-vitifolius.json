    "intro": "Brachychiton vitifolius, commonly known as the grapevine flame tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is known for its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in the region. The plant's unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a notable ornamental species in horticulture."
