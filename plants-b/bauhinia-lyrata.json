    "intro": "Bauhinia lyrata, commonly known as the lyrewood or lyre tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which are bipinnately compound and often have a striking blue or purple tinge. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Bauhinia lyrata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
