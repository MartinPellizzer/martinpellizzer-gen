    "intro": "Bupleurum rupestre, commonly known as rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a fibrous root system and slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Bupleurum rupestre is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
