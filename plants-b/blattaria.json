    "intro": "Blattaria, commonly known as cockroaches, are a diverse order of insects belonging to the class Insecta. They are characterized by their flattened, segmented bodies, long antennae, and six jointed legs. Most species possess a pair of wings, though some are flightless, and they are typically nocturnal. Blattaria play a role in ecosystems as decomposers, breaking down organic matter. Their exoskeletons are made of chitin, providing protection and structural support."
