    "intro": "Betula lenta f. lenta, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant, wintergreen-like scent when shaved. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Sweet birch is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is valued for its ornamental and historical uses."
