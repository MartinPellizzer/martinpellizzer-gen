    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 lapeyrousei, commonly known as the hybrid begonia, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia pavonii. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with contrasting patterns. It thrives in well-draining soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for container gardening and shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season."
