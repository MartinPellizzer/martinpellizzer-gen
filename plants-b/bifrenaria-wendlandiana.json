    "intro": "Bifrenaria wendlandiana, commonly known as the Wendland's bifrenaria, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
