It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in diameter. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a showy, modified leaf called a spathe.
