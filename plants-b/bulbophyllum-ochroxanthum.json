    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ochroxanthum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal dry periods. The flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the warm months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
