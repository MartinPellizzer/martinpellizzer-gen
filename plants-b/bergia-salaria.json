    "intro": "Bergia salaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and distinctive, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Bergia salaria is an evergreen perennial that produces small, showy blooms from spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and a popular choice for maritime gardens."
