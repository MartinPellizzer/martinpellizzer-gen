    "intro": "Bridelia collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bridelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by orange or red capsules containing seeds. Bridelia collina is typically found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, and it has adapted to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
