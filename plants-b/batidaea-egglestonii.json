    "intro": "Batidaea egglestonii, commonly known as the Eggleston's batidaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, mat-like growth form. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild aromatic scent, while its flowers are pale green to yellowish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
