    "intro": "Bolusanthus speciosus f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered bolusanthus, is a rare variant of the Bolusanthus speciosus species. It is characterized by its striking white petals, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange hues of the parent species. This plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are showy and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
