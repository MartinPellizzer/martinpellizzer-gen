    "intro": "Bulbophyllum whitei, commonly known as the White's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers are typically borne on terminal inflorescences and can vary in color from white to pink, depending on the specific variety."
