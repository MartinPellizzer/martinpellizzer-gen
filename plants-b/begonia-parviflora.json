    "intro": "Begonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Begonia parviflora is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
