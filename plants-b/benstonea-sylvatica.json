    "intro": "Benstonea sylvatica, commonly known as the forest benstonea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate forests of East Asia. It belongs to the family Benstoneaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the bases of trees or in undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and have a slightly waxy texture, while its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Benstonea sylvatica is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
