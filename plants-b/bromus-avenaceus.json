    "intro": "Bromus avenaceus, commonly known as the soft brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-rowed spikelets. Bromus avenaceus is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
