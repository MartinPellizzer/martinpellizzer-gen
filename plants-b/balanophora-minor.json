    "intro": "Balanophora minor, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its secretive growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and difficult to study in the wild. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
