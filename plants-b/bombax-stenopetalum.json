    "intro": "Bombax stenopetalum, commonly known as the African cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a hairy pod, which aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and corky, providing resistance to pests and drought. The plant is also valued for its fibrous inner bark, which has been traditionally used for making ropes and textiles."
