    "intro": "Balanophora thorelii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is typically found growing on the branches of trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small, white, and often have a subtle fragrance, making it a unique addition to its ecosystem. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Balanophora thorelii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
