    "intro": "Behenantha litoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Behenantha litoralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
