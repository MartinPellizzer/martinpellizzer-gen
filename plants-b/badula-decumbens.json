    "intro": "Badula decumbens, commonly known as the creeping badula, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or damp meadows."
