    "intro": "Baobabus, commonly known as the \"tree of life,\" are iconic trees found primarily in Africa. They are characterized by their massive, bulbous trunks that store large amounts of water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. These trees can grow up to 25 meters tall and have a unique, umbrella-like canopy that provides shade. Their bark is thick and fibrous, and they produce white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. Baobabus also have a long lifespan, with some individuals living for over 1,000 years."
