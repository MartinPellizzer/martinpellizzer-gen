    "intro": "Bromus giganteus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Due to its low water requirements, it is considered a drought-tolerant species adapted to arid environments."
