    "intro": "Bryonia cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved bryony, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its yellow flowers are followed by orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. Bryonia cordifolia is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties, though its sap and berries are toxic to humans and animals."
