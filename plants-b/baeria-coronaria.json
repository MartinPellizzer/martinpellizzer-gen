    "intro": "Baeria coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soils and makes it highly invasive in many regions. It is often used for erosion control due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, its aggressive growth can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns."
