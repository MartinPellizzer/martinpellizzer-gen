    "intro": "Bombax marginatum f. argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine cotton tree, is a rare and unique variant of the cotton tree native to South America. This plant is characterized by its striking white, fluffy flowers that resemble cotton, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a reddish tint when young. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
