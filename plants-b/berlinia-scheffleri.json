    "intro": "Berlinia scheffleri, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
