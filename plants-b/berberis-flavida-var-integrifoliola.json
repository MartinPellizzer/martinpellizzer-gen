It features upright, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green with a yellowish underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
