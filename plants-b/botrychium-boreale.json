    "intro": "Botrychium boreale, commonly known as the northern moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, club-shaped sporangium at the tip of a single, unbranched fertile stalk. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are simple and elongated, with a distinct base that often forms a sheath around the stem. Botrychium boreale is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and parts of Europe."
