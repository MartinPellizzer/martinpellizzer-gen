    "intro": "Brachyscome, commonly known as the \"daisy bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Brachyscome species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they often grow in a compact, bushy form. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Many species are also used in native gardens and as cut flowers due to their long-lasting blooms."
