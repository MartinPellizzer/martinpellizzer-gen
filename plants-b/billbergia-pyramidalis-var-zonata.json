    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidalis var. zonata, commonly known as the Zonate Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, arching leaves that form a rosette, with a central spathaceous inflorescence that bears showy, long-lasting flowers. The plant features vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often contrasting with its green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in tropical landscapes and as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and resilience."
