    "intro": "Brunsvigia multiflora, commonly known as the African snowball, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a tall, slender stem topped with a dense cluster of white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plant produces a large, fleshy bulb that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, appearing after the flowering period. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
