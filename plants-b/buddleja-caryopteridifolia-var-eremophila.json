    "intro": "Buddleja caryopteridifolia var. eremophila, commonly known as the Desert Buddleja, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
