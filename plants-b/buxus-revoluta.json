    "intro": "Buxus revoluta, commonly known as the silver-leaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, glossy dark green leaves that are slightly revolute, or curled under. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and topiary. Its ornamental value lies in its fine texture and ability to maintain shape with regular pruning."
