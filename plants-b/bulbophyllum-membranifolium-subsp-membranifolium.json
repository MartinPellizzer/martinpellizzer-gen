    "intro": "Bulbophyllum membranifolium subsp. membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous leaf orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its unique, membranous leaves that are often translucent or semi-transparent. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland to montane forest areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
