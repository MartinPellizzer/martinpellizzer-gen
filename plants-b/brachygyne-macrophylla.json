    "intro": "Brachygyne macrophylla, commonly known as the giant rock fig, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Brachygyne macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique foliage and ability to withstand salt spray make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
