    "intro": "Barleria umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
