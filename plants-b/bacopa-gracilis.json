    "intro": "Bacopa gracilis, commonly known as the water bead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Bacopa gracilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardening."
