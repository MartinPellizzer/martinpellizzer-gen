It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
