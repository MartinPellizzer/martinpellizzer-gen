    "intro": "Begonia retusa, commonly known as the smooth begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, which is often more showy than its flowers."
