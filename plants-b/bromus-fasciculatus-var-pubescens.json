    "intro": "Bromus fasciculatus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy (pubescent) leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces spikelets that are often clustered in fascicles, a feature common in the genus Bromus. This grass is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
