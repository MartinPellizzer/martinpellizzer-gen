    "intro": "Batrachium pseudofluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Batrachium pseudofluitans is known for its ability to float due to the air-filled bladders that provide buoyancy."
