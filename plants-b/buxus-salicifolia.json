    "intro": "Buxus salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a soft texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it ideal for shaping and maintaining in formal garden settings."
