    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. contractus, commonly known as the contracted brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is usually less than 5 cm in length. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
