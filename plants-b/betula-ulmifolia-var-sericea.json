    "intro": "Betula ulmifolia var. sericea, commonly known as silky river birch, is a variant of the river birch tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental bark and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
