    "intro": "Bulbophyllum viridescens, commonly known as the emerald orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. It requires specific care, including high humidity and well-draining soil, to thrive. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
