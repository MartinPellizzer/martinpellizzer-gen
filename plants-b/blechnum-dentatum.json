    "intro": "Blechnum dentatum, commonly known as the serrated hakea, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often divided into sharp, tooth-like segments. The fronds are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
