    "intro": "Brachiaria isachne, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in wet or flooded soils, making it a common species in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil. Brachiaria isachne is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and support biodiversity."
