    "intro": "Benzoin aestivale var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy benzoin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months, hence its species name \"aestivale.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic benefits."
