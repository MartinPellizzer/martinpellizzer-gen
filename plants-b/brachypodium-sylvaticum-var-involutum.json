    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. involutum, commonly known as the curled brachypodium, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive involute (curled) leaf sheaths, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous slender, awned spikelets. Brachypodium sylvaticum var. involutum is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
