    "intro": "Botrychium cicutarium var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds that are deeply dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central umbel, a feature typical of the genus Botrychium. This variant is relatively rare and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
