The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Barleria farinosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
