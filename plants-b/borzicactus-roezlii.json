    "intro": "Borzicactus roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive, ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. Its spines are typically short and yellowish, providing protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments."
