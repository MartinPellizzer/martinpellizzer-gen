    "intro": "Berberis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice in horticulture."
