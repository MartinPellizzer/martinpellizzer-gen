    "intro": "Bulbophyllum foetidum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or green with red or purple markings. Its unique scent, which can be described as unpleasant or strong, is a notable characteristic. The bulbous roots and pseudobulbs are essential for its survival, storing water and nutrients in its natural habitat."
