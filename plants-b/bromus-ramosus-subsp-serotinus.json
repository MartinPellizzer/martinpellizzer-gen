    "intro": "Bromus ramosus subsp. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect culms that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The inflorescence consists of a dense panicle, with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a hairy texture, and the plant is adapted to dry, disturbed habitats. This subspecies is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
