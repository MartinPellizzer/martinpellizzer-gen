It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in some regions."
