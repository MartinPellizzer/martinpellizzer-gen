    "intro": "Braya novae-angliae var. interior, commonly known as the interior braya, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. This variety is part of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small flowers and capsule fruits."
