    "intro": "Bolbitis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical forests of Hainan Island, China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis hainanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
