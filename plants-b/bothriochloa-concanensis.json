It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
