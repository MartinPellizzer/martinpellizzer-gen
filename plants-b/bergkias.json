    "intro": "Bergkias, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically serrated and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Bergkias is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
