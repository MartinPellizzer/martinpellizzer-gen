    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dulongjiangense, commonly known as the Dulongjiang orchid, is a rare and endemic epiphytic orchid found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its high-altitude, humid environment. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
