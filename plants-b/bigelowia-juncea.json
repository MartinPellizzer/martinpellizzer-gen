    "intro": "Bigelowia juncea, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown, and it is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. Bigelowia juncea is valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for basket-making and other crafts. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
