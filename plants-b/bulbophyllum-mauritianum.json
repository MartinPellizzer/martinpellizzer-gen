    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the island of Mauritius. This epiphytic orchid possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
