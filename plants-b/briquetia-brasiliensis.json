    "intro": "Briquetia brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild."
