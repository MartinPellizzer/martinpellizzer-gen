    "intro": "Boerhavia bracteata, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Boerhavia bracteata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, often acting as a ground cover or weed in certain environments."
