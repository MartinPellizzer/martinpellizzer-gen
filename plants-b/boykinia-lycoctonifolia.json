    "intro": "Boykinia lycoctonifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
