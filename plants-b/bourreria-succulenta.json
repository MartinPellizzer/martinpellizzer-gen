    "intro": "Bourreria succulenta, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it store water in its native dry environment. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bourreria succulenta is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along stream banks."
