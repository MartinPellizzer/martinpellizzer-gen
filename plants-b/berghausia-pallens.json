    "intro": "Berghausia pallens, commonly known as the pale berghausia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Berghausia pallens is considered a rare and endemic species."
