    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidalis var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that features both red and yellow hues, making it highly ornamental. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage composed of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in both indoor and outdoor gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
