    "intro": "Blaeria breviflora var. aberdarica, commonly known as the Aberdaric Blaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Aberdaric Mountains. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
