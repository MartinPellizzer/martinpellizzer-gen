    "intro": "Boswellia socotrana subsp. aspleniifolia, commonly known as Socotra's fern-like frankincense tree, is a unique species native to the Arabian Peninsula and the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are alternate and pinnately compound, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces aromatic resin, known as frankincense, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and religious rituals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to rocky and limestone soils. Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
