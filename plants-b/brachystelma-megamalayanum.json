    "intro": "Brachystelma megamalayanum, commonly known as the Malayan star cactus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact, branching structure with fleshy stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
