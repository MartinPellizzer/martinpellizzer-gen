    "intro": "Brassica rupestris subsp. hispida, commonly known as the hairy rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in loose, rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
