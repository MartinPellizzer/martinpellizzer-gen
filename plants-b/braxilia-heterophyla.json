    "intro": "Braxilia heterophyla, commonly known as the Brazilian star fern, is a unique species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and emit a subtle fragrance when touched. Braxilia heterophyla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
