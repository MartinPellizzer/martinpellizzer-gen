    "intro": "Bulbophyllum galactanthum, commonly known as the Milky Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and striking white flowers with a soft, milky appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. The orchid's flowers are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
