It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Baderoa typically blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
