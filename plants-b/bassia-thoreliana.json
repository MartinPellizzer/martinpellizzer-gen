    "intro": "Bassia thoreliana, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. Bassia thoreliana is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
