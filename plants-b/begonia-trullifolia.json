    "intro": "Begonia trullifolia, commonly known as the pink begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting green or red calyx. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia trullifolia is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
