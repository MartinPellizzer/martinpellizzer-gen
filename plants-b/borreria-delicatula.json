    "intro": "Borreria delicatula, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with woody stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers, which open at night, are pale white to pink and emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Borreria delicatula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
