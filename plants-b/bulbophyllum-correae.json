    "intro": "Bulbophyllum correae, commonly known as the Correa's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in drier conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted for efficient water retention. The flowers, which bloom in spring, come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
