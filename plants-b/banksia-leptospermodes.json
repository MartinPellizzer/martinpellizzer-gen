    "intro": "Banksia leptospermodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical or conical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, a feature common among the Proteaceae family. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Banksia leptospermodes plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
