    "intro": "Bufonia mauritanica var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petioled desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for local wildlife."
