    "intro": "Betula andreji, commonly known as the Andreji birch, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in its dispersal."
