    "intro": "Brassica oleracea stirps bullata, commonly known as the Brussels sprout, is a cultivar of the wild cabbage species. It is characterized by its compact, leafy structure and small, cabbage-like buds that form along the stem. These buds are typically harvested when they reach a diameter of about 1 to 2 centimeters. The plant is a biennial, though it is often grown as an annual in temperate climates. It thrives in cool weather and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
