    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. madritensis, commonly known as the Spanish needle, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
