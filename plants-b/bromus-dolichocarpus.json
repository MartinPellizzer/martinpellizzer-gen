    "intro": "Bromus dolichocarpus, commonly known as the long-fruit brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated spikelets that contain the distinctive, elongated lemma. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus dolichocarpus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
