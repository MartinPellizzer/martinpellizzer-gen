    "intro": "Bulbophyllum layae, commonly known as the Lay's Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
