    "intro": "Betonica nivea subsp. nivea, commonly known as the alpine betony, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Betonica nivea subsp. nivea is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
