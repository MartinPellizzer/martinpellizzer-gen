    "intro": "Boenninghausenia albiflora var. brevipes, commonly known as the white-flowered boenninghausenia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
