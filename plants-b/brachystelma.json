    "intro": "Brachystelma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, often ribbed stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are typically found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Brachystelma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions. The flowers are usually nocturnal, opening in the evening and closing by dawn."
