    "intro": "Budawangia, commonly known as the ancient cycad, is a genus of plants that belongs to the family Cycadaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, feather-like leaves. Budawangia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. They are gymnosperms, meaning they reproduce through seeds rather than flowers, and they have a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era. Due to their unique morphology and ecological significance, Budawangia plants are of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
