It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth, glabrous surface, giving it its specific variety name. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
