    "intro": "Bidens crithmifolia, commonly known as the sea lettuce or coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. Bidens crithmifolia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion through its extensive root system."
