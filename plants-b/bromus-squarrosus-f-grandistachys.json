    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus f. grandistachys, commonly known as the giant tawny grass, is a variant of the tawny grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its distinctive, long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike that is often more elongated than the typical form of the species. Its botanical features make it well-suited for dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This form is often studied for its ecological role and its potential use in restoration projects."
