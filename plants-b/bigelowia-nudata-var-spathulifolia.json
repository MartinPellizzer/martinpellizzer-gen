    "intro": "Bigelowia nudata var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed bigelowia, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, often succulent leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving them a soft texture. This variety is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
