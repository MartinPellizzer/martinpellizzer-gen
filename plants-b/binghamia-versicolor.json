    "intro": "Binghamia versicolor, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Binghamia versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in coastal areas."
