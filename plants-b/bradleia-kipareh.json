It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting patterns.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
