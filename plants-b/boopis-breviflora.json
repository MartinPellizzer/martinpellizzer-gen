    "intro": "Boopis breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered boopis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Boopis breviflora is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in low-water conditions."
