    "intro": "Binghamia olowinskiana, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its unique appearance and adaptability to humid, shaded environments make it a distinctive feature of its habitat. Binghamia olowinskiana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
