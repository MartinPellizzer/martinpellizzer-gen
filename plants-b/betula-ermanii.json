    "intro": "Betula ermanii, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula ermanii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across its native range."
