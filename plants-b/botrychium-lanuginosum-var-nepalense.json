    "intro": "Botrychium lanuginosum var. nepalense, commonly known as the Nepalese moonwort, is a fern-like spore plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally arranged, fiddlehead-like fronds that resemble a cluster of small, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sorus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is native to regions of Asia, including Nepal, and is often found in temperate climates with high humidity."
