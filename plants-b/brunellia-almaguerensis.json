    "intro": "Brunellia almaguerensis, commonly known as the Almaguero waxtree, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid lowland forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
