    "intro": "Bulbophyllum expallidum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in conservation efforts."
