    "intro": "Bahia lanata, commonly known as silky bahia, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage that is covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Bahia lanata is also valued for its ability to withstand heavy foot traffic, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control."
