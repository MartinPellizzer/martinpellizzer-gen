    "intro": "Billardiera nesophila, commonly known as the silver-leafed billardiera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Billardiera nesophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
