    "intro": "Bupleurum nigrocarpum, commonly known as black-fruited bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark, spherical fruits that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas. Bupleurum nigrocarpum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported tonic and anti-inflammatory properties."
