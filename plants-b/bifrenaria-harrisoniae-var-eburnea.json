    "intro": "Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. eburnea, commonly known as the golden bamboo orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its pseudobulbs forming a compact, upright structure. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
