    "intro": "Betula mandshurica var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatskan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system and a tendency to form dense stands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in boreal and subarctic ecosystems."
