    "intro": "Brachypodium rupestre f. scholzii, commonly known as the rock bristlegrass, is a compact, mat-forming perennial grass native to rocky habitats in southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a dense, tufted growth habit, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in tight, cylindrical clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, making it a hardy species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance. The foliage and inflorescence are typically gray-green to silver-blue, adding ornamental value to rocky landscapes."
