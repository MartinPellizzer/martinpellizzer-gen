    "intro": "Bauhinia crocea, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, pink to red flowers that resemble flames, which appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bauhinia crocea is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
