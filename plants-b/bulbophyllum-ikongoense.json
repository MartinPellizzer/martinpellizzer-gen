    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ikongoense, commonly known as the Ikongo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in the humid, tropical environments where it thrives. The flowers often display a striking combination of colors, including shades of pink, white, and yellow."
