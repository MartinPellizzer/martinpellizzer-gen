It produces striking, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal climates. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. This species is valued in horticulture for its unique floral display and adaptability to various growing conditions."
