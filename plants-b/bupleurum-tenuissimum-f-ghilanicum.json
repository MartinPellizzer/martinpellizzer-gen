    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum f. ghilanicum, commonly known as the Ghilani's narrowleaf bupleurum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Caucasus. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
