It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
