    "intro": "Bassia elliptica, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering the ground in desert environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Bassia elliptica is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh climates."
