It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that can reach significant lengths, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife."
