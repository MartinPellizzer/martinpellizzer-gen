It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in association with other endemic flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
