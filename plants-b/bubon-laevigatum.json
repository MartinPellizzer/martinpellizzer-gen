    "intro": "Bubon laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth bubon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
