    "intro": "Bulbophyllum peltopus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a few showy, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, which is typical for many epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. Bulbophyllum peltopus is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
