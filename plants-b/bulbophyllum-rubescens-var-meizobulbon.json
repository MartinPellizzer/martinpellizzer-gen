    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rubescens var. meizobulbon, commonly known as the red-flowered bulbophyllum, is a striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a unique, elongated pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual impact to its natural habitat. The variety meizobulbon is distinguished by its more intense coloration and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the standard species."
