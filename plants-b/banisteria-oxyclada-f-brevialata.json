    "intro": "Banisteria oxyclada f. brevialata, commonly known as the dwarf banisteria, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to container gardening. Due to its slow growth and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for shaded garden spaces."
