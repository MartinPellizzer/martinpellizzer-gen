    "intro": "Bombax campestre, commonly known as the cotton tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a large, woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. The plant is adapted to warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland areas near rivers or in dense forests."
