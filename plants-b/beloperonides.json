    "intro": "Beloperonides, commonly known as the \"flower of the moon,\" is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, night-blooming flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered fruits that contain seeds with a unique, waxy coating. Beloperonides is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies for respiratory ailments. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered an endangered species."
