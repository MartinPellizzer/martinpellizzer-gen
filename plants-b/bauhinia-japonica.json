    "intro": "Bauhinia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a flat, leathery pod that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia japonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
