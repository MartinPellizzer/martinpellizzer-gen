    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. appendiculatum, commonly known as the Cape shield fern, is a perennial fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, curled margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fertile fronds. This variant is often distinguished by its shorter, more compact fronds compared to the typical form of Blechnum capense."
