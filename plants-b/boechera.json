    "intro": "Boechera, commonly known as rockcress, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). These plants are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to purple. Boechera species are often perennial and have a low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are usually spoon-shaped. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
