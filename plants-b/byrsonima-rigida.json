    "intro": "Byrsonima rigida, commonly known as the rigid wax tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by local communities. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. The plant has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
