    "intro": "Bromus tectorum subsp. lucidus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions."
