    "intro": "Bignonia mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
