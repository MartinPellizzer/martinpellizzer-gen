    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium f. rhombeum, commonly known as the rhomboid fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is notable for its intricate, lace-like foliage that forms a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus, which are often found on the underside of the fronds. This fern is a perennial plant that exhibits a unique reproductive strategy through spore dispersal."
