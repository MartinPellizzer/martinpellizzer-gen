    "intro": "Blechnum venosum, commonly known as the veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often dark green with a prominent midrib and veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum venosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush foliage."
