    "intro": "Borreria multiflora, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Borreria multiflora produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
