    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum f. typicum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a small, inconspicuous spore-producing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Botrychium obliquum f. typicum is typically found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada."
