    "intro": "Berchemia, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their thick, bottle-shaped trunks that store water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and the flowers are often yellow or orange, clustered in racemes. Berchemia species are valued for their ornamental value and are commonly cultivated in gardens due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance. Some species are also used in traditional medicine."
