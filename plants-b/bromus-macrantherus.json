    "intro": "Bromus macrantherus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus macrantherus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
