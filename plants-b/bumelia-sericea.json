It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a soft, fuzzy texture. Bumelia sericea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
