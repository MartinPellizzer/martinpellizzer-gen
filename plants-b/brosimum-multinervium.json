    "intro": "Brosimum multinervium, commonly known as the Guayacan tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name \"multinervium.\" It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Brosimum multinervium is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
