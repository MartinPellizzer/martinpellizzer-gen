    "intro": "Botryarrhena venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan starfruit tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are less commonly consumed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for horticultural purposes."
