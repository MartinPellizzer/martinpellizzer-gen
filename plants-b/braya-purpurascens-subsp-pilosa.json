    "intro": "Braya purpurascens subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the purple-bracted silky sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The subspecies pilosa is distinguished by its soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
