    "intro": "Baccharis rufescens var. rufescens, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant has gray-green, rough-textured leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
