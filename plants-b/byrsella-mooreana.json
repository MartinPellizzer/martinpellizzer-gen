    "intro": "Byrsella mooreana, commonly known as the Moore's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to freshwater habitats in southern Africa, particularly in regions with still or slow-moving water. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter and are attached to slender, branching stems. Byrsella mooreana is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
