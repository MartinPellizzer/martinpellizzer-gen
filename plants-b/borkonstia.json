    "intro": "Borkonstia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes a compact growth habit and a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in rocky substrates. Borkonstia is a popular choice for botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
