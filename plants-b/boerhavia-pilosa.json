    "intro": "Boerhavia pilosa, commonly known as sand mat or hairy bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial that features small, pink to purple flowers and is adapted to thrive in sandy soils. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating, further aiding in water conservation. Boerhavia pilosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
