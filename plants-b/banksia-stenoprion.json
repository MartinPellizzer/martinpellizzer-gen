    "intro": "Banksia stenoprion, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical inflorescences that produce yellow or orange flowers. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family and is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Banksia stenoprion typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its nectar-rich flowers provide an important food source for native pollinators such as honeyeaters and birds."
