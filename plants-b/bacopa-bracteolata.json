    "intro": "Bacopa bracteolata, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported cognitive and calming effects. Bacopa bracteolata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
