    "intro": "Begonia aceroides, commonly known as the mapleleaf begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia aceroides is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
