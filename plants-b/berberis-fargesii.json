    "intro": "Berberis fargesii, commonly known as the Farges barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features prickly, spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the stems remain visible even after the leaves fall."
