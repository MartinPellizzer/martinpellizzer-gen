    "intro": "Baccharis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a valuable plant for wildlife, providing nectar for insects and birds. It is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
