    "intro": "Bacopa grandiflora, commonly known as the large-leaved water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in aquatic environments, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
