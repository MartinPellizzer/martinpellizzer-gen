    "intro": "Brassica rupestris subsp. villosa, commonly known as the woolly wallflower, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies villosa is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
