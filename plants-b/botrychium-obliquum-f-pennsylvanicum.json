    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum f. pennsylvanicum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that resemble a moon or crescent shape. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a single row along the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a relic species with limited distribution in North America."
