    "intro": "Bambusa maculosa, commonly known as the spotted bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, slender culms with a distinctive purplish-brown stripe running down the length of each stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth, waxy surface. Bambusa maculosa is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
