    "intro": "Brassica recurvata, commonly known as the curled mustard, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that curl inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Brassica recurvata is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
