    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chloroglossum, commonly known as the golden-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral lips, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its flowers are typically small to medium in size and bloom during the warmer months. The orchid thrives in shaded, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
