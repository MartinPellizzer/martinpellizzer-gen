    "intro": "Bromus salangensis, commonly known as Salang hillbilly grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with long, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus salangensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
