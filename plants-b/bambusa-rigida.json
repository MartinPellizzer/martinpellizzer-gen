    "intro": "Bambusa rigida, commonly known as the stiff bamboo, is a tall, slender grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rigid, upright culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Bambusa rigida is a clump-forming species, producing new shoots from its rhizomes. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in construction and crafts in its native regions."
