    "intro": "Billbergia minarum, commonly known as the glasshouse billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble small flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia minarum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
