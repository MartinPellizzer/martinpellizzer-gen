It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
