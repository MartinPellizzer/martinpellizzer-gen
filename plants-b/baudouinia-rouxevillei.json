    "intro": "Baudouinia rouxevillei, commonly known as the Rouxeville's boerma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
