    "intro": "Boehmeriopsis pallida, commonly known as the white fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a soft, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters during the summer months. Boehmeriopsis pallida plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic insects and invertebrates."
