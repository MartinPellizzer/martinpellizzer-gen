    "intro": "Bromus psammophilus, commonly known as the sandy bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to sandy soils with poor nutrient content. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. Bromus psammophilus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
