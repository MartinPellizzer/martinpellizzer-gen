    "intro": "Berberis lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
