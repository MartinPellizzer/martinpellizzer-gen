    "intro": "Breviglandium, commonly known as the small-lobed bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in their nutrient absorption. Breviglandium species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They have delicate, leafy stems with whorled leaves that often bear small, specialized bladders. The genus is notable for its carnivorous adaptations, which complement its photosynthetic capabilities in nutrient-poor environments."
