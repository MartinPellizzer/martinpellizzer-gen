    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. hirtus, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other bromus species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. The leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its overall rugged appearance."
