    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rhopaloblepharon, commonly known as the \"Lizard's Tail Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or brown markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by experienced orchid growers."
