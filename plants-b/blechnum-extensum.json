It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often segmented fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and are often covered in small, scale-like structures. Blechnum extensum is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
