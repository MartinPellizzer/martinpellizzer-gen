    "intro": "Blephilia, commonly known as woolly blue curls, is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. These perennial herbs are native to North America and are characterized by their soft, hairy leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Blephilia species are noted for their ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade and are popular in native plant gardens. Their flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
