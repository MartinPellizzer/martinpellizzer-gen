    "intro": "Bilabrella lutaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is classified as endangered."
