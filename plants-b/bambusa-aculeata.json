    "intro": "Bambusa aculeata, commonly known as the thorny bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, woody culms that are often covered with sharp, spiky projections. The plant typically grows in dense clumps and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a bluish-green color and a hairy underside. Bambusa aculeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in construction and as a source of fiber."
