    "intro": "Buxus balearica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Balearic Islands. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant has a rounded shape and produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat form make it a popular choice for topiary and hedging."
