    "intro": "Botryoropis, commonly known as the false truffle, is a type of fungal fruiting body that resembles a truffle in appearance. It belongs to the family Tulasnellaceae and is primarily found in association with certain species of fungi, particularly those in the genus Lepiota. The structure of Botryoropis consists of a dense, spongy mass with a rough, irregular surface that can vary in color from white to brown. It is typically found in forested areas where its host fungi are present, often decomposing organic matter in the soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Botryoropis is of interest to mycologists studying fungal symbiosis and decomposition processes."
