    "intro": "Barleria fulvostellata subsp. scariosa, commonly known as the scaly barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a distinctive whitish or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
