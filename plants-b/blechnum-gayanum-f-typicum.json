    "intro": "Blechnum gayanum f. typicum, commonly known as the Gaya fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often covered in a layer of fine, silky hair, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
