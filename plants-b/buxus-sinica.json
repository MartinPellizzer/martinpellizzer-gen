    "intro": "Buxus sinica, commonly known as Chinese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant typically produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for hedges and topiary. Buxus sinica is valued for its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat shape with regular pruning."
