It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces yellowish-white or orange berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Bursera rupicola thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its aromatic resins have been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes."
