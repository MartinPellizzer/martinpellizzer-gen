    "intro": "Bribria oraria, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Bribria oraria plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
