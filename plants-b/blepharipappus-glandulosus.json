    "intro": "Blepharipappus glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, glandular-stipitate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and it produces a pappus of bristles for wind dispersal of its seeds. The glandular structures on its leaves may serve to deter herbivores or reduce water loss."
