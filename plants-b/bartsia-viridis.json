    "intro": "Bartsia viridis, commonly known as the green bartsia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Bartsia viridis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
