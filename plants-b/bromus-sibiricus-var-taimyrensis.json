It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as tundra and grasslands. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
