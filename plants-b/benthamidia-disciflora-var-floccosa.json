    "intro": "Benthamidia disciflora var. floccosa, commonly known as the fluffcap lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its soft, woolly thallus that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It typically grows on rock surfaces in temperate regions, forming dense, cushion-like growths. The lobed, pale to greyish-green lobes are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which contributes to its unique texture. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, humid environments. It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for certain invertebrates."
