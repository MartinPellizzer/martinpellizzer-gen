    "intro": "Bromus cernuus, commonly known as the bentgrass or nodding brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often nodding inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, three-angled spikelets. Bromus cernuus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
