It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking pinkish-purple flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy bulbs that serve as storage organs for nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer or early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
