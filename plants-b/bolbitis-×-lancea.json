    "intro": "Bolbitis \u00d7 lancea, commonly known as the lance-leaf fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent plants, Bolbitis heterophylla and Bolbitis heudelotii. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis \u00d7 lancea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
