    "intro": "Brachystegia filiformis, commonly known as the slender brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
