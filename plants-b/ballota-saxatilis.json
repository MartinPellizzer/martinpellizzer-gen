It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Ballota saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
