    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent browntop, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
