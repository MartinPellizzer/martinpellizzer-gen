    "intro": "Billbergia liboniana, commonly known as the red-bellied spider plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with red or orange markings on the inner surfaces. The plant produces striking inflorescences that consist of vibrant orange or red flowers emerging from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia liboniana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
