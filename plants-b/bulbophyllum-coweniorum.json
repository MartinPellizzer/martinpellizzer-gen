    "intro": "Bulbophyllum coweniorum, commonly known as the Cowen's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its rocky habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
