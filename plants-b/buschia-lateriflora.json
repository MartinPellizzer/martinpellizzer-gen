    "intro": "Buschia lateriflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved buschia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil. Buschia lateriflora is often found growing near streams or in shaded understory habitats."
