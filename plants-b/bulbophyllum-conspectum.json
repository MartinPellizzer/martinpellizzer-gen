    "intro": "Bulbophyllum conspectum, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
