    "intro": "Batatas maritima, commonly known as sea potato, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots that grow in sandy or muddy soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale pink or white flowers. Its tubers are edible and have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for food. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its specific environmental requirements."
