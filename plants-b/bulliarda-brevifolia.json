    "intro": "Bulliarda brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulliard, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Bulliarda brevifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Ericaceae family."
