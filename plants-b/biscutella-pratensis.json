    "intro": "Biscutella pratensis, commonly known as the meadow biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching a height of about 20 to 50 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are arranged in a raceme and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Biscutella pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
