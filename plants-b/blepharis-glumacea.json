    "intro": "Blepharis glumacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions."
