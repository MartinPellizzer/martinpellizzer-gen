    "intro": "Bromus trinii, commonly known as the three-awn brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and inflorescences composed of spikelets with three awns, giving it its common name. It is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in diverse ecological communities. Bromus trinii is generally not considered invasive and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various organisms."
