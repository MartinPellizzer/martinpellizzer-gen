    "intro": "Bellardiochloa aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical and ecological study. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
