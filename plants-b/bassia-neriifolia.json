    "intro": "Bassia neriifolia, commonly known as blackleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features silver-gray foliage with small, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, fluffy inflorescences, often appearing in shades of pink to purple. Bassia neriifolia is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
