    "intro": "Brasolia flava, commonly known as the golden bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage and clustered inflorescence. The plant features a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers, which are typically short-lived, are often surrounded by colorful bracts that enhance its ornamental value. Brasolia flava thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
