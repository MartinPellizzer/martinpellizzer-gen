    "intro": "Brockmania, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often strikingly colored flowers that are adapted to thrive in rocky or alpine environments. Brockmania species typically have tall, slender stems with clusters of small, intricate blooms that bloom in late summer or early autumn. They are native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they grow in high-altitude, sunny conditions. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Brockmania species are rare and face threats from habitat loss and climate change."
