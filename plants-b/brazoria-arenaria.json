    "intro": "Brazoria arenaria, commonly known as the sand sparrowgrass, is a small, annual plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and beach environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
