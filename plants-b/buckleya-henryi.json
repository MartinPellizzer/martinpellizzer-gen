    "intro": "Buckleya henryi, commonly known as the Chinese buckler-ferns, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buckleya henryi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
