    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate mouse-ear fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and growth habits. It features a small, heart-shaped frond with a distinctive, spore-bearing sorus located on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and forest floors. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the fertile fronds being more developed. This fern is part of the Botrychium genus, known for its specialized reproductive structures and ecological adaptations."
