    "intro": "Borreria octodon, commonly known as the Mexican rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borreria octodon is often found growing on rocky slopes and in dry, well-drained soils."
