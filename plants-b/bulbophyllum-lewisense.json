    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lewisense, commonly known as the Lewis's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, usually in shades of yellow and green. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts."
