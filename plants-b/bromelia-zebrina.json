    "intro": "Bromelia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically green with distinctive white or yellow stripes, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
