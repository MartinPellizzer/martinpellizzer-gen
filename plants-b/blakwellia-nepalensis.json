It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves with a velvety texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
