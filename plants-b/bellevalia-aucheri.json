    "intro": "Bellevalia aucheri, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, violet-blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though caution is needed due to its poisonous nature."
