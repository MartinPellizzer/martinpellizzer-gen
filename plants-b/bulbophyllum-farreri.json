It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often pale yellow to greenish-white, with dark purple or brown markings."
