    "intro": "Bowlesia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's bowlesia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bowlesia mandonii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
