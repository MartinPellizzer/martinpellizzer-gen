    "intro": "Banisteria whitei, commonly known as the white banisteria, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread across supports. Banisteria whitei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
