    "intro": "Blechnum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of evergreen ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate in structure. They are native to various regions across the globe, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and thrive in moist, shaded environments. Blechnum species are known for their ability to tolerate a range of soil types and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
