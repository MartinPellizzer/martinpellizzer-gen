    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. macrostrobila, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins, with the female inflorescences being notably larger than the male ones, a trait that defines the varietal name *macrostrobila*. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin, papery layers. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
