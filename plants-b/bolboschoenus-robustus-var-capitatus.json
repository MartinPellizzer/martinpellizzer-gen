    "intro": "Bolboschoenus robustus var. capitatus, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems. It plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
