    "intro": "Bromus confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus confinis thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
