    "intro": "Betula populifolia f. incisifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves. This deciduous tree is native to the western United States, particularly in mountainous regions. Its bark is typically white and peels in thin, papery layers, a feature common to many birch species. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates."
