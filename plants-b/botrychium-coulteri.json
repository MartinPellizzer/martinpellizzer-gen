    "intro": "Botrychium coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on specialized leaves called sporophylls, which are clustered in a distinctive, spore-bearing structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Botrychium coulteri is a rare and endangered species, with a limited distribution in the southwestern United States."
