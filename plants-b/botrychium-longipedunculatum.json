    "intro": "Botrychium longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, upright fertile frond with a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually small and lance-shaped, with a distinct, elongated peduncle supporting the sorus. Botrychium longipedunculatum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and delicate species."
