    "intro": "Betula ermanii f. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese birch, is a compact, ornamental variant of the Japanese white birch. It is characterized by its slow growth, dense foliage, and small, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive, upright appearance. The tree produces catkins that are shorter than those of the typical species, contributing to its unique aesthetic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add a refined, woodland look to landscapes."
