    "intro": "Brachypeza unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathland environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to dry and nutrient-poor conditions."
