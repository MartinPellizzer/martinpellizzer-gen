    "intro": "Blumea commersonii, commonly known as the mountain blumea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters, are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Blumea commersonii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
