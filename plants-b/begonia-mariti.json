    "intro": "Begonia mariti, commonly known as the coastal begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal gardening."
