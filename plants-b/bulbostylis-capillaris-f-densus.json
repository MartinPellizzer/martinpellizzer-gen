It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of tiny, spike-like flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its dense arrangement of flowering structures, which sets it apart from other forms of Bulbostylis."
