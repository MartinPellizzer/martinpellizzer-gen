    "intro": "Begonia renifolia, commonly known as the kidney-leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
