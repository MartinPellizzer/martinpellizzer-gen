    "intro": "Benthamia nivea subsp. nivea, commonly known as the white benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb with compact, cushion-like growth habit, typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally glaucous, covered in a whitish coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
