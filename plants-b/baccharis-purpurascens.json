    "intro": "Baccharis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, purple-tinged flower heads that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Baccharis purpurascens plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators like bees and butterflies."
