    "intro": "Bletia roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture in its growing habitat. Bletia roezlii is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
