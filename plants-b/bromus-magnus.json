    "intro": "Bromus magnus, commonly known as the giant brome, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and its dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, open habitats. Bromus magnus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
