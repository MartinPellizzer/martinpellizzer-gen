    "intro": "Berberis angulosa, commonly known as the angular barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal medicine."
