    "intro": "Byttneria bernieri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
