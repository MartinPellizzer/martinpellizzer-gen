    "intro": "Bromelia ananas, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a rosette of long, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water. Its flowers are typically hidden within the leaf rosette, and the plant produces a spiky, edible fruit known as the pineapple. The botanical structure of Bromelia ananas is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
