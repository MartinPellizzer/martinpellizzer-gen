    "intro": "Billbergia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked leaf billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
