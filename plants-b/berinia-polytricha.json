    "intro": "Berinia polytricha, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and clustered in dense inflorescences. Berinia polytricha is adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats, relying on its prey for essential nutrients."
