    "intro": "Banksia punicea, commonly known as the red banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and sandy areas. Banksia punicea plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native wildlife."
