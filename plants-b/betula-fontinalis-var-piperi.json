    "intro": "Betula fontinalis var. piperi, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark that peels in vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. The yellow birch is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
