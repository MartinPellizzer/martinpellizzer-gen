    "intro": "Barleriacanthus noctiflora, commonly known as the night-flowering barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub with slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually deep violet or purple, with a strong, sweet fragrance that becomes more intense during the evening. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks."
