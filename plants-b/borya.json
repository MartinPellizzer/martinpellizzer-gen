    "intro": "Borya, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic environments, where they thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Borya species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to purple, and their low-growing, mat-forming habit. They have adapted to extreme climates through thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. The genus includes several species, such as Borya alpina and Borya tibetana, which are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological resilience."
