    "intro": "Betula kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz birch, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree has small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces catkins as its primary means of reproduction. Betula kirghisorum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
