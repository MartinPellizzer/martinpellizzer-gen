It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by green, spiny fruits. It is native to the Western Ghats of India and thrives in moist, tropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and used mainly in traditional medicine."
