    "intro": "Brassica scopulorum var. spinescens, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to low-maintenance gardens."
