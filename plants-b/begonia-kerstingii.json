    "intro": "Begonia kerstingii, commonly known as the Kersting's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that range in color from dark green to almost black. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
