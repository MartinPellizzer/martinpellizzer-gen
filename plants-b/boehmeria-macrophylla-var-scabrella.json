    "intro": "Boehmeria macrophylla var. scabrella, commonly known as the rough-leafed flax, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch due to their dense pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its fibers are used in traditional crafts and textiles, making it an economically important species in some regions."
