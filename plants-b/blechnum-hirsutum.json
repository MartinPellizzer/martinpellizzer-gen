    "intro": "Blechnum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are usually clustered in compact, shield-like formations."
