    "intro": "Biophytum thorelianum var. sinense, commonly known as the Chinese firecracker plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to China. It is a herbaceous perennial that features bright red, papery bracts resembling firecrackers, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
