    "intro": "Brachyscias, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically palmate, with three to five lobes, and the bark is often rough and fissured. Brachyscias are deciduous, shedding their leaves during the cooler months, and they thrive in full sun with well-drained soil. They are popular ornamental plants due to their vibrant floral displays and adaptability to various climates."
