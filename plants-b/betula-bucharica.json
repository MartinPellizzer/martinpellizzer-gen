    "intro": "Betula bucharica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
