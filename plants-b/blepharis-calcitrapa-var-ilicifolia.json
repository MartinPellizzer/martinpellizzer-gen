The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, and it produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures. This variety is part of the Plantaginaceae family and is often found in coastal scrub and dune habitats."
