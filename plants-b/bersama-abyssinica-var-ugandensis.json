    "intro": "Bersama abyssinica var. ugandensis, commonly known as the Ugandan ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the highlands of Uganda. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, rugged bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable but seldom cultivated species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
