    "intro": "Balsamea mulelame, commonly known as the stickyleaf plant, is a member of the family Myrtaceae and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that secrete a viscous, resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense branching structure that allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The resinous sap has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for medicinal and adhesive purposes."
