It features rosettes of sword-like, blue-green leaves that are stiff and fibrous, giving it a distinctive, architectural appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
