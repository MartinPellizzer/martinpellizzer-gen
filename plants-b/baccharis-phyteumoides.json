    "intro": "Baccharis phyteumoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
