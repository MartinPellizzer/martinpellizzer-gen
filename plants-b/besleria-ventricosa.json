    "intro": "Besleria ventricosa, commonly known as the orange-leaf begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking coloration and compact growth habit. Besleria ventricosa prefers partial shade and consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds and indoor cultivation."
