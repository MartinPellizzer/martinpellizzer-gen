    "intro": "Berberis everestiana var. ventosa, commonly known as the Himalayan barberry, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features thick, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
