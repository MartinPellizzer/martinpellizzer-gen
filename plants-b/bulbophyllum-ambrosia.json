It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique inflorescence and vibrant floral colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat."
