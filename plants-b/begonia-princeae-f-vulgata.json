It features velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge, and it produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets due to its trailing growth habit and ornamental foliage."
