    "intro": "Borinda frigidis, commonly known as the cold-loving shrub, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions with cold climates. It features small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or poorly drained soils. Borinda frigidis is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine areas."
