It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Blumea cernua thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources."
