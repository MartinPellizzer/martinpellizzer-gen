    "intro": "Bulbophyllum monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces a single, showy flower per stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Bulbophyllum monanthum is valued in horticulture for its unique floral display and relatively easy care requirements."
