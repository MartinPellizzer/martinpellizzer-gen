    "intro": "Bulbocastanum linnaei var. gouanii, commonly known as the Gouan's golden bulb, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small lanterns. The plant produces a bulb-like structure that serves as a storage organ for nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. This variant is particularly prized by botanists and horticulturists for its unique floral display and ecological significance."
