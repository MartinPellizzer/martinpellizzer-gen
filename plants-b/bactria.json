    "intro": "Bactria, commonly known as the Bactrian horse, is a rare and endangered species native to Central Asia. This horse is distinguished by its long, thick winter coat and the unique double row of long hairs on its neck and back. It has a stocky build and is well adapted to the harsh, cold environments of the region. The plant aspect of Bactria refers to the vegetation that thrives in the same ecological zones where these horses live. Bactria's habitat includes grasslands and mountainous regions, supporting a diverse array of flora."
