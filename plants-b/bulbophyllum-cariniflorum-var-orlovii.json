    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cariniflorum var. orlovii, commonly known as the Orlov's ridge-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, elongated flowers with prominent ridges on the petals, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. This variant is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral morphology and relatively manageable care requirements."
