    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed areas. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish-gray seeds. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This variety is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in arid and semi-arid environments."
