    "intro": "Brachiaria obvoluta, commonly known as the rolling grass or velvet brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Brachiaria obvoluta is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats. It is also valued for its use in pastureland and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
