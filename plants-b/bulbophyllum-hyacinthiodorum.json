    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hyacinthiodorum, commonly known as the hyacinth-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant, hyacinth-like flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted for moisture retention. The flower spikes typically emerge from the base of the pseudobulbs, adding to its ornamental appeal."
