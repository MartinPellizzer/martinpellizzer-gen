    "intro": "Bryodesma tortipilum, commonly known as the woolly moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central stem and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically small and clustered near the base of the plant. Bryodesma tortipilum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
