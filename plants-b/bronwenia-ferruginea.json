    "intro": "Bronwenia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to New Zealand. It features fronds that are deeply divided and covered in a rusty-colored, fuzzy texture, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows along the underside of the fronds. Bronwenia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
