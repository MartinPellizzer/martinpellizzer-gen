    "intro": "Blepharocalyx sessilifolius var. pluriflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, wax-like flowers that bloom in axillary clusters, giving it its common name. These flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and craftsmanship."
