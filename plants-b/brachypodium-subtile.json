    "intro": "Brachypodium subtile, commonly known as slender false brome, is a small, annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Brachypodium subtile is valued in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and as a model species in plant genetics research."
