    "intro": "Bidens delphiniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beggar-ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bristly seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
