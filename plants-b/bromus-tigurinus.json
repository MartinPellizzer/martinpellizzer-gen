    "intro": "Bromus tigurinus, commonly known as the Tuscan brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus tigurinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
