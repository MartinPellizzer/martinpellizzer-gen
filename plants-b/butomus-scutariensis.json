    "intro": "Butomus scutariensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Butomus scutariensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
