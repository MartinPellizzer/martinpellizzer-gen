    "intro": "Bicornella humblotiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's bicorn, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Bicornella humblotiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, it is considered an endangered species."
