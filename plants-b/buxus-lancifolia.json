    "intro": "Buxus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 1\u20132 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus lancifolia is often used in horticulture for topiary and hedging due to its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
