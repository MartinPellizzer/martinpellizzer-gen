    "intro": "Bouteloua pedicellata, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or gray in color. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of native grasslands. Blue grama is also valued for its drought tolerance and role in soil stabilization."
