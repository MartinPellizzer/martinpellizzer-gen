    "intro": "Bouteloua uniflora, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Blue grama is an important component of many grassland ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. It plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
