    "intro": "Brayopsis alpaminae var. argentea, commonly known as the silver-stemmed brayopsis, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage. It typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves covered in a fine, whitish coating that reflects sunlight. Its flowering occurs in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous greenish-white blooms. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
