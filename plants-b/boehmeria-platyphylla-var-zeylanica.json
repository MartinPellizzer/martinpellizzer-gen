It belongs to the nettle family, Urticaceae, and is characterized by its soft, silky fibers that are harvested from the stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous.
