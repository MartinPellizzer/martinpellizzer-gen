    "intro": "Betula oxycoviensis var. majuscula, commonly known as the giant birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the birch genus. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a subtle peeling texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This variant is typically found in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions where it thrives in shaded conditions."
