    "intro": "Balanophora typhina, commonly known as the Indian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide essential nutrients. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and difficult to study in the wild."
