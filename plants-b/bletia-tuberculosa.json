    "intro": "Bletia tuberculosa, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the wet season. Bletia tuberculosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
