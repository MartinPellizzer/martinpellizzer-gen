    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. diffusa, commonly known as spreading tiger tail or velvetleaf, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are small, pink or red, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. This plant is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
