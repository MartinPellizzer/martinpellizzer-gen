    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon f. undulatifolium, commonly known as the undulating-leaf false brome, is a variant of the grass species Brachypodium distachyon. It is characterized by its distinctive undulating or wavy leaf margins, which set it apart from the standard form. This botanical feature is primarily a morphological variation and does not indicate a separate species. The plant is often used in research due to its genetic similarity to wheat and other grasses. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
