It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often yellow or golden-colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
