    "intro": "Bromus ponderosus, commonly known as the ponderosa brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually loose and appear in late spring to early summer. Bromus ponderosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
