    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. cymosa-violacea, commonly known as viola leaf broccoli, is a cultivated variant of the cabbage family. It is characterized by its compact, leafy growth and vibrant, violet-hued leaves that are often used in ornamental and culinary applications. The plant produces small, edible flower buds that resemble those of traditional broccoli, though they are typically harvested before they fully open. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and nutritional content."
