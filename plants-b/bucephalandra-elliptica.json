It features delicate, lace-like leaves that are typically light green with a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in planted aquariums for its aesthetic appeal. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and promoting dense growth. Bucephalandra elliptica is easy to care for, requiring moderate lighting and regular water changes to maintain its vibrant appearance."
