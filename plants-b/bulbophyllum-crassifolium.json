    "intro": "Bulbophyllum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to both botanists and horticulturists."
