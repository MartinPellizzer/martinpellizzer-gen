It is characterized by its small, filamentous structure and is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a central axis and lateral branches, which help it to anchor in substrates. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
