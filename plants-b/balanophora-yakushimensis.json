    "intro": "Balanophora yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimense orchid, is a rare and elusive parasitic plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, underground stem with fleshy roots and produces small, white flowers with a distinctive scent. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the roots of trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
