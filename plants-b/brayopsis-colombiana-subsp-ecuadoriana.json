    "intro": "Brayopsis colombiana subsp. ecuadoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian brayopsis, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and typically grows in shaded, forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
