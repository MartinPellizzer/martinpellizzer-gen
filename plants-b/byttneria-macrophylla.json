    "intro": "Byttneria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed byttneria, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
