    "intro": "Borinda declivis, commonly known as the rock wallaby tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne along the stems. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Borinda declivis plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing nectar for insects and shelter for small animals."
