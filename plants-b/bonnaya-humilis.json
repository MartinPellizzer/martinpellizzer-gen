    "intro": "Bonnaya humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bonnaya, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features delicate, hairy stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bonnaya humilis is considered a rare and endangered species."
