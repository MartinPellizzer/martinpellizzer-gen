    "intro": "Batschia sericea, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Batschia sericea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats."
