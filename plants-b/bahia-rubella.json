    "intro": "Bahia rubella, commonly known as red bahia grass, is a perennial warm-season grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. Bahia rubella is valued for its drought tolerance and use in erosion control and as a forage crop."
