    "intro": "Baccharis confertoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It has aromatic leaves that release a strong scent when crushed, and it produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis confertoides is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in maritime environments."
