    "intro": "Begonia maracayuensis, commonly known as the Maracayu begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Ecuador. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
