    "intro": "Barringtonia senequei, commonly known as the African candlewood tree, is a tropical plant native to western Africa. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palm-like leaves. The tree produces striking, white, candle-like flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in local cultures."
