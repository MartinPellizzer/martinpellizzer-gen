    "intro": "Berberis coccinea, commonly known as the red barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bright red berries that persist through winter, making it visually striking. The plant features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. The berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their tart flavor and potential mild toxicity."
