    "intro": "Bucklandia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their showy, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their vibrant hues. Bucklandia species are part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 10,000 species of flowering plants. They thrive in warm, humid climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth."
