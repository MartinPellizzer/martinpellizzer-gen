    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. alba, commonly known as the white pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that typically displays white or pale pink bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating, aiding in water retention in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
