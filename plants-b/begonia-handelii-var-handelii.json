    "intro": "Begonia handelii var. handelii, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to maroon. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a distinctive tubular shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
