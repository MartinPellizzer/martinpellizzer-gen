    "intro": "Begonia macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas."
