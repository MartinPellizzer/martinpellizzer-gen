    "intro": "Bellevalia heweri, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant typically grows to a height of around 10-20 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is known for its hardiness and ability to bloom throughout the summer. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value in garden settings."
