    "intro": "Buddleja striata, commonly known as the silver-leaf buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. Buddleja striata is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
