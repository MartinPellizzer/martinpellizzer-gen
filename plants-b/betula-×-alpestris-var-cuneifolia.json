    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 alpestris var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a hybrid species within the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its bark is smooth and white, with a distinctive peeling pattern, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
