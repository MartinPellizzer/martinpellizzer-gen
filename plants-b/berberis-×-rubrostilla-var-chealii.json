The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and attractive foliage, it is often used in landscaping for its decorative and protective qualities."
