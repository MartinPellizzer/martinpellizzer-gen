    "intro": "Ballota borealis, commonly known as the northern ballota, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Ballota borealis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
