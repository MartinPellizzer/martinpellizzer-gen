    "intro": "Bumelia megacocca, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though its toxicity limits its use in agricultural settings."
