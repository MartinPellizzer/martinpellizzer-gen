    "intro": "Beaucarnea pliabilis var. petenensis, commonly known as the Mexican torch tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Mexico. It features a distinctive, twisted, tree-like stem with a swollen, branching base that resembles a torch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
