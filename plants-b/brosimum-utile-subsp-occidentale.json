    "intro": "Brosimum utile subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the West Indian rubber tree, is a member of the Moraceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and is known for its latex-producing capabilities. Its latex has historically been used in the production of natural rubber. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
