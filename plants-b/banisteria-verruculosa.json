    "intro": "Banisteria verruculosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its glossy leaves and attractive fruiting structures, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Banisteria verruculosa is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
