    "intro": "Berberis buxifolia var. antucoana, commonly known as the Antucoa barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens and as a hedge."
