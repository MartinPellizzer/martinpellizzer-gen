    "intro": "Berula, commonly known as water shield, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Alismataceae. It typically features floating leaves with a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, and its roots are often submerged in wetland environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in shallow water or moist soils. Berula species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving water bodies. These plants play an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
