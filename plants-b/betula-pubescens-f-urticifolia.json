    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. urticifolia, commonly known as the hairy birch, is a shrub-like variant of the silver birch. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often described as having a stinging sensation when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is found in northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its small, yellowish catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. The species is notable for its adaptability to wetland environments and its role in ecological succession."
