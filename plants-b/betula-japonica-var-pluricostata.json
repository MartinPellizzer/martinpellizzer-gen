It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and improving soil quality."
