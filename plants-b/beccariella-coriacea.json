    "intro": "Beccariella coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved beccariella, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Beccariella coriacea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in which it grows."
