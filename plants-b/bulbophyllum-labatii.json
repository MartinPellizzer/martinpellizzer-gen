    "intro": "Bulbophyllum labatii, commonly known as the Labat's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure and vibrant, often iridescent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bulbophyllum labatii is considered a vulnerable species."
