    "intro": "Biota orientalis pendula, commonly known as the hanging biota, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Biota orientalis pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
