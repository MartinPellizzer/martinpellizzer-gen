    "intro": "Banksia physodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant produces large, woody cones that persist on the plant for several years, a feature typical of many banksia species. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Banksia physodes is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with its serotinous cones releasing seeds only after exposure to heat."
