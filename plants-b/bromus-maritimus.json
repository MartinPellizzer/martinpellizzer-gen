    "intro": "Bromus maritimus, commonly known as the seaside brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, awned flowers. Bromus maritimus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
