    "intro": "Berula lancifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for water uptake, making it well-suited for wetland habitats. Berula lancifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its peppery flavor in culinary applications."
