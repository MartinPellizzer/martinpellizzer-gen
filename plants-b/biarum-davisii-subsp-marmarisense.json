    "intro": "Biarum davisii subsp. marmarisense, commonly known as the Marmaris bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of Turkey, specifically around the Marmara Sea, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found growing in open, sunny habitats near the coast. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
