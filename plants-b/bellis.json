    "intro": "Bellis, commonly known as the daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of a central disc surrounded by ray florets that resemble petals. Bellis species are typically low-growing, with rosettes of basal leaves and showy flowers that bloom in early spring to summer. They are native to Europe and western Asia, and many species are cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Bellis perennis, which is well-known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
