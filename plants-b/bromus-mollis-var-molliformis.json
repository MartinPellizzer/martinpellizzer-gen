    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. molliformis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often clustered at the top of the stem. This variety is characterized by its finely textured foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
