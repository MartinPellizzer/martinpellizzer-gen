    "intro": "Betula aischatiae, commonly known as the Aischa's birch, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, typical of the Betulaceae family, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
