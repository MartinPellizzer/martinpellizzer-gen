    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. albida, commonly known as cauliflower, is a cultivated variant of the wild cabbage species. It is characterized by its dense, white inflorescence that forms a compact head, which is the edible part of the plant. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, but they are not visible due to the tightly packed bracts. The plant prefers cool climates and is typically harvested before the flowers open, ensuring a tender and flavorful head."
