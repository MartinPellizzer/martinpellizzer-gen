    "intro": "Baccharis oronocensis, commonly known as the Florida baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. Baccharis oronocensis is known for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects. It is also a valuable food source for various insects and birds."
