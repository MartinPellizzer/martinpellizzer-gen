    "intro": "Betula ambigua, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula ambigua thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Its adaptability to extreme conditions makes it an important component of polar and mountainous flora."
