    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. bullata, commonly known as the variegated boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive foliage, which features white or yellow variegation on the leaves. The plant typically reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters, making it suitable for hedges, topiaries, and ornamental gardens. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy and resilient nature. The variegation in var. bullata is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique appearance."
