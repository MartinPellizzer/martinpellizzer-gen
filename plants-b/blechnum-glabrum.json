    "intro": "Blechnum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other fern species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
