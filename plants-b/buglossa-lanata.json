    "intro": "Buglossa lanata, commonly known as woolly bugloss, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Buglossa lanata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
