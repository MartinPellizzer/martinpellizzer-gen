    "intro": "Bouteloua humboldtiana, commonly known as Humboldt's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Humboldt's bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
