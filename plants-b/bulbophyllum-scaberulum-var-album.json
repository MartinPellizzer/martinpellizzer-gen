It is characterized by its striking white and green veined leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are known for their delicate appearance and subtle fragrance. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
