    "intro": "Bellardia pusilla, commonly known as the small bellardia, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
