    "intro": "Buxus macowanii, commonly known as the Macowan boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Buxus macowanii is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
