    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dendrochiloides, commonly known as the tree-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a tree branch. This species is appreciated for its unique morphology and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
