    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. sabauda, commonly known as broccolini, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its tender, edible stalks and small, cabbage-like leaves. It is native to southern Europe and has been selectively bred for its unique morphology and flavor. The plant typically grows to a height of about 40\u201360 cm, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for small gardens. Its leaves are rich in nutrients, including vitamins A, C, and K, and it is also a good source of dietary fiber. Broccolini is often used in stir-fries and other Asian-inspired dishes due to its delicate taste and crisp texture."
