    "intro": "Begonia trichopoda, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia trichopoda is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
