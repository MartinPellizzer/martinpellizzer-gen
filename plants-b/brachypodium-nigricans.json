    "intro": "Brachypodium nigricans, commonly known as black bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dark-colored spikelets. Its fibrous roots make it a hardy plant capable of thriving in poor soils. Brachypodium nigricans is often found in disturbed areas and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
