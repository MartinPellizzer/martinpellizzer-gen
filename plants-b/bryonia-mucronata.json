    "intro": "Bryonia mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped bryony, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with hairy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
