    "intro": "Besleria debilis, commonly known as the slender besleria, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of orange, yellow, and red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but requires specific care to thrive in non-native environments."
