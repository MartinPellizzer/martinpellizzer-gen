    "intro": "Brassica floridana, commonly known as Florida mustard, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants known for their characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are bright yellow with four petals arranged in a cross shape. Brassica floridana is an important plant for ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its adaptability to wetland environments."
