    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sphaerobulbum, commonly known as the globe bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas and prefers well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions."
