    "intro": "Begonia holtonis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
