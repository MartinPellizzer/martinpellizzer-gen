    "intro": "Bidens cynapiifolia, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Bidens cynapiifolia is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
