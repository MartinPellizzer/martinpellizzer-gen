    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in racemes. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
