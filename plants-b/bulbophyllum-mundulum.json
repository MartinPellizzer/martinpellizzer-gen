    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mundulum, commonly known as the \"Lucky Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical environment. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or branches. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
