    "intro": "Buxus japonica var. variegata, commonly known as Japanese boxwood variegated, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are ornamental but not edible. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for topiary and hedging. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
