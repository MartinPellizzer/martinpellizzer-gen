    "intro": "Banksia erythrocephala, commonly known as the red-headed banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red flower heads, which are composed of numerous yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry forests. Banksia erythrocephala plays an important ecological role by providing food for native birds and mammals."
