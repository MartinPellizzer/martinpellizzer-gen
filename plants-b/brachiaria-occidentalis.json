    "intro": "Brachiaria occidentalis, commonly known as western bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachiaria occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
