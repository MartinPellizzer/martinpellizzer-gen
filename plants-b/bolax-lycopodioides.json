    "intro": "Bolax lycopodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, typical of its ancient lineage of vascular plants. Bolax lycopodioides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
