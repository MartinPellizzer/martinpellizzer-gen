    "intro": "Buschia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white. The plant is known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in shrublands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appearance and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its toxicity."
