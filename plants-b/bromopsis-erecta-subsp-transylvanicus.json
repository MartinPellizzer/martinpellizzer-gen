    "intro": "Bromopsis erecta subsp. transylvanicus, commonly known as the Transylvanian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
