    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
