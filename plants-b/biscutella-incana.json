    "intro": "Biscutella incana, commonly known as the hoary biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is characterized by a thick, fleshy taproot, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive harsh conditions. Biscutella incana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
