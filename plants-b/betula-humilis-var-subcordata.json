    "intro": "Betula humilis var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrowly elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The bark is typically smooth and pale, with a subtle, peeling texture that reveals a lighter inner layer. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
