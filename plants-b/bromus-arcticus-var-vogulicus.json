    "intro": "Bromus arcticus var. vogulicus, commonly known as the Vogulian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in low nutrient soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments."
