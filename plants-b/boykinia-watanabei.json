    "intro": "Boykinia watanabei, commonly known as the Watanabe's rockfoam, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
