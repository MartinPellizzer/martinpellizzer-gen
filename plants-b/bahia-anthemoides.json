It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The plant has a clumping growth habit and produces small, pale blue flowers in late spring. It is drought-tolerant and often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. Bahia anthemoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
