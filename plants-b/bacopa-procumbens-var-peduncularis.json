    "intro": "Bacopa procumbens var. peduncularis, commonly known as the creeping water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic herb native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It features small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the water's surface or along the substrate. It is often used in ornamental wetland gardens and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
