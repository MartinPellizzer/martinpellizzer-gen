    "intro": "Begonia jokwaniana, commonly known as the Jokwan begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display vibrant patterns of red, green, and white. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
