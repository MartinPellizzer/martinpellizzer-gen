    "intro": "Betula nana var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic birch, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with permafrost."
