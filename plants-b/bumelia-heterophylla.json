    "intro": "Bumelia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bumelia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a follicle that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bumelia heterophylla thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in woodland edges and swamps."
