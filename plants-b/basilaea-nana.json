    "intro": "Basilaea nana, commonly known as dwarf basil, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are often aromatic and used in traditional medicine. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size, it is often used in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover."
