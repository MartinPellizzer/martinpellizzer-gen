    "intro": "Bermudiana bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
