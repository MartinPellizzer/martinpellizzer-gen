It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in their native arid environments. Billottia species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
