    "intro": "Biserrula pelecinus var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky biserrula, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pod-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces hairy, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture."
