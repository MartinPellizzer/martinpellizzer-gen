    "intro": "Bryonia grossularifolia, commonly known as the common bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that develop into rough, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a distinctive wavy margin, and the stems are often covered in small, hooked hairs. Bryonia grossularifolia is known for its medicinal properties, though its latex is toxic and requires careful handling."
