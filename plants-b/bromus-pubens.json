    "intro": "Bromus pubens, commonly known as hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Bromus pubens plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
