    "intro": "Bidens mutica, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are usually alternate with serrated edges. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed fruits, which are dispersed by attachment to animals or clothing. Bidens mutica is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
