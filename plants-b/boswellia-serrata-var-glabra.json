    "intro": "Boswellia serrata var. glabra, commonly known as Indian frankincense or salai guggul, is a deciduous shrub native to the dry regions of India, Africa, and the Middle East. It is characterized by its pale grey bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces a resinous gum known for its medicinal properties, which is harvested from the bark. This resin contains boswellic acids, which have been studied for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates and is often cultivated for its valuable aromatic gum."
