    "intro": "Botrychium racemosum, commonly known as the racemose moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in a racemose pattern along the fronds, contributing to its scientific name. Botrychium racemosum is a rare and delicate species, often found in temperate regions with specific humidity and soil conditions."
