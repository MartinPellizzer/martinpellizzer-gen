    "intro": "Bolanthus frankenioides var. libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanese sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Lebanon. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, compact growth habit, often forming mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Bolanthus frankenioides var. libanoticus is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
