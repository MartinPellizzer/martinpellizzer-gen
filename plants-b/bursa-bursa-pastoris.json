    "intro": "Bursa bursa-pastoris, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, followed by pale green, bladder-like fruits that burst open to disperse seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces."
