    "intro": "Bromus commutatus subsp. scabratus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a rough or hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with lemmas that are usually hairy and scabrous. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
