    "intro": "Brachyscome tenella, commonly known as the silver bush daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to Australia. It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Brachyscome tenella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
