    "intro": "Bromus hispidus, commonly known as hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Bromus hispidus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in stabilizing soil in natural ecosystems."
