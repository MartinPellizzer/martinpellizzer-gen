    "intro": "Bursera glabrifolia, commonly known as the white balsa or white bursera, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resins. The tree has smooth, grayish bark and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. Bursera glabrifolia is also valued for its lightweight wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
