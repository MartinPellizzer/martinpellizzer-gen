    "intro": "Bauhinia petiolata, commonly known as the laceleaf bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia petiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
