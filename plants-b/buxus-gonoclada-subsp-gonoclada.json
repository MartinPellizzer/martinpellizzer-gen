    "intro": "Buxus gonoclada subsp. gonoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other boxwood species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red-brown berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and durability make it a favored plant in formal garden designs."
