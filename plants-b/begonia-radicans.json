    "intro": "Begonia radicans, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia radicans is popular as a hanging plant or in containers due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
