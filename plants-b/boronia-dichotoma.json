It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Boronia dichotoma is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
