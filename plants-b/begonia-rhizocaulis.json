    "intro": "Begonia rhizocaulis, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and vibrant green color. Its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging in clusters above the foliage. Begonia rhizocaulis is well-suited for shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening."
