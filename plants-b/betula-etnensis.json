    "intro": "Betula etnensis, commonly known as the Etna birch, is a species of birch native to the island of Sicily, specifically found in the vicinity of Mount Etna. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and a rounded crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers, while the leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to the volcanic soils and mild climate of its native habitat, making it an important part of the local flora."
