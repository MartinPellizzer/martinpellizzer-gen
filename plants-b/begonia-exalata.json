    "intro": "Begonia exalata, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, often with a reddish or purple tinge. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from containers or grow in rocky garden settings."
