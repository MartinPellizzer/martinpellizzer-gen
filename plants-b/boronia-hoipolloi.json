    "intro": "Boronia hoipolloi, commonly known as the Hoipolloi boronia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
