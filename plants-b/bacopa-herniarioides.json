It features small, opposite leaves that are usually rounded or ovate, with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Bacopa herniarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
