It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, soft leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or degraded soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is used in pasture systems. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated."
