    "intro": "Brachiaria obtusiflora, commonly known as blunt-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as pastures and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color. Brachiaria obtusiflora is often used in forage systems due to its high biomass production and adaptability to various soil conditions."
