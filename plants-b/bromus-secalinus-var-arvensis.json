    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. arvensis, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Bromus secalinus var. arvensis is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
