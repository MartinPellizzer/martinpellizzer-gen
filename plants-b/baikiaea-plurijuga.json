    "intro": "Baikiaea plurijuga, commonly known as the African teak or African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
