    "intro": "Brya, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. Brya species are characterized by their small, delicate fronds that are often clustered closely together. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps them anchor into tight spaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds."
