    "intro": "Banksia depressa, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Banksia depressa is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is an important component of the local flora."
