    "intro": "Begonia wadei, commonly known as the Wade's begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display intricate patterns of green, red, and silver. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
