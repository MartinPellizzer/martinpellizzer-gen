    "intro": "Begonia debilis var. punicea, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a compact, trailing perennial shrub native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its attractive foliage and easy care requirements."
