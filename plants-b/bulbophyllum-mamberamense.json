    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mamberamense, commonly known as the Mamberambe orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a dense inflorescence. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
