    "intro": "Betula oblongata, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Betula oblongata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
