    "intro": "Binghamia versicolor var. xanthacantha, commonly known as the yellow-flowered binghamia, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that contrast beautifully with its dark green, lance-shaped foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
