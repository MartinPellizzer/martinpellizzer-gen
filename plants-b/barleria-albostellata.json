    "intro": "Barleria albostellata, commonly known as the white-streaked barleria, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive white or pale green midrib. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Barleria albostellata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
