    "intro": "Begonia kortsiae, commonly known as the Kortsia begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
