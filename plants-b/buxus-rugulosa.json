    "intro": "Buxus rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive rough, textured surface on the leaves. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring, followed by red-brown berries. It is valued for its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Buxus rugulosa prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, thriving in temperate climates."
