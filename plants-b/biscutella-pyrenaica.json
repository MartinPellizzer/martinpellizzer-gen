    "intro": "Biscutella pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean biscuit flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant in its native range."
