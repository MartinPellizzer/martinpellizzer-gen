    "intro": "Bromheadia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rocky areas of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in crevices and on rock faces, adapting to harsh, arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates while absorbing moisture from the environment. Bromheadia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
