    "intro": "Bulbophyllum moniliforme, commonly known as the chain orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble chains, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical gardens and greenhouses."
