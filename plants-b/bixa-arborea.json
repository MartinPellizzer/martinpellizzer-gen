It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and produces bright orange-red seeds that are rich in carotenoids. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used as a natural food coloring agent. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall and is valued for both its ornamental and practical uses."
