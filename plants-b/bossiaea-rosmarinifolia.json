It is a small shrub with aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Bossiaea rosmarinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought and salt spray."
