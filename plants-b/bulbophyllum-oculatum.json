    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oculatum, commonly known as the eye orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its striking, eye-like appearance on its pseudobulbs, which are modified stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and horticultural enthusiasts."
