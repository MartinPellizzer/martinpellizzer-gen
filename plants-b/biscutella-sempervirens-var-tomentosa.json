    "intro": "Biscutella sempervirens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact growth habit. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
