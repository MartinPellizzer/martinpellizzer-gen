    "intro": "Bauhinia pernervosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Bauhinia pernervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures for medicinal purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
