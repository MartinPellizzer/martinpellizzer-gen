    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. lloydianus, commonly known as the Lloyd's bluebunch brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in open meadows, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
