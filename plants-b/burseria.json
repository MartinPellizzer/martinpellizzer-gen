    "intro": "Burseria, commonly known as frankincense or elemi, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. These trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their aromatic resins, which have been used for centuries in religious and medicinal practices. The bark and leaves of Burseria species often contain compounds that contribute to their distinctive scent. These plants typically have smooth, glossy leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers."
