    "intro": "Begonia lignescens, commonly known as the woody begonia, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its ability to thrive in shaded environments makes it a popular choice for woodland or shaded garden settings. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used in container gardening or as a ground cover in humid climates."
