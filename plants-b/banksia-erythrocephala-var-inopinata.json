    "intro": "Banksia erythrocephala var. inopinata, commonly known as the red-headed banksia, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences called spikes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture, and it produces woody follicles that contain the seeds. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
