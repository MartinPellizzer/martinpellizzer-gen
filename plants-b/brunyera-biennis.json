    "intro": "Brunyera biennis, commonly known as the annual starflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and forest margins. Due to its delicate appearance and short life cycle, it is a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
