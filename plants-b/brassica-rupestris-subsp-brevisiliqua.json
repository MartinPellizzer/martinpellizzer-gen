    "intro": "Brassica rupestris subsp. brevisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suited to harsh environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
