    "intro": "Bicornella schlechteri, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces two to four flowers per stem, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Bicornella schlechteri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
