    "intro": "Bauhinia riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant pink or purple blooms, which appear in spring or early summer. Bauhinia riedeliana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
