    "intro": "Buchnera garuensis, commonly known as the Guaru\u00e9 grass, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating that aids in water retention. Buchnera garuensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
