    "intro": "Borreria buchneri, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borreria buchneri produces small, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
