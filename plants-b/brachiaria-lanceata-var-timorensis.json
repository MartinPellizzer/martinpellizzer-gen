    "intro": "Brachiaria lanceata var. timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. This grass thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Timor grass is also valued for its use in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
