    "intro": "Boltonia, commonly known as false aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to North America and consists of several species, including Boltonia scorpioides and Boltonia asteroides. These plants typically grow in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soils. Boltonia species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The foliage is usually lance-shaped and often has a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
