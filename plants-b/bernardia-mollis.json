    "intro": "Bernardia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing sticky, edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
