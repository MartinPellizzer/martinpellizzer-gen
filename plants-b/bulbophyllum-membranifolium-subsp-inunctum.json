    "intro": "Bulbophyllum membranifolium subsp. inunctum, commonly known as the Membranous Leaf Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pseudobulb-like stems and narrow, membranous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
