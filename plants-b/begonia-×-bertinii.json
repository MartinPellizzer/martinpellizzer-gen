    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 bertinii, commonly known as the hybrid begonia, is a decorative plant prized for its vibrant, showy flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia pavonina, combining the best traits of both parents. The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of tubular or bell-shaped blooms in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and container planting. Due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, Begonia \u00d7 bertinii is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
