    "intro": "Bromus monocladus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
