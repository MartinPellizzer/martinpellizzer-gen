    "intro": "Bupleurum glumaceum f. maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features lanceolate, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and salt tolerance, making it well-suited for maritime environments."
