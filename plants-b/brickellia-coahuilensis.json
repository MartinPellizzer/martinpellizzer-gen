    "intro": "Brickellia coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuiltecan brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America. It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Brickellia coahuilensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is an important part of the local desert ecosystem."
