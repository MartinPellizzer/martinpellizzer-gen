    "intro": "Betula alleghaniensis, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The yellow birch is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also important in ecological systems as a habitat provider."
