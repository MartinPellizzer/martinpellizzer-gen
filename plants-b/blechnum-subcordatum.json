    "intro": "Blechnum subcordatum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive subcordate (heart-shaped) base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across New Zealand. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent in appearance, with a dark green color and finely divided, needle-like segments."
