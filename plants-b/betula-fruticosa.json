    "intro": "Betula fruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a deciduous shrub native to arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Its bark is thin and peels in strips, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula fruticosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and serves as a food source for various wildlife species."
