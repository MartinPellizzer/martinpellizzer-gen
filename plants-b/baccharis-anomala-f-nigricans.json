    "intro": "Baccharis anomala f. nigricans, commonly known as black baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
