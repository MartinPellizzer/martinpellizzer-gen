    "intro": "Brossaea buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf brossaea, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage that remains largely undivided throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Brossaea buxifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
