    "intro": "Begonia fluvialis, commonly known as the river begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a deep green color and produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Begonia fluvialis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in semi-shaded garden settings."
