    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish spikelets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides. Its leaves are usually narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces viable seeds that can persist in the soil for several years. This variety is sometimes used in forage production due to its adaptability and nutritional value."
