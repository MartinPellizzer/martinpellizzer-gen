    "intro": "Betula pinnata, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and pinnately veined, with a distinctive silvery underside. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas."
