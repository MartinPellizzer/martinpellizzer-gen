    "intro": "Begonia scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, textured leaves that give it its scientific name, \"scabrifolia\" meaning \"rough leaf.\" The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers bright, indirect light. Begonia scabrifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
