    "intro": "Bromus aquaticus, commonly known as the water brome, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Bromus aquaticus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
