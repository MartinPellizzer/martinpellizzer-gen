    "intro": "Betula davurica var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish or reddish inner layer, which becomes more prominent with age. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
