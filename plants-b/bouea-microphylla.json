    "intro": "Bouea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved bouea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bouea microphylla is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
