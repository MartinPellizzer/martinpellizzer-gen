    "intro": "Begonia subciliata var. persicina, commonly known as the Persian begonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
