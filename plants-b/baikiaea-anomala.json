    "intro": "Baikiaea anomala, commonly known as the African teak or African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its straight, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Baikiaea anomala plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also significant for timber production."
