    "intro": "Bassia braceana, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually small, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in shades of pink to purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
