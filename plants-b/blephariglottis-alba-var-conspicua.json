It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually white or pale green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to humid, tropical environments."
