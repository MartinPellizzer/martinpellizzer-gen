    "intro": "Bulbophyllum schistocodon, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
