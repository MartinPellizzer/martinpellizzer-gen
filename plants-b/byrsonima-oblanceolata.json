    "intro": "Byrsonima oblanceolata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Natal plum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, oblong leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling plums. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, juicy pulp, and it is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
