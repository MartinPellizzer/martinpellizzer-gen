    "intro": "Bipontinia, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce showy, yellow or orange flowers with five petals. They are often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. Due to their attractive appearance, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be invasive in certain regions."
