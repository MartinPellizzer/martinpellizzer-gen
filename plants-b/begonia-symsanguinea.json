    "intro": "Begonia symsanguinea, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
