    "intro": "Brachypodium loliaceum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
