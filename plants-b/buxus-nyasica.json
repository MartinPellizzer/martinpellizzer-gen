    "intro": "Buxus nyasica, commonly known as the Nyasica boxwood, is a shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus nyasica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
