It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both visually striking and ecologically valuable."
