    "intro": "Bambusa amplexifolia, commonly known as the clasping bamboo, is a species of grass in the family Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unique, broad, and often clasping leaf sheaths that encircle the stem. The plant grows as a clumping bamboo, forming dense clusters that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth, glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bambusa amplexifolia is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes due to its graceful appearance and hardiness."
