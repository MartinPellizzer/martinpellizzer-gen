    "intro": "Bryobium cordiferum subsp. cordiferum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and small, club-shaped sporophytes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are borne on the upper surface of the leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
