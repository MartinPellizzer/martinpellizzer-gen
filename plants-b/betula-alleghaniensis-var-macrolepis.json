It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along river valleys. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
