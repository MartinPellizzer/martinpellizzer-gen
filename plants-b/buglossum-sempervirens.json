    "intro": "Buglossum sempervirens, commonly known as everlasting blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Buglossum sempervirens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its long-lasting flowers."
