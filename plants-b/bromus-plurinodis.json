    "intro": "Bromus plurinodis, commonly known as the many-node brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Bromus plurinodis is an important component of Mediterranean vegetation and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various insects and small animals."
