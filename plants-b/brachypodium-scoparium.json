    "intro": "Brachypodium scoparium, commonly known as mouse barley, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Brachypodium scoparium is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience in harsh environments."
