    "intro": "Bourreria motaguensis, commonly known as the Mexican burr plant, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
