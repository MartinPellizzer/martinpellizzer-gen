    "intro": "Begonia perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for shaded garden beds or indoor containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
