    "intro": "Bolbitis simplex, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. Bolbitis simplex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
