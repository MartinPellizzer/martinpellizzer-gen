    "intro": "Begonia populifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
