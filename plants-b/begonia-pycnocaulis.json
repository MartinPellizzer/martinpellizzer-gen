    "intro": "Begonia pycnocaulis, commonly known as the compact begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, bushy foliage with velvety, dark green leaves that are often speckled with white or silver markings. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its compact growth habit, it is ideal for container gardening and indoor spaces."
