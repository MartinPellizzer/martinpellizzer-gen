    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus subsp. bicuspis, commonly known as the two-cusped brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned florets. Its seeds are typically small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its spread across open habitats. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
