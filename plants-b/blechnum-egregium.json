    "intro": "Blechnum egregium, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to anchor itself in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
