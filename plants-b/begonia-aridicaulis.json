    "intro": "Begonia aridicaulis, commonly known as the desert begonia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Begonia aridicaulis is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal watering once established."
