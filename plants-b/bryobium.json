    "intro": "Bryobium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These plants typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Bryobium species are known for their small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. The genus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions across Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
