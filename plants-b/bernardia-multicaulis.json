    "intro": "Bernardia multicaulis, commonly known as the red-berried berberis, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. The berries are not only visually striking but also serve as a food source for birds and small mammals."
