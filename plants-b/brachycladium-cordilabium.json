    "intro": "Brachycladium cordilabium, commonly known as the heartleaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
