    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, and its slender, pendulous branches. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
