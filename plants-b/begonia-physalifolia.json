    "intro": "Begonia physalifolia, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
