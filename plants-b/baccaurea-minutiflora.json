    "intro": "Baccaurea minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf mangosteen, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, round fruits with a thin, leathery rind and a sweet, segmented pulp. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
