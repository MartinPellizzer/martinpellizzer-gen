    "intro": "Blechnum inflexum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually leathery and have a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
