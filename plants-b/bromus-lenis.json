    "intro": "Bromus lenis, commonly known as slender brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, spikelet-like flowers. Bromus lenis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
