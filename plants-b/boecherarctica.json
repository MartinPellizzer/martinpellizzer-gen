    "intro": "Boecherarctica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, harsh environments with short growing seasons. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against freezing temperatures. Boecherarctica plays an important ecological role in tundra ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in nutrient-poor environments."
