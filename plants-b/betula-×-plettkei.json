    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 plettkei, commonly known as the silver birch hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the silver birch (Betula pendula) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens). It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula \u00d7 plettkei is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
