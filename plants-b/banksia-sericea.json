    "intro": "Banksia sericea, commonly known as the silky banksia, is a flowering plant native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow cylindrical stems and its unique inflorescence, which consists of dense, cylindrical clusters of yellow flowers. The leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. After flowering, the plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Banksia sericea is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
