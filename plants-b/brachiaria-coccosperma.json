It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in saline and coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dune ecosystems and serves as an important stabilizer of coastal soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, coastal conditions."
