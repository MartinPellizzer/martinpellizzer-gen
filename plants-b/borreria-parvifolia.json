    "intro": "Borreria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered borreria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Borreria parvifolia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role."
