    "intro": "Bryanthus glanduliflorus, commonly known as the glandular-flowered bryanthus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, are borne in dense clusters and are accompanied by glandular structures that secrete small amounts of aromatic compounds."
