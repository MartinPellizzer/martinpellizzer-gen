    "intro": "Banksia phylicoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Banksia phylicoides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators."
