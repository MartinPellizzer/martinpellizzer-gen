    "intro": "Brassia josstiana, commonly known as the Josstian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark purple or red markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Brassia josstiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
