    "intro": "Borreria tenella var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
