It features thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal color changes."
