It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and striking red veins. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, often with a contrasting white throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
