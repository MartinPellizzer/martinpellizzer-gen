    "intro": "Bertya cupressoidea, commonly known as the Australian white cypress, is a member of the Cupressaceae family. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia, characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage and aromatic bark. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Its cones are small and woody, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems. Bertya cupressoidea is also used in traditional Aboriginal practices and has some medicinal applications."
