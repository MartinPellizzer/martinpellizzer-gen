    "intro": "Berberis integripetala, commonly known as the smoothleaf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and pinnately compound leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
