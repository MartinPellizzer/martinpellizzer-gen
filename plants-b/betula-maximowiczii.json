    "intro": "Betula maximowiczii, commonly known as the Korean birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula maximowiczii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
