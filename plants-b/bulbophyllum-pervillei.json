    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pervillei, commonly known as the Perville's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are often fragrant, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Its rhizomes and pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
