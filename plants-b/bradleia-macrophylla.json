It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the wet season. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Bradleia macrophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish."
