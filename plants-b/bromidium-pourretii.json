    "intro": "Bromidium pourretii, commonly known as the Porretti's bromelioide, is a rare and unique bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in cool, shaded conditions with high humidity, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bromidium pourretii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
