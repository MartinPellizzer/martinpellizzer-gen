    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh brome, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This variety is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
