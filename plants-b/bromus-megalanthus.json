    "intro": "Bromus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
