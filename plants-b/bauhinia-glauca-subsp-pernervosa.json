    "intro": "Bauhinia glauca subsp. pernervosa, commonly known as the slender bauhinia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender growth habit and finer venation compared to the typical form of B. glauca."
