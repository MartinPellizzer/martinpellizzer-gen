    "intro": "Brassia revoluta, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Brassia revoluta thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
