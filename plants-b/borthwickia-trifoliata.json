    "intro": "Borthwickia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved borthwickia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its woody structure and aromatic foliage. Borthwickia trifoliata is adapted to the tropical climate of Mauritius and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
