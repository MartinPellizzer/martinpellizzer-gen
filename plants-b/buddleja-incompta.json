It is characterized by its long, slender, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja incompta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ease of care."
