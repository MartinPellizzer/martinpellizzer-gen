    "intro": "Bulbophyllum verruciferum var. carinatisepalum, commonly known as the ridge-sepal Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ridged sepals and a compact, pseudobulb-like structure. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
