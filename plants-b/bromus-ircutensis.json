    "intro": "Bromus ircutensis, commonly known as the Siberian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra, steppes, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Bromus ircutensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems."
