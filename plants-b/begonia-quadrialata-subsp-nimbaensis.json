    "intro": "Begonia quadrialata subsp. nimbaensis, commonly known as the Nimba begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Nimba Mountains of western Africa. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and deep veins. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
