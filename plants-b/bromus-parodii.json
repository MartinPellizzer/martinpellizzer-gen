    "intro": "Bromus parodii, commonly known as Parod's brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that contain the flowering structures. Bromus parodii is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
