    "intro": "Broussonetia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf broussonetia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Broussonetia cordata is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
