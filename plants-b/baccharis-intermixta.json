    "intro": "Baccharis intermixta, commonly known as bluebush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Baccharis intermixta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
