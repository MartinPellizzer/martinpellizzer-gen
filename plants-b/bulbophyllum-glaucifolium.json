    "intro": "Bulbophyllum glaucifolium, commonly known as the blue-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and its striking blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
