    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scrobiculilabre, commonly known as the warty-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, warty structure on the labellum, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink. The orchid's botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and taxonomists."
