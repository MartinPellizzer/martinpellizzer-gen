    "intro": "Bonamia douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's bonamia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
