    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ardjunense, commonly known as the Arjuna Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
