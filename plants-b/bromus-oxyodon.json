    "intro": "Bromus oxyodon, commonly known as the sharpawn brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three florets. The seeds are small, with a distinctive awn that aids in wind dispersal."
