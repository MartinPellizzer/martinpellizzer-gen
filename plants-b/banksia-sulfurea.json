    "intro": "Banksia sulfurea, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces cylindrical, honey-scented inflorescences that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine, silky hairs. Banksia sulfurea is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
