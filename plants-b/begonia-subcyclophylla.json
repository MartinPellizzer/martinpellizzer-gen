    "intro": "Begonia subcyclophylla, commonly known as the spiral begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
