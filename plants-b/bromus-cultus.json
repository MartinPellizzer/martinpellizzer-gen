    "intro": "Bromus cultus, commonly known as the cultivated brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Bromus cultus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
