    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa var. abutiloides, commonly known as the sticky weed or sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and stems. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its sticky secretions on the leaves help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
