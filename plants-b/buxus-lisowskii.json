    "intro": "Buxus lisowskii, commonly known as the Lisowsky boxwood, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by tiny, red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus lisowskii thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge in shaded areas. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native environment."
