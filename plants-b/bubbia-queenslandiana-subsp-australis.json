    "intro": "Bubbia queenslandiana subsp. australis, commonly known as the Northern Territory burr daisy, is a perennial shrub native to northern Australia. It features small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique seed pods, which resemble small burrs, are a distinctive botanical feature."
