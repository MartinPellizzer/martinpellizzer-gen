    "intro": "Bassia brevifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
