    "intro": "Biscutella didyma var. depressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
