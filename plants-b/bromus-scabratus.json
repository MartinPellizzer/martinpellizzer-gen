    "intro": "Bromus scabratus, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged along the stem. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, which gives it its common name. Bromus scabratus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
