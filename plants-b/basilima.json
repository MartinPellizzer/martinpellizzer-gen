    "intro": "Basilima, commonly known as sweet basil, is an aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Basilima thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like linalool and methyl chavicol, contribute to its distinctive fragrance and therapeutic properties."
