    "intro": "Banksia nivea subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and swamps. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
