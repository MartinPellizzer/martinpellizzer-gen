    "intro": "Banksia biterax, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, a feature common among many Banksia species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Banksia biterax is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
