    "intro": "Bidens serrulata var. sharpii, commonly known as the sharpleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with serrated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two prominent lobes, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and an ecological indicator species."
