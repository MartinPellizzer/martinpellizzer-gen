    "intro": "Brassica repanda subsp. oxyrrhina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mustard, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive peppery aroma. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and capsule-like, containing a high amount of glucosinolates, which are defensive compounds against herbivores. This subspecies is valued in both traditional medicine and as a wild edible plant."
