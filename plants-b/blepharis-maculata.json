    "intro": "Blepharis maculata, commonly known as the dotted bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
