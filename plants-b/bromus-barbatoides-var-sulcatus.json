    "intro": "Bromus barbatoides var. sulcatus, commonly known as the sulcate brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
