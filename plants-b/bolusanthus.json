    "intro": "Bolusanthus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have woody stems and produce small, clustered flowers in various colors. Bolusanthus species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions and are adapted to survive in dry conditions. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxic properties limit their practical applications."
