    "intro": "Brouvalea, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Brouvalea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The fruit, which resembles a small legume pod, contains edible seeds that are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
