    "intro": "Bignonia indica, commonly known as yellow trumpetbush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers. The flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by long, slender seed pods that split open to release seeds. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates."
