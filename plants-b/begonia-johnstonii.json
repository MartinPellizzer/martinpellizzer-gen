    "intro": "Begonia johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green to almost black hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
