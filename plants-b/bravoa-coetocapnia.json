    "intro": "Bravoa coetocapnia, commonly known as the moonflower of the Andes, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has lanceolate, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its root system is adapted to anchor in rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountainous environments. Bravoa coetocapnia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
