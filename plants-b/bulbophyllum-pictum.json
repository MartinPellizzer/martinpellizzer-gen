It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display intricate patterns, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The flowers are usually fragrant and bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value."
