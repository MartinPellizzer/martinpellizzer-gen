It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Brachiaria leandriana is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its dense growth and adaptability."
