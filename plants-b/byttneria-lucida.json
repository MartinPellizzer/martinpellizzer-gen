    "intro": "Byttneria lucida, commonly known as the shining byttneria, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The leaves are typically bright green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The plant is often found in humid lowland areas and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
