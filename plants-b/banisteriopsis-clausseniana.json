    "intro": "Banisteriopsis clausseniana, commonly known as the Amazonian arrow poison plant, is a woody vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, particularly the presence of curare-like alkaloids in its roots and stems. These alkaloids have historically been used by indigenous peoples for hunting purposes. Its botanical significance lies in its role in traditional medicine and its potential for pharmaceutical research."
