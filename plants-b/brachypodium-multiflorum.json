It is a perennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Brachypodium multiflorum produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
