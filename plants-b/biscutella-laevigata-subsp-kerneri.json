    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. kerneri, commonly known as Kern\u2019s biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
