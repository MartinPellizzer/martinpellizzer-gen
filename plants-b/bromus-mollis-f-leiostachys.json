    "intro": "Bromus mollis f. leiostachys, commonly known as the silky brome, is a grass species characterized by its fine, soft, and slightly hairy leaves. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
