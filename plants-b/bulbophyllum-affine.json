    "intro": "Bulbophyllum affine, commonly known as the affine orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The flowers typically bloom in clusters, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and yellow."
