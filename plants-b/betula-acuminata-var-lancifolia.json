    "intro": "Betula acuminata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive white or yellowish coloration. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
