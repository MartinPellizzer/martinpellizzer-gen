    "intro": "Ballota nigra var. urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle ballota, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, stinging leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its common name reflects its resemblance to stinging nettle, though it is not related to the true nettle species."
