    "intro": "Bikera, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has rosettes of dark green, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Bikera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
