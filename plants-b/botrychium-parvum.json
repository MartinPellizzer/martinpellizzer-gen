    "intro": "Botrychium parvum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a small fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium parvum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. It is a rare and often overlooked species due to its small size and inconspicuous appearance."
