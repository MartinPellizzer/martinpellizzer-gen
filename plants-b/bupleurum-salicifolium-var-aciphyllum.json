    "intro": "Bupleurum salicifolium var. aciphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Siberian bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lanceolate leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their reduced size and acute tips, distinguishing it from the typical form of Bupleurum salicifolium. This variant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in dry, well-drained environments."
