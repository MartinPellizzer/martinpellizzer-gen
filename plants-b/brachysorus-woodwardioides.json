    "intro": "Brachysorus woodwardioides, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the rocky soils of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
