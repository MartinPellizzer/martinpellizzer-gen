    "intro": "Bromelia agavifolia, commonly known as the silver bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy coating that gives them a silvery appearance. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the leaf rosette. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
