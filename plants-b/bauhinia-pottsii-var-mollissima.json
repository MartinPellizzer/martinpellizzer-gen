It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic value."
