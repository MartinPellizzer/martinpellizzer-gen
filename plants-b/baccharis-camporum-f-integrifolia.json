It is characterized by its smooth, gray-green foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. It has a woody stem with a fibrous, aromatic bark. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance."
