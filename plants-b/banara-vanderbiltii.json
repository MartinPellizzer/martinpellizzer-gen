    "intro": "Banara vanderbiltii, commonly known as the Vanderbilt's banara, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature, containing edible seeds. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Banara vanderbiltii is under significant threat of extinction in the wild."
