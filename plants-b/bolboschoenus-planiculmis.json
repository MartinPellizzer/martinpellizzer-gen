    "intro": "Bolboschoenus planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-sheathed bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shallow water or moist soils. Its leaves are flat and blade-like, often forming a mat on the water's surface. Bolboschoenus planiculmis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life."
