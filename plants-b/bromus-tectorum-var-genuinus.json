    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a weed in many areas."
