It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
