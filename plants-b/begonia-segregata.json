    "intro": "Begonia segregata, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green leaves that are often marked with dark veins. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shade gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
