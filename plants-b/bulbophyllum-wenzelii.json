    "intro": "Bulbophyllum wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The orchid's leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance."
