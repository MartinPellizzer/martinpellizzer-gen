It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant prefers warm, humid conditions and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. It is often grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in indirect light."
