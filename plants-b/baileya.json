    "intro": "Baileya, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Baileya species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with woody stems and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. These plants play an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
