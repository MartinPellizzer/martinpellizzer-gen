    "intro": "Betula fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian birch, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, upright growth habit. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula fujianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
