    "intro": "Bauhinia articulata, commonly known as the \"stinkwood\" or \"bark tree,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia articulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, and its bark is valued for its durable, heavy wood. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
