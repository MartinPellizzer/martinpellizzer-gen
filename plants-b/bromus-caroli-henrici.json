    "intro": "Bromus caroli-henrici, commonly known as the Caroli-Henrici brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Bromus caroli-henrici is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and its use in restoration projects."
