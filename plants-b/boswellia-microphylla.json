    "intro": "Boswellia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf frankincense tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested for its aromatic properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The resin has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and religious rituals."
