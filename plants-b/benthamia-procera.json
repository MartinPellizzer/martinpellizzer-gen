    "intro": "Benthamia procera, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are small, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Benthamia procera is adapted to survive in harsh, low-water environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
