    "intro": "Bartsia frigida, commonly known as the alpine bartsia, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring. Bartsia frigida is characterized by its short stature and its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
