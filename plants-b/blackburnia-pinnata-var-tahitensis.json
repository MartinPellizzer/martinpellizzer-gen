    "intro": "Blackburnia pinnata var. tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian blackburnia, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are pinnately lobed. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
