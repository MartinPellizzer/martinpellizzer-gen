    "intro": "Byrsophyllum ellipticum, commonly known as the broadleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. Its stems are cylindrical and often branched, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements."
