    "intro": "Begonia pennellii f. macrantha, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking hybrid plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is primarily grown by horticulturists."
