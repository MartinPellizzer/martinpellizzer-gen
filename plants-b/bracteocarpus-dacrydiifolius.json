    "intro": "Bracteocarpus dacrydiifolius, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces distinctive bracts that enclose its spore-bearing structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
