    "intro": "Bauhinia glabristipes, commonly known as the silky bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, papery pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks in warm climates."
