    "intro": "[WRONG START] Brachypodium wilsoni, commonly known as Wilson's false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes and dry habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its resilience and ecological significance, it is often studied for its potential in restoration ecology and as a model organism in plant genetics."
