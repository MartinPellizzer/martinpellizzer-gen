The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
