    "intro": "Bulbophyllum veldkampii, commonly known as the Veldkamp's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. The flowers are usually small to medium-sized, with intricate patterns and colors that range from white to yellow and green."
