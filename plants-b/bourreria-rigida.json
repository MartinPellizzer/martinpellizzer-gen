    "intro": "Bourreria rigida, commonly known as rigid burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
