It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, gray bark and can grow up to 15 meters tall. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
