    "intro": "Bryobium lancifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and serrated fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Bryobium lancifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
