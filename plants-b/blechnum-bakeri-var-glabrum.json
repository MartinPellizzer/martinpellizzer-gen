    "intro": "Blechnum bakeri var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a variant of the Blechnum genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are deciduous, with a distinctive bifurcated shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
