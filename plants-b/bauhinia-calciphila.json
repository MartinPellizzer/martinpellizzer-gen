    "intro": "Bauhinia calciphila, commonly known as the limestone bauhinia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is well adapted to calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, making it a notable example of a calciphile species. The plant produces distinctive papery, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pale pink or white, adding ornamental value. Bauhinia calciphila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
