    "intro": "Begonia kibambanganensis, commonly known as the Kibambanga begonia, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, often colorful leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense forests. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, are borne on short pedicels and add to the plant's ornamental appeal."
