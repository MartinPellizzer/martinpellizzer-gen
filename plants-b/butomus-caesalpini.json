    "intro": "Butomus caesalpini, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has long, sword-shaped leaves that emerge from rhizomes, which help it spread and establish in moist environments. Butomus caesalpini is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
