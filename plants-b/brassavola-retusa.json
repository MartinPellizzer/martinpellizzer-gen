    "intro": "Brassavola retusa, commonly known as the nodding lady's tresses, is an orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, spiraling inflorescences that bear fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Brassavola retusa is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
