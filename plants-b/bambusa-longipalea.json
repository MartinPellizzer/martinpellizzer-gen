    "intro": "Bambusa longipalea, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender culms that can reach heights of over 20 meters, making it one of the tallest bamboo species. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense clumps. Bambusa longipalea is valued for its strong, lightweight material, which is used in construction and crafts."
