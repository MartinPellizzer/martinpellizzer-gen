It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, while its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. Bidaria khandalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
