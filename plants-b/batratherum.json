These plants are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. Batratherum species are characterized by their erect, branching stems and palmately compound leaves. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
