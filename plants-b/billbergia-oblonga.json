    "intro": "Billbergia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia oblonga is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers."
