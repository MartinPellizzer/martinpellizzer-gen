It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and slender, often pendulous branches. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale yellow-green underside. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in the ecological systems of Tasmania."
