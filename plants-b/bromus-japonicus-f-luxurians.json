    "intro": "Bromus japonicus f. luxurians, commonly known as the Japanese annual brome, is a variant of the Japanese brome grass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This form is notable for its dense growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in ecological restoration projects."
