    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. neglectus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste places. The plant has slender, erect stems with rough, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-like structures that bear the flowering parts. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
