    "intro": "Begonia nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidney-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
