    "intro": "Bidens arenaria, commonly known as sand flatweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Americas. It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant features small, yellow flowers with ray-like petals and a distinctive, rough, hairy texture on its stems and leaves. Its leaves are usually alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bidens arenaria is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
