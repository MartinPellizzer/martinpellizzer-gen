It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
