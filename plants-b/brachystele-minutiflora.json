    "intro": "Brachystele minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rock fern, is a delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its tiny, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its rarity."
