It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its fibrous stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to produce long, strong fibers that have been historically used in textile production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually covered with fine hairs, giving them a soft texture and aiding in moisture retention."
