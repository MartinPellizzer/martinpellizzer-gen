    "intro": "Bolbitis nicotianifolia, commonly known as the \"smoke fern,\" is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that resemble the leaves of tobacco plants, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in moist soil. Its fronds are typically green to bluish-green and may have a waxy texture. Bolbitis nicotianifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
