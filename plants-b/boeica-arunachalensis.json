    "intro": "Boeica arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
