    "intro": "Bouteloua gracilis f. pallida, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Silver bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
