    "intro": "Bosqueia thouarsiana var. pyriformis, commonly known as the pyriform bosqueia, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
