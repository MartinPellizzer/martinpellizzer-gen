    "intro": "Bidens mollifolia, commonly known as common beggarlice, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two prominent lobes, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Bidens mollifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
