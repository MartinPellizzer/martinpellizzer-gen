    "intro": "Billbergia nutans f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock billbergia, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, upright stems and dense rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vivid contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is particularly valued for its compact size and ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
