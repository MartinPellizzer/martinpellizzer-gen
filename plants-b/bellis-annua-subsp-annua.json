It is characterized by its white petals surrounding a yellow central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
