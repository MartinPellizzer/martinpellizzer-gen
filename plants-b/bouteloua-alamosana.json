    "intro": "Bouteloua alamosana, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale green to silver-gray leaves. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicles. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Sand dropseed is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
