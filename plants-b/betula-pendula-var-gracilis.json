    "intro": "Betula pendula var. gracilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variant of the European weeping willow. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and seasonal changes."
