    "intro": "Berberis daiana, commonly known as the Armenian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features thorny stems and small, ovate leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry garden settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both horticultural and ecological landscapes."
