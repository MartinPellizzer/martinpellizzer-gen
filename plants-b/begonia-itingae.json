    "intro": "Begonia itingae, commonly known as the Itinga begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to bronze. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
