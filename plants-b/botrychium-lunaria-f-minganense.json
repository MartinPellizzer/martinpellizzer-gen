    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria f. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the boreal forests of eastern Canada. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, moon-shaped fronds that are often folded or rolled. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found on rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
