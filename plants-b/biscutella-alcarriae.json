    "intro": "Biscutella alcarriae, commonly known as the Alcarria biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It is notable for its unique morphology, including a short, thick stem and a cluster of small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
