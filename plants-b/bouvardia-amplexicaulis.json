    "intro": "Bouvardia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the hanging bouvardia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Bouvardia amplexicaulis is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and occasional pruning to encourage bushier growth."
