These plants are characterized by their distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give them their common name. Brachymeris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to several meters. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
