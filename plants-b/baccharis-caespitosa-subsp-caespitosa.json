It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and profuse blue-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
