    "intro": "Brachystele szlachetkoana, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its short, compact trunk and fronds that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
