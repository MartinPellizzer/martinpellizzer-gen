    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. scabra, commonly known as the rough biscutella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green, hairy leaves that are rough to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name *scabra*. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
