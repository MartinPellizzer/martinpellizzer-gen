    "intro": "Begonia viscida, commonly known as the sticky begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a sticky surface, which helps in reducing water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with some species exhibiting semi-woody stems. Begonia viscida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
