It features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface, and stems that are often branched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a food source for pollinators."
