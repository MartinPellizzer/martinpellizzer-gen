    "intro": "Bridelia zanzibarensis, commonly known as Zanzibar bridelia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Bridelia zanzibarensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
