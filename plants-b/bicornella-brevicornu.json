It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive two-horned structure on its fruiting bodies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures are notable for their symmetry and specialized adaptations for spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
