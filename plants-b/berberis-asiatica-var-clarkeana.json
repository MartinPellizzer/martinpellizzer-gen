It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardy nature and ability to attract wildlife."
