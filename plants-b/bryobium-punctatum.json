It is a small, delicate moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its finely branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in tiny, translucent dots.

This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
