    "intro": "Brachystephanus myrmecophilus var. myrmecophilus, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species characterized by its specialized relationship with ants. This plant forms a mutualistic association with certain ant species, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its structure includes specialized hollow stems that serve as nesting sites for the ants. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with small, clustered leaves. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
