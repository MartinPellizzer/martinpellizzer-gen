It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
