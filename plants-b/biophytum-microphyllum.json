    "intro": "Biophytum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved biophytum, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Biophytum microphyllum is often cultivated as a houseplant or in containers due to its compact growth habit and aesthetic appeal."
