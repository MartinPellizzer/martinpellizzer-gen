    "intro": "Bertya grampiana, commonly known as the Grampian bertya, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in woodlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Bertya grampiana is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
