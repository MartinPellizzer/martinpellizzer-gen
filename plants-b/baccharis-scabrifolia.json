    "intro": "Baccharis scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for restoration projects in arid environments."
