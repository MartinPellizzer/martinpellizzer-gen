    "intro": "Benthamia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered benthamia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or white, with five petals and a distinctive tubular structure. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Benthamia minutiflora is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
