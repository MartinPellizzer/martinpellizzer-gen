    "intro": "Bassia grandis, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert environments. The plant features erect, branching stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bassia grandis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
