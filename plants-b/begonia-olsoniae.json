    "intro": "Begonia olsoniae, commonly known as the Olson's begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that display a rich mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, Begonia olsoniae is considered a rare and endangered species."
