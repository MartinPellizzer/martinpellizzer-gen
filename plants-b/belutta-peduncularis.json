    "intro": "Belutta peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy maintenance."
