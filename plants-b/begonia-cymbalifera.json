    "intro": "Begonia cymbalifera, commonly known as the cup-shaped begonia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a unique cup-like structure at the base. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia cymbalifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
