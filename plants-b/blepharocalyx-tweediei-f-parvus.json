    "intro": "Blepharocalyx tweediei f. parvus, commonly known as the dwarf starfruit tree, is a compact variant of the starfruit plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to the regular starfruit but on a smaller scale. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild tropical flavor. Due to its size, it is well-suited for container gardening and smaller spaces."
