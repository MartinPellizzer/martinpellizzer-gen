It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
