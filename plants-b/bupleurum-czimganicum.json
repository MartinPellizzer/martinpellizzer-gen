    "intro": "Bupleurum czimganicum, commonly known as the Czimgan's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
