    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subsp. botrytis, commonly known as Brussels sprouts, is a cool-season crop belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence that forms a tight cluster of small, leaf-like bracts surrounding a central flower cluster. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5 meters, with dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact head, and it produces edible buds that are harvested before they fully open. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a long growing season with consistent moisture."
