    "intro": "Baskervilla nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan baskervilla, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and along riverbanks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
