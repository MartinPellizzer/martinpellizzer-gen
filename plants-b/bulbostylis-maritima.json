    "intro": "Bulbostylis maritima, commonly known as sea bulrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as marshes and tidal flats. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Bulbostylis maritima plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
