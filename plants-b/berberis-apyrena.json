It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
