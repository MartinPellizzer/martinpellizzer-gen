    "intro": "Baccharis bakeri, commonly known as the desert baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for its purported healing properties. Baccharis bakeri plays an important role in stabilizing desert landscapes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
