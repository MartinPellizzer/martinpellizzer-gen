It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
