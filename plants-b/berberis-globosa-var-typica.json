It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact form and vibrant foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates. The berries it produces are edible but typically used in traditional medicine rather than culinary applications."
