    "intro": "Blechnum integripinnulum, commonly known as the smooth feather fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to its natural habitat."
