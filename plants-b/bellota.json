    "intro": "Bellota, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, scaly bark. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are harvested in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, turning yellow in the fall. Bellota is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional Spanish agriculture and cuisine."
