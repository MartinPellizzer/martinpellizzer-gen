    "intro": "Bellidastrum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Bellidastrum subalpinum is an important component of alpine flora, contributing to biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
