    "intro": "Berberis coryi, commonly known as the Colorado prickly pear, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Berberis coryi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
