    "intro": "Boopis agglomerata var. sanjuanina, commonly known as San Juan agglomerate, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
