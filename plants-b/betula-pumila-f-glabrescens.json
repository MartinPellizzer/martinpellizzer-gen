    "intro": "Betula pumila f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth paper birch, is a shrub-like form of the paper birch. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that lacks the flaky texture of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in northern regions of North America. This form is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
