    "intro": "Brassia signata, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Brassia signata is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
