    "intro": "Banksia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf banksia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that produces yellow or orange flowers. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Banksia obovata is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its woody base after bushfires. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly in providing nectar for honeyeaters and other pollinators."
