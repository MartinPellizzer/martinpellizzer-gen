    "intro": "Balanophora wilderi, commonly known as the wilder's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is a fully mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungal networks, which are essential for its survival. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Balanophora wilderi is considered endangered and is often difficult to locate in the wild."
