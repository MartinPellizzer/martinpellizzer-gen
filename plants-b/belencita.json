It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces edible, bean-like seeds that are often used in traditional cuisine. Belencita thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vigorous, flowering vines."
