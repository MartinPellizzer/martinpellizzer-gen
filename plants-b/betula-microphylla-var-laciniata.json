    "intro": "Betula microphylla var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its finely dissected, papery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The bark is smooth and pale, often with a bluish or white hue, and it peels in thin, papery layers. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of its native habitat."
