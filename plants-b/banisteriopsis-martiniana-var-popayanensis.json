    "intro": "Banisteriopsis martiniana var. popayanensis, commonly known as the Popayan bignay, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, round fruits with a tough, leathery outer shell. The fruit contains several seeds, which are encased in a sweet, fleshy pulp, making it a valuable food source in its native habitat."
