    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its strong, sweet scent, particularly when the bark is rubbed."
