    "intro": "Buxus cephalantha, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat shape contribute to its ornamental value in landscaping."
