    "intro": "Bombax columellatum, commonly known as the cotton tree or kapok tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like fibers from its seed pods, which are used in various traditional and commercial applications. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it can grow quite tall, reaching up to 30 meters in height. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
