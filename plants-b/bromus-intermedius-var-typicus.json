    "intro": "Bromus intermedius var. typicus, commonly known as the intermediate brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
