    "intro": "Begonia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Begonia atlantica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
