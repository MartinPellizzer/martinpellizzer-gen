    "intro": "Betula carpatica var. sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic birch, is a variant of the European birch that is native to Central Europe. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its white, peeling bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across the Czech Republic and parts of Germany. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
