    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oreogenes, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates where it grows. Bulbophyllum oreogenes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
