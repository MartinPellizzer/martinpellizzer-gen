    "intro": "Boussingaultia minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boussingaultia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
