    "intro": "Bulbophyllum comatum var. comatum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, golden-yellow inflorescence. The plant produces elongated, lance-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
