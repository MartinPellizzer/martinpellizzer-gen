    "intro": "Bouteloua scorpioides, commonly known as grama grass, is a native perennial grass found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikelets that resemble small, pinkish clouds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable component of native plant communities."
