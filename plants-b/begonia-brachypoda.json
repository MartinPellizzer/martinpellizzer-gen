    "intro": "Begonia brachypoda, commonly known as the narrowleaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening and rock gardens. Begonia brachypoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
