It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are narrow and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers are borne on slender stalks. Bauera microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in semi-shade conditions."
