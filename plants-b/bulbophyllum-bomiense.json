    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bomiense, commonly known as the Bomiense orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence consists of multiple showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
