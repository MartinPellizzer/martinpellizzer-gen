    "intro": "Bombax spectabile, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The flowers are typically pink or red, with a velvety texture and a distinctive central column. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall."
