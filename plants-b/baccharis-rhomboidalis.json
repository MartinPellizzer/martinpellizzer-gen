    "intro": "Baccharis rhomboidalis, commonly known as waxleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
