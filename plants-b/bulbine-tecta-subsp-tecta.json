    "intro": "Bulbine tecta subsp. tecta, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
