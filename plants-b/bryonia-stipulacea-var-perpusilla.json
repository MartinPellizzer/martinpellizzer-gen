    "intro": "Bryonia stipulacea var. perpusilla, commonly known as the small-leaved bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange-yellow fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for ornamental use but is of interest in botanical studies."
