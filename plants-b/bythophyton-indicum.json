    "intro": "Bythophyton indicum, commonly known as the Indian sea holly, is a marine flowering plant found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Dendrobieae and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble holly berries. The plant thrives in shallow coastal waters and is adapted to high salinity and wave action. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water currents. Despite its ornamental appearance, it plays a minor role in marine ecosystems compared to other seaweeds."
