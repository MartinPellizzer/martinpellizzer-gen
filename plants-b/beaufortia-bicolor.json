    "intro": "Beaufortia bicolor, commonly known as the pink ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the northern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with pink or red at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its bark is smooth and often has a pale or greyish hue, with a tendency to flake or peel in thin layers. Beaufortia bicolor is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
