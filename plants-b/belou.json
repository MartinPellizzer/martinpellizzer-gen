    "intro": "Belou, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its natural habitat. Belou thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorching. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
