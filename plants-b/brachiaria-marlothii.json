    "intro": "Brachiaria marlothii, commonly known as Marloth's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same spikelets. Brachiaria marlothii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
