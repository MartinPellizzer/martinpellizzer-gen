    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a small fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread B. lunaria."
