    "intro": "Bromopsis inermis subsp. pumpelliana, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
