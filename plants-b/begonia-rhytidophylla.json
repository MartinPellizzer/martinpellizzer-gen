    "intro": "Begonia rhytidophylla, commonly known as the wrinkled-leaf begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, and often variegated foliage, which adds visual interest to gardens and indoor spaces. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
