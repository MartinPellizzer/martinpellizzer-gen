    "intro": "Begonia incisa, commonly known as the serrated begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its foliage and blooms add ornamental value, and it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Begonia incisa is also valued for its ability to tolerate humid conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
