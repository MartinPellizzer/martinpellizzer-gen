    "intro": "Boleum, commonly known as the golden balm, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Boleum is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
