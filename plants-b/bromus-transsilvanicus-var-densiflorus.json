It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often found in temperate climates and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
