This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.

Its blooming period usually occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
