    "intro": "Begonia zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
