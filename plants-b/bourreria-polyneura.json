    "intro": "Bourreria polyneura, commonly known as the Mexican broom, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
