    "intro": "Bromus condensatus subsp. condensatus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous awned lemmas, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils, meadows, and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in areas with moderate to high precipitation."
