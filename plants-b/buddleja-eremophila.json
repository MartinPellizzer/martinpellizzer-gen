    "intro": "Buddleja eremophila, commonly known as the desert bush or woolly buddleia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens. Buddleja eremophila is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
