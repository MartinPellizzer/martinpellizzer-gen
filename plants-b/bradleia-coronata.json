    "intro": "Bradleia coronata, commonly known as the Crowned Bradleia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped inflorescence that resembles a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are surrounded by long, white bracts, creating a dramatic visual effect. Bradleia coronata is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many ornamental and toxic plants. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
