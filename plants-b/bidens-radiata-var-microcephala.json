It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Bidens species."
