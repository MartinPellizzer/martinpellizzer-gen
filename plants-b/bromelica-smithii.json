    "intro": "Bromelica smithii, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiky, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a flowering stem that eventually bears a fruit resembling a pineapple. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention in arid environments. Bromelica smithii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
