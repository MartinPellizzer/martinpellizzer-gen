    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves that have a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with soft, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Bromus squarrosus var. macrostachys is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
