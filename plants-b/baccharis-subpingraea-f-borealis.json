    "intro": "Baccharis subpingraea f. borealis, commonly known as the northern baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is adapted to colder climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
