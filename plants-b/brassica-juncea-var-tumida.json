    "intro": "Brassica juncea var. tumida, commonly known as the elephant head mustard, is a biennial or annual plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, inflated siliques that resemble elephant heads, which are the fruiting bodies of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a pungent odor due to the presence of glucosinolates. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental features and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
