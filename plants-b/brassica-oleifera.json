    "intro": "Brassica oleifera, commonly known as canola, is an annual flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region but is now widely cultivated in temperate climates around the world. The plant produces small yellow flowers and has dark green, lobed leaves. Canola is primarily grown for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in cooking oils, biodiesel, and food products. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a short, branching stem that supports its flowering inflorescence."
