    "intro": "Buddleja thyrsoides subsp. angusticarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruit buddleja, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract a variety of pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens. Its unique fruiting structure, with elongated, narrow capsules, distinguishes it from other species in the Buddleja genus."
