    "intro": "Bupleurum pyrenaeum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are usually pale blue or white, with four petals and five stamens. This variant is noted for its hardy nature and is often found in high-altitude environments where few other plants can survive."
