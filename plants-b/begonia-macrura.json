    "intro": "Begonia macrura, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
