    "intro": "Bauhinia microstachya, commonly known as the small-stalked bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often deeply divided into five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Bauhinia microstachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
