    "intro": "Bucida comintana, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used for erosion control due to its strong root system. Bucida comintana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
