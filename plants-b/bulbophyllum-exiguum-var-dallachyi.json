    "intro": "Bulbophyllum exiguum var. dallachyi, commonly known as the Dallachy's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features small, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-light, humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in well-draining substrates and requires high humidity and indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a prized species among orchid enthusiasts."
