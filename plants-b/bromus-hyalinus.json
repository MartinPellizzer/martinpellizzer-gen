    "intro": "Bromus hyalinus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Bromus hyalinus thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silica, giving it a distinctive appearance and contributing to its drought tolerance."
