    "intro": "Beaucarnea microcarpa, commonly known as the miniature elephant tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, twisted, and often gnarled stems that resemble the trunk of an elephant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Beaucarnea microcarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
