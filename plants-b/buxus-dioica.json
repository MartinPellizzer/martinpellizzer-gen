    "intro": "Buxus dioica, commonly known as the common boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, which is a notable botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Buxus dioica is also known for its ability to tolerate pruning, which contributes to its widespread use in ornamental landscaping."
