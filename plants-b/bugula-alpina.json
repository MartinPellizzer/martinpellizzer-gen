    "intro": "Bugula alpina, commonly known as the alpine bugula, is a species of marine bryophyte found in cold, temperate waters. It belongs to the order Bugulales and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure. The plant forms dense mats on rocky substrates, often in shallow coastal areas. Its morphology includes small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Bugula alpina plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
