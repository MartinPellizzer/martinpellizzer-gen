    "intro": "Bulbophyllum platybulbum, commonly known as the flat-bulb orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
