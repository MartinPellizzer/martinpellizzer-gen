    "intro": "Balsamina mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf balsam, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other balsam species. Balsamina mollis is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage."
