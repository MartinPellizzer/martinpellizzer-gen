    "intro": "Bothriochloa brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native range."
