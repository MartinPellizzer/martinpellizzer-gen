    "intro": "Buddleja chloroleuca, commonly known as the white-leaf buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking white to pale green leaves, which contrast with its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja chloroleuca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
