    "intro": "Bulbostylis communis, commonly known as the common bulbostylis, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in spikes. Its bulbs, which are underground storage organs, play a key role in its survival and propagation. Bulbostylis communis is typically short-lived and completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
