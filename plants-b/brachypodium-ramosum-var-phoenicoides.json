    "intro": "Brachypodium ramosum var. phoenicoides, commonly known as the flame grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, feathery inflorescences that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer. Brachypodium ramosum var. phoenicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional landscaping and as a source of forage in some regions."
