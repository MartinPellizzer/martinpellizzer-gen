    "intro": "Bulbostylis laniceps, commonly known as the woolly bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
