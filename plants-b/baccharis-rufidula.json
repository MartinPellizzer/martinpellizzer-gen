    "intro": "Baccharis rufidula, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its grayish-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis rufidula is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
