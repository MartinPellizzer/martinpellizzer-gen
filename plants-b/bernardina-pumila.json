    "intro": "Bernardina pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features hairy, basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
