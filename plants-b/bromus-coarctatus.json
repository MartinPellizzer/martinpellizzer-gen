    "intro": "Bromus coarctatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, with a rough texture. Bromus coarctatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
