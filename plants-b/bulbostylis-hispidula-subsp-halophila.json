    "intro": "Bulbostylis hispidula subsp. halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh bulbostylis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. It is well adapted to high-salinity environments, with specialized structures that help it retain water and exclude excess salt. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
