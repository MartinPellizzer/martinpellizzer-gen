    "intro": "Brodiaea douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's brodiaea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as meadows and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid conditions. Brodiaea douglasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
