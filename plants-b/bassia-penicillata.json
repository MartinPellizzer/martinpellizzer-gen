    "intro": "Bassia penicillata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Bassia penicillata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
