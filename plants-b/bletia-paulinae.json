    "intro": "Bletia paulinae, commonly known as the pink bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Bletia paulinae typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance."
