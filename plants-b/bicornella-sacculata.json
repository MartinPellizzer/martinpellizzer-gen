    "intro": "Bicornella sacculata, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with the bladders often clustered at the base of the stems. Bicornella sacculata is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
