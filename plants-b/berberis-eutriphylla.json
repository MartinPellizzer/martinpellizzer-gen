It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which turns red in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
