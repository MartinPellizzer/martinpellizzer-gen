    "intro": "Buchnera orobanchoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in woodland or heathland areas. It lacks true roots and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. Buchnera orobanchoides is known for its ephemeral blooming period, which occurs in late spring to early summer."
