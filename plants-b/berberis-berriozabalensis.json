    "intro": "Berberis berriozabalensis, commonly known as the Berriozabal barberry, is a shrub native to the Pyrenees region of Spain. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour in taste. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
