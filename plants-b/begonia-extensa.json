    "intro": "Begonia extensa, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
