    "intro": "Begonia inostegia, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with white veins that contrast sharply against its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
