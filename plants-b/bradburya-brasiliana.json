    "intro": "Bradburya brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with a contrasting purple or red center. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bradburya brasiliana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
