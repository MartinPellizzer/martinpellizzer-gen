    "intro": "Bromus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaved brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Bromus sclerophyllus is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
