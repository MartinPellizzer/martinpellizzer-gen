    "intro": "Bryonia perpusilla, commonly known as the small bryony, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, squash, and other climbing plants. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange-red berries. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by both livestock and humans."
