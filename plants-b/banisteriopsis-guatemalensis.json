    "intro": "Banisteriopsis guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan snakewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are opposite and elliptic, with a glossy green surface, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow. The tree is also notable for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
