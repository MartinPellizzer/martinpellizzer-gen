    "intro": "Boechera pinzliae, commonly known as the Pinzliae rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or arid environments. Boechera pinzliae is often found in open areas with full sun exposure, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
