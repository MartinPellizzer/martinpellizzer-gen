    "intro": "Bromus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned flowers. Bromus angustifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
