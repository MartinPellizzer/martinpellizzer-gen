    "intro": "Blechnum longifolium var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's shield fern, is a variant of the long-leaf shield fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
