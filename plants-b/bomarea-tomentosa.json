    "intro": "Bomarea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bomarea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. Bomarea tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique foliage structure."
