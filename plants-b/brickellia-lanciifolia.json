    "intro": "Brickellia lanciifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. Brickellia lanciifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
