    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass variant, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low, dense growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers, giving it its scientific name \"pauciflorus,\" meaning \"few-flowered.\" It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control but can become invasive in certain environments."
