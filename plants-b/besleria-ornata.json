    "intro": "Besleria ornata, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 3 feet. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Besleria ornata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
