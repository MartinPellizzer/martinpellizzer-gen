    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. divionensis, commonly known as the Divion Valley biscutella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
