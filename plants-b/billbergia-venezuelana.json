It is native to Venezuela and is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia venezuelana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
