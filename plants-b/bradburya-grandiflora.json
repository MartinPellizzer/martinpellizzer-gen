    "intro": "Bradburya grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bradburya, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers, which can be red, orange, or yellow, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Bradburya grandiflora is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
