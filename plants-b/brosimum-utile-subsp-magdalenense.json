It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is also valued for its latex, which has been traditionally used in the production of chewing gum and other products."
