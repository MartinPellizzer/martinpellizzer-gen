    "intro": "Bourreria aquilana, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a dense, compact growth habit with small, elliptical leaves that are leathery and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round, blue-black berries. Its thick, waxy leaves and slow growth rate make it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
