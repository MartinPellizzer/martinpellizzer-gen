    "intro": "Baptisia alba, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright blue or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. Baptisia alba is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its seeds are encased in long, cylindrical pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
