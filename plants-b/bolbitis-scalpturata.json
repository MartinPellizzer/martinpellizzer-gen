    "intro": "Bolbitis scalpturata, commonly known as the scarlet fern, is a unique member of the fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its bright red to orange fronds, which are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Bolbitis scalpturata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
