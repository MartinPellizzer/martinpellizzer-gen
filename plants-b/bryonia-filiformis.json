    "intro": "Bryonia filiformis, commonly known as the slender bryony, is a climbing plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its thin, vine-like stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
