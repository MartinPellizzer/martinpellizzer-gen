    "intro": "Bromus ornans, commonly known as the ornate brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus ornans thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
