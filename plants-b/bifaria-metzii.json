    "intro": "Bifaria metzii, commonly known as the Metzii's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Bifaria metzii is considered a conservation concern."
