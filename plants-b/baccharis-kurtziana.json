    "intro": "Baccharis kurtziana, commonly known as blue baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
