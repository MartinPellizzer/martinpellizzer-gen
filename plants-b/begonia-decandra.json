    "intro": "Begonia decandra, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce flowers throughout the growing season."
