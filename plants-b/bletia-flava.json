    "intro": "Bletia flava, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes and emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bletia flava is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth."
