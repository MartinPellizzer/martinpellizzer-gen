These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs with succulent stems and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers are usually brightly colored, with showy ray florets and tubular central cones, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Bolusanthemum species are part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by their composite flower heads and ability to thrive in poor soils. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
