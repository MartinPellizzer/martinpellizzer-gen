    "intro": "Brachypodium latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has fibrous roots and produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Brachypodium latifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
