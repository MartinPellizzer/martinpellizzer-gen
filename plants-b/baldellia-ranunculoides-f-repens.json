    "intro": "Baldellia ranunculoides f. repens, commonly known as the creeping water buttercup, is a low-growing aquatic plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spreading growth habit. It typically thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
