    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland environments, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent component of forest understories. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect life."
