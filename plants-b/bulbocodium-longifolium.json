    "intro": "Bulbocodium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved bulbocodium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that emerge from the base, and it blooms in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and careful watering to prevent root rot."
