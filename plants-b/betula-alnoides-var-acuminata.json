    "intro": "Betula alnoides var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and pale, often developing fissures as the tree matures. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
