    "intro": "Bufonia macropetala var. strohlii, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
