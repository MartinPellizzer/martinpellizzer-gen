    "intro": "Bromus paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushire grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
