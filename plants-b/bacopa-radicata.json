    "intro": "Bacopa radicata, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in the Americas. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported cognitive and calming effects. Bacopa radicata thrives in moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects."
