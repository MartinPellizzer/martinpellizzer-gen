    "intro": "Blepharodon amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its striking appearance and unique blooming pattern. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapting to the humid and shaded conditions of the rainforest. Despite its beauty, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
