    "intro": "Bouteloua bracteata, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. The plant has narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
