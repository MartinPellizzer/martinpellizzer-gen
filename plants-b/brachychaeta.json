    "intro": "Brachychaeta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody, often shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps the plant conserve water in arid environments. Brachychaeta species are native to Australia and are adapted to dry, sandy soils. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
