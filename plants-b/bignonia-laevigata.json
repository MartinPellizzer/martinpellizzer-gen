    "intro": "Bignonia laevigata, commonly known as the yellow bell vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vigorous climber with pinnately compound leaves and showy, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can become invasive in some regions."
