    "intro": "Bromus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and an invasive species in some regions."
