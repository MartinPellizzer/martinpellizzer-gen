    "intro": "Baccharis pallida, commonly known as white baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Baccharis pallida plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
