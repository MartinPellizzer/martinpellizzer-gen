    "intro": "Berzelia stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's berzelia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying shades of yellow or pale purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Berzelia stokoei is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
