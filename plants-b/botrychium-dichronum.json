    "intro": "Botrychium dichronum, commonly known as the two-timing fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique fronds that consist of a sterile, spore-bearing portion and a fertile, gamete-producing portion, which are often positioned on opposite sides of the same frond. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are released from the upper surface of the fronds, and it is found primarily in the northern hemisphere. Botrychium dichronum is a rare and often overlooked species due to its small size and subtle appearance."
