    "intro": "Baccharis tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
