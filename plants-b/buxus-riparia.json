    "intro": "Buxus riparia, commonly known as the river boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with dense, dark green foliage that remains consistent throughout the year. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, and damp woodlands. Buxus riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy, compact growth habit."
