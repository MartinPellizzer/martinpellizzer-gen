    "intro": "Berberis hookeri subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
