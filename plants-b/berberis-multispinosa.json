    "intro": "Berberis multispinosa, commonly known as the many-spined barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems that provide protection against herbivores. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Berberis multispinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
