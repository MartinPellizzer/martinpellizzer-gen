It features small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical name reflects its pale coloration and its association with aquatic habitats."
