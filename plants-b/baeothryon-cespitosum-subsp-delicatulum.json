    "intro": "Baeothryon cespitosum subsp. delicatulum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its root system forms haustoria, which attach to the roots of nearby plants to absorb water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
