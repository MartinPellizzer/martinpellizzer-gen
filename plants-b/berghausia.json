It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which can range in color from white to violet, and its preference for alpine or subalpine habitats. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. Berghausia species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to cold climates. They play an important role in pollination and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
