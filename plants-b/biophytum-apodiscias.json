    "intro": "Biophytum apodiscias, commonly known as the \"Cape plume\" or \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, red or orange bracts that resemble bottle brushes, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered at the base of the bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
