    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ecornutum var. teloense, commonly known as the Teloense Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
