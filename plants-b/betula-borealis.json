    "intro": "Betula borealis, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in full sun. Its small, triangular leaves turn yellow in the fall before dropping, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula borealis plays an important ecological role in boreal and temperate forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
