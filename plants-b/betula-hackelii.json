    "intro": "Betula hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a pale yellow-green underside. It produces small, catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that disperse via wind. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
