    "intro": "Begonia urophylla, commonly known as the upright begonia, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to pink. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce abundant blooms throughout the growing season."
