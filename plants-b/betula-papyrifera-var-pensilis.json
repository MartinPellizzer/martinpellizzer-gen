    "intro": "Betula papyrifera var. pensilis, commonly known as the eastern paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a papery, fibrous layer beneath. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
