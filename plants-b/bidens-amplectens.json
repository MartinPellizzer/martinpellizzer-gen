It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that often have a rough texture. The plant produces small yellow flowers with two white petals, which are typically clustered in groups of two. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a structure that aids in wind dispersal. Bidens amplectens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats."
