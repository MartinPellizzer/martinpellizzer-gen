    "intro": "Bugula genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva seaapple, is a species of marine bryozoan found in shallow coastal waters. It forms dense colonies that resemble small, rounded bushes, often attached to rocky substrates. The colonies are composed of numerous tiny, calcareous zooids that are interconnected by a network of channels. Each zooid has a lophophore, a crown of ciliated tentacles used for filter feeding. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of intertidal zones."
