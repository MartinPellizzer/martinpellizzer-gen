    "intro": "Bruea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Bruea species are characterized by their fleshy, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Bruea hirta and Bruea macrophylla, which are popular for their ornamental value."
