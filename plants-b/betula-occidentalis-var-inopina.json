    "intro": "Betula occidentalis var. inopina, commonly known as the western birch or white birch, is a rare variant of the white birch species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, papery white to grayish-brown leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, winged seeds enclosed in a cupule, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in open forests. This variant is noted for its unique bark texture and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
