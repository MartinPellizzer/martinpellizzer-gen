    "intro": "Betula davurica var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
