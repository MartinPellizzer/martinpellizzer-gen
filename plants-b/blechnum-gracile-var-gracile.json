    "intro": "Blechnum gracile var. gracile, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds."
