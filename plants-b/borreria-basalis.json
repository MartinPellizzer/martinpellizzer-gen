    "intro": "Borreria basalis, commonly known as whiteflower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. It often grows on other plants, drawing nutrients and water from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. Borreria basalis is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
