    "intro": "Barleria glandulostamina subsp. pseudohumilis, commonly known as the slender barleria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually pubescent. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, with small, tubular blooms that are often pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more delicate appearance compared to other barleria species."
