    "intro": "Baccharoides calvoana subsp. ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as Ruwenzori baccharis, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly around the Rwenzori Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
