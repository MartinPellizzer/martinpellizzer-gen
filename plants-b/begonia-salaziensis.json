    "intro": "Begonia salaziensis, commonly known as the Salazian begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often with a distinctive orange or yellow base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in tropical gardens."
