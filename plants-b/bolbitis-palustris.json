    "intro": "Bolbitis palustris, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis palustris plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland environment."
