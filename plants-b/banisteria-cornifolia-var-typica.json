    "intro": "Banisteria cornifolia var. typica, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas. The flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
