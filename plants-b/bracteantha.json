    "intro": "Bracteantha, commonly known as the rainbow flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, often resembling butterflies or other insects. Bracteantha species typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them store water and survive in dry conditions. These plants are popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
