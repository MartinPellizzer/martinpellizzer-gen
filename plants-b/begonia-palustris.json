    "intro": "Begonia palustris, commonly known as the marsh begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
