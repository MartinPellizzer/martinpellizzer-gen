    "intro": "Banksia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain banksia, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that are typically orange to yellow in color. The plant grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces woody cones that contain the seeds. Banksia oreophila is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat."
