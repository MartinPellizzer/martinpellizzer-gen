    "intro": "Baccharis scopulorum, commonly known as cliff baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky, coastal habitats and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh, arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for xeriscaping in coastal landscapes."
