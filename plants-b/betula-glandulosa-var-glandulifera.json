    "intro": "Betula glandulosa var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. The species is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant in harsh conditions."
