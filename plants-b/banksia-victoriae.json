    "intro": "Banksia victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain the seeds, which are released after a fire, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Banksia victoriae is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of the region and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife."
