    "intro": "Blechnum unguiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Blechnum unguiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
