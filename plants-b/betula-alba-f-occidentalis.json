It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and pale yellowish-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. This form thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in gardens and parks."
