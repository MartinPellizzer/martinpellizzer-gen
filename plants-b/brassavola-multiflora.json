    "intro": "Brassavola multiflora, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant produces numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Brassavola multiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique, sweetly scented blooms."
