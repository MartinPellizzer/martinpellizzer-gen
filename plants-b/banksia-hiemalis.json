    "intro": "Banksia hiemalis, commonly known as the winter banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cone-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Banksia hiemalis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
