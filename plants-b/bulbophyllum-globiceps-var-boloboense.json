    "intro": "Bulbophyllum globiceps var. boloboense, commonly known as the Boloboense Pterostylis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
