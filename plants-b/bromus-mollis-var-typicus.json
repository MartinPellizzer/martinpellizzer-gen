    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. typicus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle-like inflorescence, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Bromus mollis var. typicus is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control."
