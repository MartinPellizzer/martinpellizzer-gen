    "intro": "Betula procurva subsp. sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian birch, is a cold-hardy deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, pale bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are elliptic, doubly serrate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
