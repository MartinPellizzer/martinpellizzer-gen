    "intro": "Betula latifolia var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a cuneiform shape, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces white, paper-like bark that peels in thin layers, a feature common to many birch species. Its leaves are alternate and typically have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
