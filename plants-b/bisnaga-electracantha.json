It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
