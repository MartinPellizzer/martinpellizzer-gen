    "intro": "Bromus asper var. cristatus, commonly known as the hairy brome or cristate brome, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with the lower bracts being longer than the upper ones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
