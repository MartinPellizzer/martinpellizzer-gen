    "intro": "Buddleja saligna, commonly known as the silverleaf buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces panicles of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja saligna is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
