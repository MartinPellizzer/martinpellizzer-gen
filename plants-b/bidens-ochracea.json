    "intro": "Bidens ochracea, commonly known as yellow beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early fall, and the plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens ochracea is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for pollinators."
