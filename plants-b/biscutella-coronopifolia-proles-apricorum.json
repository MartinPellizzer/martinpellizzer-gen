    "intro": "Biscutella coronopifolia proles apricorum, commonly known as the apricot-leaved biscuitroot, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent odors. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation with leaves resembling those of apricot trees, featuring a lobed structure and a hairy surface. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
