    "intro": "Barringtonia seaturae, commonly known as the sea turtle tree, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The tree has a smooth, greyish bark and produces a fleshy, orange-colored fruit that contains numerous seeds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, providing shade in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline, making it well adapted to coastal environments."
