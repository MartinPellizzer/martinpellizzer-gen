    "intro": "Belangera denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive toothed edge along the petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Belangera denticulata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
