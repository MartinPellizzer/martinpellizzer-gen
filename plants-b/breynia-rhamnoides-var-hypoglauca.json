    "intro": "Breynia rhamnoides var. hypoglauca, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glaucous foliage that gives it a silvery appearance. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This plant is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
