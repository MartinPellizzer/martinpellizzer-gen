    "intro": "Botryothallus, commonly known as the \"buttercup lichen,\" is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, typically from the genus Peltigera. The thallus is usually bright yellow to orange in color, with a smooth or slightly lobed surface. It often grows on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. Botryothallus is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
