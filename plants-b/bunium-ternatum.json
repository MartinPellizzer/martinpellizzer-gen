    "intro": "Bunium ternatum, commonly known as three-lobed fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a mild anise-like scent. Its small white or yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Bunium ternatum is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating digestive issues and respiratory ailments."
