    "intro": "Bromus burkartii, commonly known as Burkart's brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to cold and arid conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Bromus burkartii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
