    "intro": "Brachystegia, commonly known as the African brachystegia or knobthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in woodland and savanna ecosystems. They are characterized by their thick, often flaky bark and small, clustered leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or white, and the fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds. Brachystegia species are important for their role in soil stabilization and as a source of timber and forage."
