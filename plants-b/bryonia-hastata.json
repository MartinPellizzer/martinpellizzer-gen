    "intro": "Bryonia hastata, commonly known as the prickly sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
