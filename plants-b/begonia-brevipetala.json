    "intro": "Begonia brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petioled begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and silver. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warm seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
