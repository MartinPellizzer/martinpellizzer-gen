    "intro": "Brasolia mutisii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, often purple or white blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brasolia mutisii is considered a rare and endangered species."
