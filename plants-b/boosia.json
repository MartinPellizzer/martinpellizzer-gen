    "intro": "Boosia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale violet petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Its unique appearance has made it a subject of fascination among botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, boosia is considered a vulnerable species."
