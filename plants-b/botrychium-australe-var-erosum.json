    "intro": "Botrychium australe var. erosum, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a fern-like plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a ring near the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
