    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. minor, commonly known as dwarf blite, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
