    "intro": "Blechnum brevifolium f. semidecurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds of this fern are semi-decurrent, meaning they extend partially down the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates."
