    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aureoapex, commonly known as the golden-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-tipped flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
