    "intro": "Biota japonica, commonly known as the Japanese spider plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both shady and sunny conditions. Biota japonica is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
