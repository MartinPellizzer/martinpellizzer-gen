It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
