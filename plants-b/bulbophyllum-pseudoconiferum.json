    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pseudoconiferum, commonly known as the false pine orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique appearance."
