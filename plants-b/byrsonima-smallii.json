    "intro": "Byrsonima smallii, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are toxic, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
