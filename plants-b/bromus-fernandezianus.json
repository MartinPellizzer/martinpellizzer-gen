    "intro": "Bromus fernandezianus, commonly known as the Fernandez's brome, is a grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils, often in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are wind-pollinated. Bromus fernandezianus plays a minor ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for local wildlife."
