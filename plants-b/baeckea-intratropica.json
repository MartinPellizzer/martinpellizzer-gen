    "intro": "Baeckea intratropica, commonly known as the tropical baeckea, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Baeckea intratropica is well adapted to its environment, showing resilience to drought and high temperatures."
