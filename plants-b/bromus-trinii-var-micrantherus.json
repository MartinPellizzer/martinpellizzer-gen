    "intro": "Bromus trinii var. micrantherus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in temperate climates."
