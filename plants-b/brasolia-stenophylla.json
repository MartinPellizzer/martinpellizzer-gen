    "intro": "Brasolia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or purple. Brasolia stenophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in dense undergrowth."
