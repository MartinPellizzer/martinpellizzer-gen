    "intro": "Berberis nevinii var. haematocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed barberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems, which are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into the winter. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
