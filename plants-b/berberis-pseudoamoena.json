It features thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The berries are toxic to humans and livestock, so care should be taken when handling or consuming them."
