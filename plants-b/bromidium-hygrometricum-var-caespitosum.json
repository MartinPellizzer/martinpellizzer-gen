    "intro": "Bromidium hygrometricum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the woolly bromeliad, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to South America. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water, which is essential for survival in its native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color."
