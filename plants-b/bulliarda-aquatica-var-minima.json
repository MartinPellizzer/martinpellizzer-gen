It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This variety thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to both air and water, adapting to fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. The plant's structure is composed of a central axis with branching fronds, and it reproduces through the release of spores. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
