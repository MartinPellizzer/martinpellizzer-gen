    "intro": "Brachystelma mahendragiriense, commonly known as the Mahendragiri starling cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's tropical and subtropical climate. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in arid conditions. This species is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
