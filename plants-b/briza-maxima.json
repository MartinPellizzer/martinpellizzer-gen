    "intro": "Briza maxima, commonly known as quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, slender blades that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Briza maxima is often found in meadows, streambanks, and other open, sunny habitats."
