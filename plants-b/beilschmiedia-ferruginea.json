    "intro": "Beilschmiedia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a reddish-brown underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are orange to red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth rate."
