    "intro": "Bromopsis alpina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Bromopsis alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments."
