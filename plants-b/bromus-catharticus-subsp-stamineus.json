    "intro": "Bromus catharticus subsp. stamineus, commonly known as the stamen brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage, it is an important component of its native ecosystem."
