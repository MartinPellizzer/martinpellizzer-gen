    "intro": "Begonia palmata, commonly known as the palmate begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately divided leaves that resemble the shape of a palm tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from both its striking foliage and its vibrant floral display."
