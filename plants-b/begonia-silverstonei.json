    "intro": "Begonia silverstonei, commonly known as the silver stone begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its foliage is notable for its striking silver-gray coloration, which helps reflect sunlight in its native habitat. Begonia silverstonei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and partial shade."
