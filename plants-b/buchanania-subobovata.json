    "intro": "Buchanania subobovata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
