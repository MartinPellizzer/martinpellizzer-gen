    "intro": "Bassia astrocarpa, commonly known as sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Bassia astrocarpa is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
