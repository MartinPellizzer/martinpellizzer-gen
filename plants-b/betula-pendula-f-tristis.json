    "intro": "Betula pendula f. tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like hair. It is a naturally occurring form of the European white poplar, featuring long, pendulous twigs that create a distinctive, flowing silhouette. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a popular choice for landscaping. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shade and habitat for wildlife."
