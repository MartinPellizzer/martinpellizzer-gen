    "intro": "Bromus runssoroensis, commonly known as the Runssoro grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, typical of the Bromus genus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bromus runssoroensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
