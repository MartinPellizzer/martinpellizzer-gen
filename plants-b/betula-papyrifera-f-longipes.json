    "intro": "Betula papyrifera f. longipes, commonly known as the longstem paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its elongated stems and distinctive white bark. This form is native to the western United States and grows in high-elevation environments, often in mountainous regions. It is a deciduous tree that produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The bark, which peels in thin layers, is a notable feature used in traditional crafts and for identifying the species. Its growth habit and morphology make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
