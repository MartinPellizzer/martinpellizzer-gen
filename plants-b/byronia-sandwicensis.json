The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, often near streams or in rocky habitats. It has distinctive yellowish-green stems and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
