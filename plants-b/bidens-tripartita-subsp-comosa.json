    "intro": "Bidens tripartita subsp. comosa, commonly known as the hairy beggar\u2019s ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive three-lobed shape, typical of the genus Bidens. The plant produces small yellow flowers with ray florets, often accompanied by bracts that give it a prickly appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Its seeds are dispersed by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals, aiding in its spread."
