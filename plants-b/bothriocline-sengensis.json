    "intro": "Bothriocline sengensis, commonly known as the Sengeni bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
