    "intro": "Bauhinia dioscoreifolia, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, and its flowers are clustered in racemes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia dioscoreifolia also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil."
