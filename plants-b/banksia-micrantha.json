    "intro": "Banksia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered banksia, is a striking Australian shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the leaf axils, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain up to 100 seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Banksia micrantha is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the local flora."
