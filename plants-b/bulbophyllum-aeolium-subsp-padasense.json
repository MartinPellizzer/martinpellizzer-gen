    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aeolium subsp. padasense, commonly known as the Padasen's ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, with a slender, wiry stem and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are often pollinated by specific insects. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
