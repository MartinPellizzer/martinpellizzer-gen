    "intro": "Bulbophyllum serripetalum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and sharply lobed leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for collectors and horticultural enthusiasts."
