    "intro": "Bahia nudicaulis var. ourolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bahia grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for coastal and sandy environments. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use in landscapes."
