    "intro": "Bletia riparia, commonly known as the river orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Bletia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
