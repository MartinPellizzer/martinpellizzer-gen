    "intro": "Biarum haenseleri, commonly known as the Haenseler's bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle purple hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cooler, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Biarum haenseleri is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservationists."
