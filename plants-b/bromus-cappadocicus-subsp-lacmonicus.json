    "intro": "Bromus cappadocicus subsp. lacmonicus, commonly known as the Cappadocian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
