    "intro": "Begonia crockerensis, commonly known as the Crocker's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the forests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to vibrant red. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
