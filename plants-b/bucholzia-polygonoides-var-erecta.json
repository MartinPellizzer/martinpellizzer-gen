It is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
