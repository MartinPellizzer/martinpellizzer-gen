    "intro": "Bouteloua barbata var. arenosa, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, pale green to brown seeds. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
