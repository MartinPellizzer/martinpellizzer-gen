    "intro": "Biscutella didyma var. lyrata, commonly known as the lyrated biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive, fleshy root system that stores nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in arid environments. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
