    "intro": "Billotia flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Billotia flexuosa is often found growing in clusters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem."
