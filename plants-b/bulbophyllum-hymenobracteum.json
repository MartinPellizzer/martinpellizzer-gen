    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hymenobracteum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a lip-shaped structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
