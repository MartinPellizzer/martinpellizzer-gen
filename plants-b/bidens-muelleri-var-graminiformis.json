It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or linear fashion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two ray florets, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
