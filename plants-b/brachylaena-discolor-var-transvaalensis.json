    "intro": "Brachylaena discolor var. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal brachylaena, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its unique appearance."
