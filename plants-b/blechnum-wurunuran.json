    "intro": "Blechnum wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark or rock surfaces in its natural habitat. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance with a leathery texture. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
