    "intro": "Briza media f. pumila, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of slender, silver-green leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences of pale blue to purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and soft foliage, which adds texture to garden landscapes."
