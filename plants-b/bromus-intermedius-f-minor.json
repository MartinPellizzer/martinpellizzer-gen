    "intro": "Bromus intermedius f. minor, commonly known as the lesser intermediate brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
