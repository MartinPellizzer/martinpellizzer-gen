    "intro": "Betula alnus subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky birch, is a subspecies of the white birch native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that exudes a sticky resin when damaged, which is a distinguishing feature. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The subspecies produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often found in forested areas."
