    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy bromus, is a grass species characterized by its hairy, dense foliage and compact growth habit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
