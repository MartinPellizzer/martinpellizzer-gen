It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional Aboriginal practices. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and public spaces."
