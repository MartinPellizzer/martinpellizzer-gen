It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat. Buena lambertiana is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local wildlife."
