    "intro": "Bassia quinquecuspis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Bassia quinquecuspis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
