    "intro": "Brossaea roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sun-cup, is a rare and unique plant endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble miniature suns. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the rocky plateaus, relying on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes a short stem with a single, cup-shaped flower that opens during the day. Due to its restricted habitat and fragile ecosystem, Brossaea roraimae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human encroachment."
