    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. simaczevae, commonly known as the Simaczev's bromus, is a grass species native to specific regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
