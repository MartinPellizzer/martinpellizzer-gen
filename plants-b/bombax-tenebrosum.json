    "intro": "Bombax tenebrosum, commonly known as the dark cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The tree has a straight trunk with smooth, greyish bark and produces fibrous, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, adapting to humid and shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
