    "intro": "Bulnesia, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Bulnesia species are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive due to their drought-resistant adaptations. These plants are also valued for their hardy nature and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
