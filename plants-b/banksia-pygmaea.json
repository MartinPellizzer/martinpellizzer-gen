It is characterized by its striking yellow flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves and produces woody cones that persist on the plant for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and dry forest habitats. Banksia pygmaea is an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for birds and insects."
