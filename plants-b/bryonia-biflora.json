    "intro": "Bryonia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bryony, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, followed by spiny, orange-red fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and is more commonly found in wild, undisturbed areas."
