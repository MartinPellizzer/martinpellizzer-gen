    "intro": "Bellevalia crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and grayish-green in appearance. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive tubular throat, which is characteristic of the Campanulaceae family. Bellevalia crassa is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a hardy species often found in Mediterranean climates."
