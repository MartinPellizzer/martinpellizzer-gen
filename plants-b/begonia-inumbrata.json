    "intro": "Begonia inumbrata, commonly known as the shadow begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It features velvety, dark green leaves with a distinctive light green or white midrib, creating a striking contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden spaces."
