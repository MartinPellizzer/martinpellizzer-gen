It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in intertidal zones. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Beringeria acetabulosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations."
