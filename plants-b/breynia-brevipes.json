    "intro": "Breynia brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf breynia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Breynia brevipes is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
