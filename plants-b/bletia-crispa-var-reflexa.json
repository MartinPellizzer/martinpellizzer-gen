    "intro": "Bletia crispa var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bletia, is a perennial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths."
