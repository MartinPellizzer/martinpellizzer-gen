    "intro": "Brachystephanus nimbae, commonly known as the Nimba stephanus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Nimba Mountains in southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape and are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Brachystephanus nimbae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
