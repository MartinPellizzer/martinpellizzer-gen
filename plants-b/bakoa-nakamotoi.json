    "intro": "Bakoa nakamotoi, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on cliffs or in rocky crevices, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Bakoa nakamotoi is considered a critically endangered species."
