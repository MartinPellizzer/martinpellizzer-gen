    "intro": "Bufonia paniculata subsp. teneriffae, commonly known as the Canary Islands milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in panicles, which are inflorescences that branch out in a loose, open pattern. It is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of the Canary Islands, showing resistance to salt spray and drought. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
