    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. megacarpaea, commonly known as the broad-fruited biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to parts of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its fruits are notable for their large size and thick walls, which aid in seed dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
