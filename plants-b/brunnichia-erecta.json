It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in moist, tundra habitats and has small, green, ovate leaves. Its flowers are white or pale yellow and are arranged in racemes, producing small, round pods that contain the seeds. Brunnichia erecta is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment."
