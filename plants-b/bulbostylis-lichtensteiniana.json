It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
