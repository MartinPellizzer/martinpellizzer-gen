    "intro": "Begonia burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's begonia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
