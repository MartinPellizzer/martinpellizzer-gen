    "intro": "Banksia ilicifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as the soft leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, depending on the stage of flowering. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a slightly wavy margin. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal and sandy environments. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly honeyeaters and other nectar-feeding birds."
