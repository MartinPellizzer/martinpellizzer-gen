    "intro": "Bicornella anacamptoides, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that coil tightly in a helical pattern, giving it a distinctive spiral appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Bicornella anacamptoides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
