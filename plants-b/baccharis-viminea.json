    "intro": "Baccharis viminea, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer. Baccharis viminea is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
