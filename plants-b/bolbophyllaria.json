    "intro": "Bolbophyllaria, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth form, with leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having structures called thallus, which absorb water and nutrients directly. Bolbophyllaria thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its simple morphology and ecological role make it an important component of moist forest floor ecosystems."
