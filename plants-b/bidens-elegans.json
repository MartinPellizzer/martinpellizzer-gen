    "intro": "Bidens elegans, commonly known as the elegant tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinctive seed structure known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens elegans is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
