    "intro": "Biebersteinia rucheri, commonly known as the St. Helena biebersteinia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. Due to its restricted habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to extinction. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this rare botanical species."
