It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which allows it to survive harsh winter conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural habitats."
