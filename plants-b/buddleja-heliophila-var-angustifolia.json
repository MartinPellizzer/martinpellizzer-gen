    "intro": "Buddleja heliophila var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false dragonhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
