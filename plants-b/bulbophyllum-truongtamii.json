    "intro": "Bulbophyllum truongtamii, commonly known as the Truong Tam orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
