    "intro": "Baccharis multiflora, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the fall, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Baccharis multiflora is also valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
