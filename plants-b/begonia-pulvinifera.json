    "intro": "Begonia pulvinifera, commonly known as the cushion begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit, with fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. Its unique pulvini, or swollen nodes at the base of the leaves, aid in water storage and drought tolerance. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
