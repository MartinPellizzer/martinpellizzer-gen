    "intro": "Bromelia sphacelata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America. It features a rosette of long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating. The plant produces a tall flower stalk topped with vibrant orange or red bracts, which are actually modified leaves. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Bromelia sphacelata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
