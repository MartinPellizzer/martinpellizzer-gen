    "intro": "Bifrenaria secunda, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single flower spike with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bifrenaria secunda is considered a rare and endangered species."
