    "intro": "Bacopa tenella, commonly known as smallleaf water bead, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Bacopa tenella thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, which helps it survive in humid, tropical climates."
