It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a visually appealing and sought-after ornamental plant."
