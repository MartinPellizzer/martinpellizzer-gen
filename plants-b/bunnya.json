    "intro": "Bunnya, commonly known as *Bunia* or *Bunya pine*, is a genus of coniferous trees native to Australia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive cone structures. The leaves are typically needle-like, and the trees can grow to significant heights, often reaching over 30 meters. Bunya trees produce large, edible seeds that are a traditional food source for Indigenous Australians. These plants are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native ecosystems."
