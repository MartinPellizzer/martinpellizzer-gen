It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of multiple pairs of small leaflets. Bauhinia diptera thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its flowers are not only visually striking but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
