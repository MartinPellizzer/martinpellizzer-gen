    "intro": "Betula alba var. fragilis, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silvery inner layer, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are triangular with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
