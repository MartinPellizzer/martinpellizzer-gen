    "intro": "Braya glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth braya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a dense covering of fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Braya glaberrima is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
