    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often longer than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration ecology."
