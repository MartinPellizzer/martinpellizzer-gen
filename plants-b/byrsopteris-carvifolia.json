    "intro": "Byrsopteris carvifolia, commonly known as the serrated cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on cliffs or in open woodlands. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fertile fronds."
