It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy as well. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
