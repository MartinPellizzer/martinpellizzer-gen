It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. Berberis calamicaulis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
