    "intro": "Boehmeria waitziana, commonly known as giant arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are used to produce a starchy root crop similar to taro and arrowroot. The plant is valued for both its culinary uses and its role in traditional medicine."
