    "intro": "Buddleja axillaris, commonly known as the rock buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
