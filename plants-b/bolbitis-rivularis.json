    "intro": "Bolbitis rivularis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Bolbitis rivularis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
