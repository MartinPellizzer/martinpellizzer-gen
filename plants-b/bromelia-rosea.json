    "intro": "Bromelia rosea, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, red-pink bracts that surround its flowering spikes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in the center of the leaf rosette. Bromelia rosea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
