    "intro": "Barbosella tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima barbosella, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture, while its flowers are white or pale pink, often with a red calyx. Barbosella tolimensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
