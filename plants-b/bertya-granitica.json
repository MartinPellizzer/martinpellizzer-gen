    "intro": "Bertya granitica, commonly known as the granite bertya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Bertya granitica is often found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils."
