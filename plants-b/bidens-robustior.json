    "intro": "Bidens robustior, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Bidens robustior is often found in moist habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
