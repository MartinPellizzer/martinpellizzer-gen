    "intro": "Bidens xantiana, commonly known as yellow beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
