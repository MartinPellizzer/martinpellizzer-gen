    "intro": "Brachyscome radicans, commonly known as the creeping daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense carpets. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Brachyscome radicans is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
