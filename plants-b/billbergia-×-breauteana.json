    "intro": "Billbergia \u00d7 breauteana, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is a hybrid between Billbergia nana and Billbergia zebrina, resulting in a plant with vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a micro-ecosystem. Its foliage is often variegated with red, orange, and yellow hues, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
