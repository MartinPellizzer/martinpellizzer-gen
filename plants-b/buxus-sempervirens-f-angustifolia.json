    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with a narrow, elongated shape that distinguishes it from other boxwood varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a compact form make it ideal for formal garden designs."
