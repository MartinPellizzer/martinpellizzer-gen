    "intro": "Begonia repens, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, glossy, and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom from spring to autumn. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and ground cover."
