    "intro": "Brachiaria platynota, commonly known as the flat-leaf signal grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Brachiaria platynota is valued for its forage quality and is used in pasture systems in many parts of the world."
