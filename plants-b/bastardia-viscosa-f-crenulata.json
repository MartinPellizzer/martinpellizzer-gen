    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa f. crenulata, commonly known as the sticky bastardia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological resilience in harsh environments."
