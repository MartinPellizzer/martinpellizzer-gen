    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ovale, commonly known as the oval orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects."
