    "intro": "Berberis globularis, commonly known as the globe barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. The plant has thick, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for use in jams and jellies."
