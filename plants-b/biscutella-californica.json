    "intro": "Biscutella californica, commonly known as California biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense mat, contributing to soil stabilization. Biscutella californica is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a hardy species found in coastal and inland regions."
