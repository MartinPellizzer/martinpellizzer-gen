    "intro": "Buchnera foliosa, commonly known as the leafy buchnera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dry, capsule-like fruits. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas."
