    "intro": "Brassia glumacea, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Brassia glumacea is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
