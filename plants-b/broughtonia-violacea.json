    "intro": "Broughtonia violacea, commonly known as the violet starflower, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps collect and retain moisture. Broughtonia violacea is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
