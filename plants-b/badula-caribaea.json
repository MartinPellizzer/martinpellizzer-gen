    "intro": "Badula caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its straight-grained, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing flat, elongated seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
