    "intro": "Begonia involucrata, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and delicate floral display."
