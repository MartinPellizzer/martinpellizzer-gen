    "intro": "Berberis grodtmanniana var. flavoramea, commonly known as the fragrant barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant foliage and seasonal color changes."
