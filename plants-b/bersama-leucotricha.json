    "intro": "Bersama leucotricha, commonly known as the silver-haired fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the family Blechnaceae."
