    "intro": "Bursera crenata, commonly known as the Mexican gum tree or chilacayote, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resins. The plant typically has smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in tiny white hairs. Its small yellow flowers are followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Bursera crenata is adapted to dry, tropical climates and is often found in rocky or limestone soils."
