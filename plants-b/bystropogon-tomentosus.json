    "intro": "Bystropogon tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in its native range. It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating of white or gray hairs, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Bystropogon tomentosus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
