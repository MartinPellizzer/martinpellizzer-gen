    "intro": "Begonia leathermaniae, commonly known as the leatherleaf begonia, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name, which are often a deep green with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanists."
