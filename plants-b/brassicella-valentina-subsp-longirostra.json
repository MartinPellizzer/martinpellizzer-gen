    "intro": "[WRONG START] Brassica valentina subsp. longirostra, commonly known as the long-beaked mustard, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, preferring well-drained soils.

Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
