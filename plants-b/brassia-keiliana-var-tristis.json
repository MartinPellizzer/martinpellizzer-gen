It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that display a range of colors from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its botanical features include long, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
