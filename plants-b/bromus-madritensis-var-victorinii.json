It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
