    "intro": "Blechnum antillanum, commonly known as the Antillean holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
