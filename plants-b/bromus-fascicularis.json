    "intro": "Bromus fascicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus fascicularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
