    "intro": "Betula friesii var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine birch, is a variant of the birch tree native to high-altitude regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval to triangular, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. This variety is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
