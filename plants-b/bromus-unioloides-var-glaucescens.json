    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained, nutrient-poor environments."
