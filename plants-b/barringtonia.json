    "intro": "Barringtonia, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble candles, often with a distinct central stem surrounded by bracts. The flowers are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The fruit is a woody, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Barringtonia species are native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific and are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
