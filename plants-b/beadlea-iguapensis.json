It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and prefers moist, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in yellow or orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
