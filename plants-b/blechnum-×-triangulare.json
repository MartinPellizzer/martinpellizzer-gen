    "intro": "Blechnum \u00d7 triangulare, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Blechnum capillipes and Blechnum sitchourense. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped fronds, which are typically glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking ornamental plant."
