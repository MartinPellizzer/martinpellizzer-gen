    "intro": "Blechnum polystichoides, commonly known as the fern tree or royal fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with a distinctive, dense, and feathery appearance. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a compact, overlapping pattern. Blechnum polystichoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
