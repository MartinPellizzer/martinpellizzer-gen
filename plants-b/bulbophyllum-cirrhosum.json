    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cirrhosum, commonly known as the curling lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, curling lip that resembles a lip-shaped appendage, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinctively shaped column. Bulbophyllum cirrhosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
