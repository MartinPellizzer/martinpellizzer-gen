    "intro": "Berberis barkamensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre barberry, is a shrub native to Mexico. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark contains berberine, a compound with medicinal properties, making it of interest in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
