    "intro": "Bonnetia petiolaris, commonly known as the coastal bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a spreading growth habit that helps stabilize sand dunes. Bonnetia petiolaris is adapted to salt-laden winds and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
