    "intro": "Brotobroma, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that grow from a bulbous base, typical of many bulbous plants. Brotobroma thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique, spider-like appearance, which makes it a standout in floral arrangements."
