    "intro": "Bertolonia marmorata var. genuina, commonly known as the marble fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, feathery fronds that display a marbled pattern of light and dark green. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections. It is relatively low-maintenance once established, making it suitable for both garden beds and container cultivation."
