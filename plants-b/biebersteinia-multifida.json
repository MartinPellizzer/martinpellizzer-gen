    "intro": "Biebersteinia multifida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Biebersteinia multifida is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects."
