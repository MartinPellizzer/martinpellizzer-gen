    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its morphological variability, which has led to confusion in its classification and identification."
