    "intro": "Bulbinella nutans subsp. turfosicola, commonly known as the turfy bulbinella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in heathlands or open forests. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
