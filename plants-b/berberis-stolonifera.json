    "intro": "Berberis stolonifera, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, with a glossy green upper surface. Berberis stolonifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
