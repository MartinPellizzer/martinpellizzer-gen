    "intro": "Baccharis humifusa, commonly known as dwarf baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 feet and features dense, mat-forming foliage that helps prevent soil erosion. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in panicles during the late summer to early fall. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Baccharis humifusa is often found in sandy soils along coastal areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
