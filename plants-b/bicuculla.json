It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that resemble fluffy, white or yellowish silk floss. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Bicuculla species are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their showy blooms and unique appearance."
