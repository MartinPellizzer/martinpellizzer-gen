    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Bromus mutabilis var. glabratus is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
