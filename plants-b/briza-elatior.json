    "intro": "Briza elatior, commonly known as the tall quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feathery panicles that sway in the wind, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Briza elatior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
