    "intro": "Buddleja venenifera, commonly known as the toxic buddleia, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxicity, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
