    "intro": "Berberis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in horticulture and traditional medicine."
