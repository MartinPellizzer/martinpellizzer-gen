It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
