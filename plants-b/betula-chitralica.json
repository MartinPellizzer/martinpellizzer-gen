    "intro": "Betula chitralica, commonly known as the Chitral birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark, which is often peeling in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. This species is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
