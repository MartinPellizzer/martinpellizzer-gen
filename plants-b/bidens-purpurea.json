    "intro": "Bidens purpurea, commonly known as purple beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, hairy, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bracts that resemble small ticks, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Bidens purpurea is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
