It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which become less prominent in the variety glareosa. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
