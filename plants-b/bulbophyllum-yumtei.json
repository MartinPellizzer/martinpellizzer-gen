    "intro": "Bulbophyllum yumtei, commonly known as the Yumtei Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers are often short-lived but are produced in clusters, making it a striking addition to orchid collections."
