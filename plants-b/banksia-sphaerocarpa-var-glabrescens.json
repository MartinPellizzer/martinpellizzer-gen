    "intro": "Banksia sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or spherical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of whitish or greyish hairs. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other banksia species, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region."
