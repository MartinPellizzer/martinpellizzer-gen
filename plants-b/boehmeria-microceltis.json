    "intro": "Boehmeria microceltis, commonly known as the small-cell Boehmeria, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature known as monoecious. Boehmeria microceltis is valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been traditionally used in papermaking and textile production."
