    "intro": "Bromelia ferox, commonly known as the fierce bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from red to orange, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of moss-like material, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bromelia ferox is well adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rainforests."
