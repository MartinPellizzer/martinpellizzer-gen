    "intro": "Belvisia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern belvisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
