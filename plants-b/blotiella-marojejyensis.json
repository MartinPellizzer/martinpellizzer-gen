    "intro": "Blotiella marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant endemic to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters and thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes small, floating leaves and specialized glands for trapping microorganisms. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
