    "intro": "Brachystegia fischeri, commonly known as Fischer's brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical woodlands of central and eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters, with a dense canopy and a trunk that is often buttressed at the base. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to seasonal climates, shedding its leaves during the dry season to conserve water."
