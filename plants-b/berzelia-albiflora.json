    "intro": "Berzelia albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower berzelia, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to its harsh environment through deep root systems and a thick waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. Its foliage consists of narrow, needle-like leaves that help minimize surface area and evaporation. Berzelia albiflora is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun and low moisture conditions."
