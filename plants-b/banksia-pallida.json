    "intro": "Banksia pallida, commonly known as the pale banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant belongs to the Proteaceae family and is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Its flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems. The woody follicles that form after flowering contain seeds that are dispersed by animals and wind."
