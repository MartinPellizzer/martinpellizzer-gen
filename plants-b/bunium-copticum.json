    "intro": "Bunium copticum, commonly known as Persian cumin or wild cumin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps that separate upon maturity. Bunium copticum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the umbelliferous group."
