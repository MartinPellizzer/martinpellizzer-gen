    "intro": "Blepharophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, small, and often pale or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Blepharophyllum species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. These plants thrive in humid, shaded environments and are popular among horticultural enthusiasts for their ornamental value."
