    "intro": "Becquerelia, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, slender stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for absorption of moisture and nutrients. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Becquerelia is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
