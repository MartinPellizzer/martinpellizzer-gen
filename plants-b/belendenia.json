    "intro": "Belendenia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae, native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plants typically grow as terrestrial herbs or small shrubs, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Belendenia species are known for their unique floral structures, which include specialized pollination mechanisms adapted to specific insect pollinators. These plants are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
