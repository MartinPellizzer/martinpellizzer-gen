    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. spiralis, commonly known as spiral brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
