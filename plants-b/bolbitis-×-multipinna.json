It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fronds that are typically golden-yellow to bronze in color, providing a striking visual contrast. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive pinna arrangement that gives it a feathery appearance. Bolbitis \u00d7 multipinna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate varying soil conditions."
