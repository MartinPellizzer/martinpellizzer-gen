    "intro": "Bartsia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered bartsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Bartsia densiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
