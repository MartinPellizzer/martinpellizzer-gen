    "intro": "Buinalis floridana, commonly known as the Florida buinalis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It is a small herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of freshwater bodies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Buinalis floridana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
