    "intro": "Betonica officinalis var. subulata, commonly known as the slender betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered with fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Betonica officinalis var. subulata is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
