    "intro": "Brachystele casillasii, commonly known as the Casillas' stilted fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its short, upright rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in high humidity and shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Brachystele casillasii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare fern."
