    "intro": "Bulbine parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant plant collections."
