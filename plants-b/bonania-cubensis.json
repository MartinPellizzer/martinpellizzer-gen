    "intro": "Bonania cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban bonania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal hammocks and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bonania cubensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
