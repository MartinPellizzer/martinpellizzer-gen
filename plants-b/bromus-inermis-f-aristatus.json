    "intro": "Bromus inermis f. aristatus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear a distinctive tuft of bristles at the tip. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
