    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. subtortilis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often form dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
