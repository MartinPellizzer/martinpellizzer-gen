    "intro": "Beccabunga anagallis-aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom from May to August. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by water. Beccabunga anagallis-aquatica plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
