    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile var. radicans, commonly known as the aquatic frog's foot, is a unique variant of the aquatic fern. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate in wetland environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating, depending on water conditions. Its reproductive structures are specialized for aquatic pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
