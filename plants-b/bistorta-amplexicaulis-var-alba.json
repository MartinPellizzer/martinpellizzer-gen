    "intro": "Bistorta amplexicaulis var. alba, commonly known as white bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright, rhizomatous growth habit and distinctive, basal leaves that are clasping around the stem. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
