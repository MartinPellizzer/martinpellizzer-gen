    "intro": "Bryonia ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals and later develops green, spiny fruits that mature to a red-orange color. Its leaves are heart-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Bryonia ciliata is also known for its medicinal properties, though its latex is toxic and requires careful handling."
