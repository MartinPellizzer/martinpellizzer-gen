    "intro": "Betula tricholepidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a species of birch native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it has a distinctive bark that is smooth and white in younger trees. Betula tricholepidea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
