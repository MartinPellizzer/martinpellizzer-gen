    "intro": "Bidens superba, commonly known as the pretty face or yellow oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 30 cm tall, featuring opposite, hairy leaves and yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk. The plant produces small, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Bidens superba is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
