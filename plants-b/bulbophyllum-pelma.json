    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pelma, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically borne on racemes and have a unique, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Bulbophyllum pelma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
