    "intro": "Bromus pectinatus, commonly known as the sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that mature into seeds. Bromus pectinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
