    "intro": "Betula alba var. populifolia, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are broadly ovate, with a serrated margin and a prominent midrib, resembling those of poplars. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed sites. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
