It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or spiky flower spikes, which are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
