    "intro": "Besleria reticulata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant nettle or large-leaved besleria, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its foliage. Its botanical name reflects its relationship to the genus Besleria and its distinctive reticulate leaf venation."
