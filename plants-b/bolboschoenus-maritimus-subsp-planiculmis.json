    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp. planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in tidal areas. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to stabilize shorelines and improve soil structure. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
