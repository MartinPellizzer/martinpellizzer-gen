    "intro": "Bauhinia subsessilis, commonly known as the small-leaved burr acacia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Bauhinia subsessilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
