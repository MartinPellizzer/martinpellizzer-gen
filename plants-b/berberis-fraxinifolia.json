    "intro": "Berberis fraxinifolia, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are ornamental but not edible for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and vibrant seasonal colors make it a valuable addition to horticultural landscapes."
