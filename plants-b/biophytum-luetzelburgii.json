    "intro": "Biophytum luetzelburgii, commonly known as the flame plant, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features vibrant, papery bracts that range in color from yellow to red, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which contrast with its showy foliage. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and easy to care for. The leaves are fleshy and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments."
