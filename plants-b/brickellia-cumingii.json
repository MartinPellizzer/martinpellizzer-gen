    "intro": "Brickellia cumingii, commonly known as the scarlet brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Brickellia cumingii is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
