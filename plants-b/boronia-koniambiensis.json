    "intro": "Boronia koniambiensis, commonly known as the Koniambe boronia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its small, fragrant flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
