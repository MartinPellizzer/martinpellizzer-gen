    "intro": "Borago longifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
