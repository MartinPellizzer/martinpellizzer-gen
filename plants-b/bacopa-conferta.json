    "intro": "Bacopa conferta, commonly known as the dwarf water bead, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize sediments. The plant features tiny, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which aids in water retention. Its flowers are small, blue or violet in color, and are borne on short stalks above the water surface. Bacopa conferta is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in ponds due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
