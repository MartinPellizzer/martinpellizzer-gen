    "intro": "Berberis steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
