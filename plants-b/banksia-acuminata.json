    "intro": "Banksia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cone-like structures that hold the seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in regeneration. Banksia acuminata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species."
