    "intro": "Begonia tawaensis, commonly known as the Tawae begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fuchsia-pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
