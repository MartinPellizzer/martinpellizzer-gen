It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but typically used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
