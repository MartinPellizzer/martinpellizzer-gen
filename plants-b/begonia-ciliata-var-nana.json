    "intro": "Begonia ciliata var. nana, commonly known as the compact begonia, is a compact, trailing plant with glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to tropical regions of South America, this variety thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. It is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. The plant is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and regular watering."
