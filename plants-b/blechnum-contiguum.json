    "intro": "Blechnum contiguum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that often resemble the shape of a stag's antlers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without deriving nutrients from its host. Its fronds are divided into a fertile and sterile portion, with the fertile fronds producing spores on the underside. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
