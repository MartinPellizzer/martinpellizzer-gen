    "intro": "Bulbophyllum coiloglossum, commonly known as the \"Crimson Lip\" orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lip-like petals that are often a deep red or orange color, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in clusters that can be quite showy. The plant requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
