    "intro": "Berrya ammonilla var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf berrya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn reddish in some varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
