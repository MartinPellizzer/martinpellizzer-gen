    "intro": "Beaufortia raggedensis, commonly known as the ragged rock-fig, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating, and the bark is typically rough and fissured. Beaufortia raggedensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
