    "intro": "Boscia reticulata, commonly known as the netleaf boschia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a net-like appearance. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Boscia reticulata is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional African medicine."
