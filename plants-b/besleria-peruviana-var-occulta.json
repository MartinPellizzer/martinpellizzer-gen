    "intro": "Besleria peruviana var. occulta, commonly known as the hidden peruvian bellflower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant features velvety, dark green foliage with a slightly waxy texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a rare and exotic houseplant."
