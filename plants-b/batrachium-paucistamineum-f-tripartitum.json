    "intro": "Batrachium paucistamineum f. tripartitum, commonly known as the tripartite spurred batrachium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spurred calyx and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
