    "intro": "Betula nana subsp. perfiljevii, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically glandular and hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
