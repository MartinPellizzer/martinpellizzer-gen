    "intro": "Bermudiana juncea var. normalis, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in lawns and pastures due to its drought tolerance and ability to recover quickly from wear. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
