    "intro": "Bromus vulgaris, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib. Bromus vulgaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
