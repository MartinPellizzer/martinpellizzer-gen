    "intro": "Begonia rabilii, commonly known as the Rabil's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
