    "intro": "Bromus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its hardy nature, Bromus nanus is considered a common weed in many regions."
