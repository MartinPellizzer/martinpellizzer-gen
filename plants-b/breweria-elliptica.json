    "intro": "Breweria elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic brewer's weed, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its fibrous roots make it well adapted to poor soils and drought conditions. Breweria elliptica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
