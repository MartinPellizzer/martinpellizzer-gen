    "intro": "Betula lenta var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release winged seeds. Its wood is strong and durable, historically used for furniture and cabinetry. The yellow birch is also valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its aesthetic appeal in forest landscapes."
