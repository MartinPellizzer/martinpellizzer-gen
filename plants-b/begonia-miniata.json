    "intro": "Begonia miniata, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features vibrant, velvety leaves that range in color from deep maroon to dark green, often with contrasting patterns. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
