It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
