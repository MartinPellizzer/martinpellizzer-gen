    "intro": "Bouteloua texana, commonly known as Texas dropseed, is a native grass species found primarily in the central and southern United States. It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple hues. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in arid regions. Bouteloua texana is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
