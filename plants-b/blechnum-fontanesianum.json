    "intro": "Blechnum fontanesianum, commonly known as the Fontanesian harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost tongue-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the rainforests of Central and West Africa. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in moist, well-drained soil. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
