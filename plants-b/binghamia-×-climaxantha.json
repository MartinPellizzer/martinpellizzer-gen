It is a hybrid between Binghamia capensis and Binghamia ribifolia, resulting in a plant with striking, flame-like red flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has a dense, spreading canopy with thick, waxy leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates."
