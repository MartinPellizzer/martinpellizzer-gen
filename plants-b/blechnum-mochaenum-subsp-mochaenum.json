    "intro": "Blechnum mochaenum subsp. mochaenum, commonly known as the Mocha fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a tight, compact structure."
