    "intro": "Bassovia wettsteiniana, commonly known as the Wettstein's bellflower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
