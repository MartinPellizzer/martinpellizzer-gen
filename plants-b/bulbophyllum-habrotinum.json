    "intro": "Bulbophyllum habrotinum, commonly known as the Habrotin's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
