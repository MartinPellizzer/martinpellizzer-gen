    "intro": "Blechnum decurrens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that often have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the undersides of the fronds."
