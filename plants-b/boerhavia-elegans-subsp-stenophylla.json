It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
