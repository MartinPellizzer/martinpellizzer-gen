    "intro": "Bolboschoenus robustus, commonly known as the swamp arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Bolboschoenus robustus thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
