    "intro": "Begonia micranthera subsp. albonervia, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
