    "intro": "Bryantiella palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's bryantiella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
