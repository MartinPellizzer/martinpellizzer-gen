    "intro": "Billardiera mutabilis, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its ability to grow on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces fragrant, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Billardiera mutabilis is also notable for its ability to change leaf color and shape in response to environmental conditions."
