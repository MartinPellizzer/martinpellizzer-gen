    "intro": "Beaufortia schaueri var. atrorubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed beaufortia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-brown stems, which are often covered in a layer of fine, white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Beaufortia schaueri var. atrorubens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight and drought."
