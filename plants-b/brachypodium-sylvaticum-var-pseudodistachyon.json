    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. pseudodistachyon, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, two-ranked spikelets contain both florets and sterile lemma-like structures, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
