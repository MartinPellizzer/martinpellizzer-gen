    "intro": "Brunsvigia rosea var. pudica, commonly known as the \"Pudica Lily\" or \"Cape Lily,\" is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems with clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen and contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
