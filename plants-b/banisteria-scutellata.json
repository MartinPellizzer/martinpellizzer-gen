    "intro": "Banisteria scutellata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Brazilian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
