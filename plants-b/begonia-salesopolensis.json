It is a herbaceous plant with heart-shaped, velvety leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and red. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-drained, rich soil. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
