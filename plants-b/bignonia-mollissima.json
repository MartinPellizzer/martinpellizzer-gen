    "intro": "Bignonia mollissima, commonly known as the velvet bindweed, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to twine around supports, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia mollissima is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
