    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cassideum, commonly known as the Cassideum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and wasps."
