    "intro": "Bouteloua micrantha, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, particularly in dry to mesic environments. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to form dense, tussock-like clumps. This plant is well adapted to prairie ecosystems and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Bouteloua micrantha plays an important role in soil stabilization and is a key component of native plant communities."
