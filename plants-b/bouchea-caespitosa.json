    "intro": "Bouchea caespitosa, commonly known as the blue blossom or bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Bouchea caespitosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
