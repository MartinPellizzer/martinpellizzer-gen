It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
