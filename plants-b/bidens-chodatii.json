    "intro": "Bidens chodatii, commonly known as Chodat's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and is often found in disturbed areas. Bidens chodatii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
