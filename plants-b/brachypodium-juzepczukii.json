    "intro": "Brachypodium juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's false brome, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is a small annual herb characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is native to Central Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
