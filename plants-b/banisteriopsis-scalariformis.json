    "intro": "Banisteriopsis scalariformis, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. The tree's most notable feature is its fruit, which is a hard, woody capsule containing several seeds, each encased in a toxic, resinous covering. The seeds, once the resin is removed, are the edible Brazil nuts sold globally. This species plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
