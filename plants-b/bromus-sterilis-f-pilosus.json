    "intro": "Bromus sterilis f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a variant of the false brome species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. This form is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance."
