    "intro": "Blakea subvaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Blakea subvaginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
