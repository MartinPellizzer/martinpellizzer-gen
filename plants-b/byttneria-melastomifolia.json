It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Byttneria melastomifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
