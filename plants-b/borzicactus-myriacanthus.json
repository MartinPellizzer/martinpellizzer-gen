    "intro": "Borzicactus myriacanthus, commonly known as the giant spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, segmented stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features dense clusters of sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the dry season. Borzicactus myriacanthus is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
