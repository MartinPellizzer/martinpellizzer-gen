    "intro": "Bromus rubens f. canescens, commonly known as the silver brome, is a variant of the common brome grass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This form is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale florets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
