    "intro": "Brachyelytrum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese false brome, is a grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into narrow, spikelet-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
