    "intro": "Betula papyracea var. communis, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it its common name. The tree has slender, upward-curving branches and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The paper birch plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
