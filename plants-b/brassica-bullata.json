    "intro": "Brassica bullata, commonly known as the inflated cabbage or bladder mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique, swollen, green pods that resemble inflated balloons, which are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a mild, peppery flavor, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. Brassica bullata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
