    "intro": "Barleria horrida, commonly known as the rough barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
