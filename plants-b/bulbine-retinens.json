    "intro": "Bulbine retinens, commonly known as the red bulbous plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is tuberous, which helps it survive in dry conditions by storing nutrients and moisture. Bulbine retinens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant appearance and drought tolerance."
