    "intro": "Banisteria sericea, commonly known as the silky banisteria, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a slender, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Banisteria sericea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
