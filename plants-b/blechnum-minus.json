    "intro": "Blechnum minus, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-like appearance on the underside. Blechnum minus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
