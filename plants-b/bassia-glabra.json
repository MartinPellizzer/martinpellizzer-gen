    "intro": "Bassia glabra, commonly known as smooth sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically smooth and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Bassia glabra is often found in disturbed areas and is used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
