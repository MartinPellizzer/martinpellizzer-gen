    "intro": "Belloa, commonly known as the \"flowering bell,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Belloa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They have a rosette growth habit with hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as Belloa grandiflora, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
