    "intro": "Bredia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves, which are usually glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Bredia reniformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
