    "intro": "Bromelia pinguin, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall, branched flower spike that can reach several feet in height, often displaying vibrant red or orange blooms. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Bromelia pinguin is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
