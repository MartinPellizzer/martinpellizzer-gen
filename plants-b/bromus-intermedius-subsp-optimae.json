It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to moderate grazing. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
