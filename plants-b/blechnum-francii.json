    "intro": "Blechnum francii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
