    "intro": "Baursea nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature. Baursea nervosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
