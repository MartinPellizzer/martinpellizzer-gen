It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a slightly undulating edge, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
