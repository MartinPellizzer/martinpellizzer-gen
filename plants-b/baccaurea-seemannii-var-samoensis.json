    "intro": "Baccaurea seemannii var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan mangosteen, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to the common mangosteen but are less widely cultivated. Its botanical features include thick, waxy leaves and a shrub-like growth habit, making it well adapted to humid, tropical climates. The species is of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
