    "intro": "Brittonamra caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is highly sought after in the timber industry. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
