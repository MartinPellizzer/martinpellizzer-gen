    "intro": "Bauhinia caterviflora, commonly known as the clustered bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of showy, papilionaceous flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Bauhinia caterviflora is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
