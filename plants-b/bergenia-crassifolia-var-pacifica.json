It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on sturdy, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the year, adding visual interest in both seasons."
