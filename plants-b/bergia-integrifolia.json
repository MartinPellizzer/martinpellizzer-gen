    "intro": "Bergia integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Bergia integrifolia is often found in dune environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
