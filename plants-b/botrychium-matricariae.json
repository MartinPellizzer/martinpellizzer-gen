    "intro": "Botrychium matricariae, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called soridia, are clustered in small, rounded masses known as sorus. Botrychium matricariae is a perennial plant that can be found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
