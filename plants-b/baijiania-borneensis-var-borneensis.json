    "intro": "Baijiania borneensis var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean baijiania, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
