    "intro": "Breynia asteranthos, commonly known as the starflower breynia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Breynia asteranthos is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
