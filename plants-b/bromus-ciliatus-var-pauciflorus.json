    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its low flower production, it is often considered a less showy member of the bromus genus."
