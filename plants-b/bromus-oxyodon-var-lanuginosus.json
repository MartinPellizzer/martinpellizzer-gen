    "intro": "Bromus oxyodon var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the hairy bulbous brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The variety lanuginosus is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
