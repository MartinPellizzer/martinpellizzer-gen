    "intro": "Barthlottia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar starflower, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are ovate and often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, which helps in water retention. The flowers, which are usually bright yellow or orange, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
