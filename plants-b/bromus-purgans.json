    "intro": "Bromus purgans, commonly known as the purple grass or purple bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-colored inflorescence, which sets it apart from other bromus species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including arid and semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Bromus purgans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
