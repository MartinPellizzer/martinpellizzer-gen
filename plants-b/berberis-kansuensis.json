    "intro": "Berberis kansuensis, commonly known as Chinese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China and parts of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The plant contains berberine, a compound with potential medicinal properties."
