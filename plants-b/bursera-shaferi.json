    "intro": "Bursera shaferi, commonly known as the Mexican birch, is a small evergreen shrub native to the dry forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that resembles the bark of birch trees, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bursera shaferi produces small, fragrant flowers and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme drought."
