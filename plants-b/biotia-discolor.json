    "intro": "Biotia discolor, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive coloration pattern. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. The plant's thallus is usually pale green or yellowish, with dark spots that give it its common name. It is characterized by its complex structure, consisting of a fungal component and algal symbionts. Biotia discolor plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a habitat for microorganisms."
