    "intro": "Bunium carvifolium, commonly known as wild fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust taproot and upright, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of fennel, and emit a mild anise-like aroma. Bunium carvifolium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
