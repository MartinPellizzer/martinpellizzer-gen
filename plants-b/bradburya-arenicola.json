    "intro": "Bradburya arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged opposite along the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bradburya arenicola is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, open habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
