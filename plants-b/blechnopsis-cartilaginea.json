    "intro": "Blechnopsis cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, cartilaginous fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique indusium. This species is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
