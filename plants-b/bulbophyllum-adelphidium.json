    "intro": "Bulbophyllum adelphidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
