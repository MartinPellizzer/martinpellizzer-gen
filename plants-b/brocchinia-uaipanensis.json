    "intro": "Brocchinia uaipanensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pitcher plant, is a species of carnivorous plant native to the Andes mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant's botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and carnivory."
