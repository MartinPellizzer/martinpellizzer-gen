    "intro": "Bletia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with three sepals and three petals, and are often clustered in a spike. Bletia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
