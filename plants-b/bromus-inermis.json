    "intro": "Bromus inermis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Smooth brome is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. It is valued for its use in forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
