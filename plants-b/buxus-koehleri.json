    "intro": "Buxus koehleri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus koehleri is valued for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for topiary and ornamental purposes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and shady borders."
