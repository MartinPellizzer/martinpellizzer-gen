    "intro": "Blechnum orientale var. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating holly fern, is a variant of the native fern species found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it a unique, wave-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of luciferin. This adaptation helps the plant attract nocturnal pollinators and deter herbivores."
