    "intro": "Bolbitis fluviatilis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams, rivers, and ponds. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients from the water. Bolbitis fluviatilis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
