It features a short, branching stem with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the winter months, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
