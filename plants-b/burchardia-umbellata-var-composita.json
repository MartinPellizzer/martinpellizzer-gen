    "intro": "Burchardia umbellata var. composita, commonly known as the composite bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale purple. The flowers are arranged in an umbel, giving the plant its scientific name, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
