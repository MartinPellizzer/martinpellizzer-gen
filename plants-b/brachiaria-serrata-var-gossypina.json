    "intro": "Brachiaria serrata var. gossypina, commonly known as hairy signalgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in pastures and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
