    "intro": "Bunium apiculatum, commonly known as the Alpine fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine."
