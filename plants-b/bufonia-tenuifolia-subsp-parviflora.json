    "intro": "Bufonia tenuifolia subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bufonia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing small, pale yellow blooms. The subspecies is characterized by its reduced flower size compared to the typical form of Bufonia tenuifolia."
