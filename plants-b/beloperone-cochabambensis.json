    "intro": "Beloperone cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba beloperone, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, typical of many shrubs in the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
