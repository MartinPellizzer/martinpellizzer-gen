    "intro": "Begonia obovatistipula, commonly known as the broad-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
