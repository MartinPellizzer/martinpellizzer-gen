It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant features a pseudobulb, which serves as a storage organ for water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and fragrant, usually appearing in clusters during the wet season. The leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in cultivation."
