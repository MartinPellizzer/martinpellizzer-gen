    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. grandis, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
