It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers. Bredemeyera drummondii typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant ecology."
