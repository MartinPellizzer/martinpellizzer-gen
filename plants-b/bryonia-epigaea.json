    "intro": "Bryonia epigaea, commonly known as poison ivy vine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid contact with the plant's sap, which can cause severe skin irritation."
