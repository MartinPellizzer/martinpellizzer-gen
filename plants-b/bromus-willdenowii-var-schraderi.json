    "intro": "Bromus willdenowii var. schraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three florets. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
