    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. gracile, commonly known as slender woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology research."
