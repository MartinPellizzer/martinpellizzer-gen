    "intro": "Bromus subulatus, commonly known as the needlegrass or slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. Bromus subulatus is also a common weed in agricultural fields and lawns."
