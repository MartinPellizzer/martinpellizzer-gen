    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. simplicissimum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It features a small, heart-shaped sporangium that is typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant is usually found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple and often have a unique, delicate structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
