    "intro": "Betula potaninii var. trichogemma, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white or pale bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is known for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
