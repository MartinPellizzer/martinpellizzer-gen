    "intro": "Begonia collina, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often hairy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Begonia collina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
