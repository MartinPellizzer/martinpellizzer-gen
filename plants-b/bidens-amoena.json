    "intro": "Bidens amoena, commonly known as the pretty beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers with white markings and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are dispersed by attaching to the fur of animals. Bidens amoena is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
