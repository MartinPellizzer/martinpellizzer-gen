    "intro": "Bertiera lejolyana, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Bertiera lejolyana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
