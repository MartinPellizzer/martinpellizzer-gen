    "intro": "Ballota adenophora, commonly known as the hairy ballota, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ballota adenophora is also known for its use in traditional herbal medicine."
