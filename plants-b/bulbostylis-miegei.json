It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact stature and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
