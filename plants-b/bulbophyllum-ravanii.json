    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ravanii, commonly known as the Ravanii orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia and the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical, often humid, and shaded habitat. The flowers are often clustered and can bloom multiple times a year under optimal conditions."
