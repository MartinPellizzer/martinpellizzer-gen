    "intro": "Betula evenkiensis, commonly known as the Evenki birch, is a species of birch native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, cool climates, often found in mountainous regions. The tree has slender, white-barked trunks and elongated, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The Evenki birch is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
