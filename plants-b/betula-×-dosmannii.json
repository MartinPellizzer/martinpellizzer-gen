It is a cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula platyphylla (Manchurian birch), resulting in a plant with unique characteristics. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it produces small, winged seeds in catkins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Betula \u00d7 dosmannii is also valued for its ability to withstand urban conditions and its role in ecological restoration projects."
