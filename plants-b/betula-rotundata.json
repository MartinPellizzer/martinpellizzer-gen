    "intro": "Betula rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a rounded tip, and are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
