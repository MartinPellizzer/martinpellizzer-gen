    "intro": "Bracteocarpus cinctus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its botanical features include a distinct, woody stem and a cycad-like appearance, making it a distinctive member of the Cycadaceae family. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
