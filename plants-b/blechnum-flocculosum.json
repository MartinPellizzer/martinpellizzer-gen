    "intro": "Blechnum flocculosum, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Blechnaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its soft, feathery fronds that appear fluffy due to the presence of dense, silky trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like growth, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Blechnum flocculosum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
