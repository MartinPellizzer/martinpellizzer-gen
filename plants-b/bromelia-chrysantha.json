    "intro": "Bromelia chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Bromelia chrysantha is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and moderate humidity."
