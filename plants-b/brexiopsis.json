    "intro": "Brexiopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, white, ghost-like blooms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Brexiopsis has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their pale appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
