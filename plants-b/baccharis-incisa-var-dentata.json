    "intro": "Baccharis incisa var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and is often found along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability to moist environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
