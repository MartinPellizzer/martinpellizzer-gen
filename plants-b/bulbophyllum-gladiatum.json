    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gladiatum, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth."
