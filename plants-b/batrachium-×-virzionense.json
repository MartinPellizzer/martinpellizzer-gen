    "intro": "Batrachium \u00d7 virzionense, commonly known as the hybrid swamp mallow, is a rare plant species native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a sprawling growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. Its botanical classification as a hybrid suggests it results from the cross between Batrachium corymbosum and Batrachium virgatum. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
