It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, bristly seed capsules. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. It is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
