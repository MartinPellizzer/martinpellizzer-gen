    "intro": "Betula cuspidata, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. This hardy species thrives in cold climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems."
