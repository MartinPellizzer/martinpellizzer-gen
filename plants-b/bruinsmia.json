It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white flowers. The plant's unique appearance, with its ghostly blooms and translucent leaves, has led to its mystical reputation among botanists and folklore enthusiasts. Bruinsmia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous terrain.
