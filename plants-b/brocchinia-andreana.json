    "intro": "Brocchinia andreana, commonly known as the Andean pitcher plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to collect and store rainwater in its native humid environment. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves, adding to its ornamental value. Brocchinia andreana is also notable for its ability to trap and digest small insects, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling."
