    "intro": "Bromus mairei, commonly known as the Maire's brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. Bromus mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
