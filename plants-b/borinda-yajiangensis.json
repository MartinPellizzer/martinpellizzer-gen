    "intro": "Borinda yajiangensis, commonly known as the Yajiang borinda, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yajiang region of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
