It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves with prominent parallel veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and flowering habits, it is a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation and botanical collections."
