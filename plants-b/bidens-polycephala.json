    "intro": "Bidens polycephala, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant features small yellow flowers with two white petals, and its seeds are covered in tiny hooks that aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It has hairy stems and leaves that are usually heart-shaped. Bidens polycephala is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
