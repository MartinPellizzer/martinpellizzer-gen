    "intro": "Begonia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant floral display."
