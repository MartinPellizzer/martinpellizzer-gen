    "intro": "Boopis australis, commonly known as the Australian boopis, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Boopis australis is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its resilience in harsh conditions."
