    "intro": "Brassaiopsis tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan bracken, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or on rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. Brassaiopsis tibetana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
