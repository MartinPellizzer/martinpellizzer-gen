    "intro": "Beta maritima subsp. atriplicifolia, commonly known as sea beet, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to withstand salty air and sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in harsh maritime environments. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a slightly salty and peppery flavor."
