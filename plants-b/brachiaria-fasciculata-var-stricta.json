    "intro": "Brachiaria fasciculata var. stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf signalgrass, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas and along waterways. This variety is notable for its potential use in pasture systems due to its palatability and adaptability to various soil types."
