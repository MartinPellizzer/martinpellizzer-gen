    "intro": "Beddomea, commonly known as the beddomea flower or beddomea plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with rough, scaly bark and small, elliptical leaves. Beddomea species are often found in coastal or sandy soils, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they require well-drained soil and full sun."
