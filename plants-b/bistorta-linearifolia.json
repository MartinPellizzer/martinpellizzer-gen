    "intro": "Bistorta linearifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Bistorta linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties."
