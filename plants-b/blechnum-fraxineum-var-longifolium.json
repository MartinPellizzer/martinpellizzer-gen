    "intro": "Blechnum fraxineum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance with finely divided pinnae. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
