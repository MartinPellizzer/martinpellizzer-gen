    "intro": "Bulbophyllum osyricera, commonly known as the Osyricera orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid tropical environments. It is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
