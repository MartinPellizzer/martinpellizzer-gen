    "intro": "Bupleurum marginatum var. minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
