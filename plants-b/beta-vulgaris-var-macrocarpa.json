    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the sugar beet. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that store high concentrations of sucrose. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating called epicuticular wax. Its growth habit is adapted to temperate climates, with a preference for well-drained soil and full sun. The variety is primarily cultivated for its root, which is used in the production of sugar and other industrial products."
