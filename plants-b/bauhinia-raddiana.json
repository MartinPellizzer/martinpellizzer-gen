    "intro": "Bauhinia raddiana, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like clusters of bright orange to red flowers that appear during the monsoon season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia raddiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
