    "intro": "Berberis subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prickly stems covered in a rough, scaly bark that provides a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Berberis subcoriacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
