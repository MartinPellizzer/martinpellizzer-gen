    "intro": "Bromus caucasicus, commonly known as Caucasian brome, is a grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets along their length. The plant typically produces small, two-rowed spikelets with lemmas that are often pubescent. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
