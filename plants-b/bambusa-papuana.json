    "intro": "Bambusa papuana, commonly known as the Papua bamboo, is a tall, clumping bamboo species native to New Guinea. It features slender, green culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a smooth, often glaucous surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and arranged in a V-shaped pattern along the culms. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Bambusa papuana is well adapted to moist, tropical environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal."
