It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and ecological plant in regions with Mediterranean climates."
