    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. microstachys, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense tufts with a clumped growth habit. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often hairless or sparsely hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
