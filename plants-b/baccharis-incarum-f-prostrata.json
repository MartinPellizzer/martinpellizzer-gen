    "intro": "Baccharis incarum f. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its prostrate growth habit makes it well adapted to spreading along the ground, forming dense mats."
