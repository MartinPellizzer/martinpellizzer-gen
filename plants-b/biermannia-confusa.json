    "intro": "Biermannia confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Biermannia confusa is considered critically endangered and is often difficult to study in the wild."
