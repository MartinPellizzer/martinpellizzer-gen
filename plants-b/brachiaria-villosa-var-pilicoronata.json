It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower spikelet being shorter and more slender. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and pastures. Its adaptability makes it a valuable forage species for livestock in tropical and subtropical regions."
