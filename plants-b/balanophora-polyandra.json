    "intro": "Balanophora polyandra, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Its morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and a cluster of leaves that are modified into tendrils for anchoring. Despite its ornamental appearance, it is considered a rare and specialized species found in specific tropical habitats."
