    "intro": "Billbergia richteriana var. bicolor, commonly known as the Rainbow Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, creating a striking visual display. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
