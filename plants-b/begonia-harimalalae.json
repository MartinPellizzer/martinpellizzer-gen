    "intro": "Begonia harimalalae, commonly known as the Madagascar begonia, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a range of colors, including deep red, purple, and green. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
