    "intro": "Berberis nummularia var. sinica, commonly known as Chinese dwarf barberry, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and emit a slight fragrance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its dense, low-growing habit. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
