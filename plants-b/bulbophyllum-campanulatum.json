    "intro": "Bulbophyllum campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
