    "intro": "Bromus pratensis, commonly known as meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, consisting of multiple spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus pratensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
