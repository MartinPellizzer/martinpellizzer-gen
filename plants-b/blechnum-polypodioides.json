    "intro": "Blechnum polypodioides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments resembling a fern's traditional structure. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in spreading and forming dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a metallic sheen, contributing to its common name. Blechnum polypodioides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
