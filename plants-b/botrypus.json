    "intro": "Botrypus, commonly known as water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semiaquatic ferns belonging to the family Water fern family (Onocleaceae). These plants are characterized by their floating fronds that form dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. Botrypus species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor them to submerged substrates. Their fronds are often divided into small, finger-like segments, contributing to their delicate appearance. These plants play an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
