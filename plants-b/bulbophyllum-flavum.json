    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flavum, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which contribute to its common name. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
