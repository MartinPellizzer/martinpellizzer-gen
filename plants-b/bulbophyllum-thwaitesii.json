    "intro": "Bulbophyllum thwaitesii, commonly known as the Wandering Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can extend up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces numerous small, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom sequentially along the spike. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in shaded, humid environments. The genus Bulbophyllum is known for its diverse morphology and is one of the largest genera of orchids, with over 2,000 species."
