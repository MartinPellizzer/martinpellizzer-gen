    "intro": "Begonia sinuata var. penangensis, commonly known as the Penang begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Malay Peninsula. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with wavy margins, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
