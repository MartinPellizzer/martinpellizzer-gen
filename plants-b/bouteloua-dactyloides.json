    "intro": "Bouteloua dactyloides, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has fine, hairy leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock. However, it can also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
