    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. gregsonii, commonly known as the Cape holly fern, is a variant of the Blechnum capense species native to South Africa. It is a fern characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to the humid, temperate climates of its native habitat."
