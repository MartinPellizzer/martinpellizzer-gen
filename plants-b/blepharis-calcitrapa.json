    "intro": "Blepharis calcitrapa, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, black seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its name reflects both its habitat and its flowering behavior, which occurs primarily at night."
