    "intro": "Brickellia mcdonaldii, commonly known as McDonald's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss."
