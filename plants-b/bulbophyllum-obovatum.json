    "intro": "Bulbophyllum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to withstand periods of drought. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting mix for optimal growth."
