    "intro": "Bulbostylis mozambica, commonly known as the Mozambique bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for small invertebrates."
