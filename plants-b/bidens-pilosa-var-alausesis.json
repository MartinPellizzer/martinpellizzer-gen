    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. alausesis, commonly known as the hairy beggarweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and invasive potential in some areas."
