It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, pendulous branches. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have doubly serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
