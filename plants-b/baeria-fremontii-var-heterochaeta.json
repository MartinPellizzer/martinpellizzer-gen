    "intro": "Baeria fremontii var. heterochaeta, commonly known as the fremont's baeria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
