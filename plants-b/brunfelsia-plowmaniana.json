    "intro": "Brunfelsia plowmaniana, commonly known as the purple shower tree, is a tropical shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that open in the evening and emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically oval and glossy, with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, red, fleshy seeds."
