It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its inflated, pod-like fruits that resemble bladders, which is where its common name originates. Its leaves are alternate and lobed, often with a hairy texture. Buchnera physalodes typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
