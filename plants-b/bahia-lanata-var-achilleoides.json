It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in summer, which are clustered in panicles. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. Its low maintenance requirements and ability to withstand heavy foot traffic contribute to its widespread use in landscaping."
