It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in compact clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits called cypsela. Blumea thorelii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
