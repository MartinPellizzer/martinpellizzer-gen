    "intro": "Betula lipskyi, commonly known as the Liptsin birch, is a rare and lesser-known species of birch native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The tree produces small, clustered catkins and has a distinctive bark that is smooth and pale in color. Betula lipskyi is adapted to mountainous environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
