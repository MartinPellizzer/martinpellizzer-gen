    "intro": "Bactris hirta, commonly known as the hairy palm or the red palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that are typically orange or red in color. Bactris hirta is often found in tropical rainforests and is adapted to thrive in humid, warm climates. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in horticulture and local food systems."
