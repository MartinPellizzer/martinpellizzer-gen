    "intro": "Briza, commonly known as quaking grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching inflorescences that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plants typically grow in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based flowers. Briza species are often used in ornamental gardening for their graceful appearance and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
