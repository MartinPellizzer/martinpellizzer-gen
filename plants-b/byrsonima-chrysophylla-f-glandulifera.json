    "intro": "Byrsonima chrysophylla f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leaved chrysophylla, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its glandular-stipitate leaves, which are often covered in small, sticky structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like, containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
