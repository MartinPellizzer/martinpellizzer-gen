    "intro": "Boscia foetida subsp. foetida, commonly known as the stink bush or sour bush, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy, red berries that are edible but have a strong, sour taste. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The species is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
