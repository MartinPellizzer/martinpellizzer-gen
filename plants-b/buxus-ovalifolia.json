    "intro": "Buxus ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red-brown berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for formal garden designs."
