    "intro": "Betula reticulata, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that develops intricate patterns as it ages. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically oval with serrated edges. Betula reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique bark and seasonal foliage."
