    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 intermedia f. media, commonly known as the silver birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both Betula pendula and Betula pubescens. It is known for its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver underside, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in temperate regions. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions contribute to its popularity in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
