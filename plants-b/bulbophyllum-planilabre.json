    "intro": "Bulbophyllum planilabre, commonly known as the flat-labellum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flat, and often brightly colored labellum, which is a specialized structure used in pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinct, spurred shape. Bulbophyllum planilabre is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance."
