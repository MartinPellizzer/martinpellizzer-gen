    "intro": "Bulbophyllum blaoense var. flavescens, commonly known as the Yellow-flowered Bulbophyllum, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow flowers with greenish-brown markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and sword-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
