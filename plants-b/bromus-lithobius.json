    "intro": "Bromus lithobius, commonly known as the stone bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Bromus lithobius is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid regions."
