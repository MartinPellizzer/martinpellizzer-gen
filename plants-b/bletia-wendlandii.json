    "intro": "Bletia wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland\u2019s bletia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It features slender, upright stems and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant is characterized by its linear, evergreen leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
