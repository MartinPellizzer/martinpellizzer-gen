    "intro": "Baccharis punculata, commonly known as rough baccharis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. Its adaptability makes it a common species in ecological restoration projects."
