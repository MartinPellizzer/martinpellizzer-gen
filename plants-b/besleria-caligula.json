    "intro": "Besleria caligula, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, arching leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
