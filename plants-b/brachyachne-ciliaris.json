    "intro": "Brachyachne ciliaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small wildlife. Brachyachne ciliaris is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
