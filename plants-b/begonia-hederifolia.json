    "intro": "Begonia hederifolia, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in the spring and summer. Its foliage is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its dense, spreading nature. Begonia hederifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces."
