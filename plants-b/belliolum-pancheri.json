    "intro": "Belliolum pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that typically range in color from blue to violet. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Belliolum pancheri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
