    "intro": "Bidens pectinata, commonly known as the bristly beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Bidens pectinata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
