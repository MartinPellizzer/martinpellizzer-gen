    "intro": "Briza media subvar. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
