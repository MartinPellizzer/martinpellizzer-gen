    "intro": "Barkhausia interrupta, commonly known as the red-flowered rock heath, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Barkhausia interrupta is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
