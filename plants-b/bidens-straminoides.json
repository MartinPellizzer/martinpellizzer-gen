    "intro": "Bidens straminoides, commonly known as yellow beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two ray florets and 12 to 20 disk florets, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its seeds are covered in bristly hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks."
