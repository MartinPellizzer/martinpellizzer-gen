    "intro": "Bletia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bletia humilis is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
