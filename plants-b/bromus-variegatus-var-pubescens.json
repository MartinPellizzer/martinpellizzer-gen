    "intro": "Bromus variegatus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the dense pubescence on its leaves. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny conditions. Bromus variegatus var. pubescens is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
