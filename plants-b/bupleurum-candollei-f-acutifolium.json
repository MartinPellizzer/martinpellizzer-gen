    "intro": "Bupleurum candollei f. acutifolium, commonly known as the acute-leaved Bupleurum, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Bupleurum genus. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. This plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. It produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting and ecologically sensitive species."
