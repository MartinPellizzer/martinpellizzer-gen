    "intro": "Balanophora formosana, commonly known as the Formosan ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species that relies on other plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on the trunks of trees in montane forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
