    "intro": "Brassica rubra, commonly known as wild mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Brassica rubra is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
