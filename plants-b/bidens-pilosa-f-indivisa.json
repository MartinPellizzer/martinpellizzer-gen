    "intro": "Bidens pilosa f. indivisa, commonly known as the roughleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flower heads composed of small, rayless florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
