    "intro": "Brassavola lineata, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a deep purple or red lip, and they bloom during the spring and summer months. Brassavola lineata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
