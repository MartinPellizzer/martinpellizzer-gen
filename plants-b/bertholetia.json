It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces large, woody fruits known as \"barras.\" The tree's most notable feature is its capsule-like fruit, which contains multiple seeds surrounded by a hard, oily shell. The Brazil nut tree plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its seeds are commercially valuable and are harvested for their nutritious, oily kernels."
