    "intro": "Boswellia chariensis, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and ancient tree native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, flaky bark that exudes a resin when damaged. The plant belongs to the Burseraceae family and is adapted to the arid and rugged environment of its native habitat. Its cones are small and clustered, and it produces winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
