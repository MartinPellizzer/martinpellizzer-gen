    "intro": "Bromus pskemensis, commonly known as the Pskem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three flowering florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Bromus pskemensis is adapted to cold climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
