    "intro": "Beauverdia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Beauverdia uniflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
