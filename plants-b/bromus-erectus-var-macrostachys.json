    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the tall brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and can thrive in a range of soil types. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
