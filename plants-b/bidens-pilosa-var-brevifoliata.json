    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. brevifoliata, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, followed by linear, bract-like fruits that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and an important species in ecological studies."
