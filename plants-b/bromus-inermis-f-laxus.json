    "intro": "Bromus inermis f. laxus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loosely branched spike, which produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
