    "intro": "Begonia ubahribuensis, commonly known as the Ubaribiu begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
