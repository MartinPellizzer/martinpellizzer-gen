It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
