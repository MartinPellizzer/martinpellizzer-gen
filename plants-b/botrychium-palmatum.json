    "intro": "Botrychium palmatum, commonly known as the palmate moonwort, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are divided into finger-like segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. Botrychium palmatum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
