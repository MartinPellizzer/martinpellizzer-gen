    "intro": "Bridelia moonii, commonly known as the moon's bridge tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant produces orange-red berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Bridelia moonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
