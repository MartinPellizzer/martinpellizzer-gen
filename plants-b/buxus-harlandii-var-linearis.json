    "intro": "Buxus harlandii var. linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are typically linear in shape, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other boxwood species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for use in formal gardens and as a topiary plant. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is prized for its dense, foliage."
