    "intro": "Bauhinia strychnifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the rainy season. Its fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release its seeds. The hairy bauhinia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
