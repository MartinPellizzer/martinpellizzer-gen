    "intro": "Buchanania, commonly known as the African star apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their smooth, often thorny stems and alternate, palmate leaves. Buchanania species produce small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red when mature, and is edible when ripe."
