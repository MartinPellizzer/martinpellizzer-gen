    "intro": "Begonia dolichotricha, commonly known as the long-hair begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that often have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
