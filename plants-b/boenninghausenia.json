    "intro": "Boenninghausenia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of a single species, Boenninghausenia monilifera, which is native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
