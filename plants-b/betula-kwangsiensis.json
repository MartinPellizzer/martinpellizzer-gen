It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, white bark and small, triangular leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
