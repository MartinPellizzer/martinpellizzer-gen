    "intro": "Blechnum penna-marina var. polypodioides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a feather, with a silvery underside due to the presence of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens."
