    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris f. lutea, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a compact shrub characterized by its bright yellow foliage. It features small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. Its berries, which are orange-red in color, appear in late summer and are edible but not particularly flavorful. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
