    "intro": "Bulbophyllum infundibuliforme, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique infundibular (funnel-shaped) floral structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The orchid's pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water and nutrients in its natural habitat."
