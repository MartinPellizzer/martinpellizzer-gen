    "intro": "Bolbitis rhizophylla, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a glossy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
