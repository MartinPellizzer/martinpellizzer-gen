    "intro": "Bromus sterilis, commonly known as the sterile brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its lack of viable seeds, as the flowers are sterile, which limits its ability to reproduce sexually. This trait makes it an important component in ecological studies related to plant reproduction and population dynamics."
