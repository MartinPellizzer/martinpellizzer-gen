    "intro": "Bandeiraea tenuiflora var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petalled sandalwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard, dark seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
