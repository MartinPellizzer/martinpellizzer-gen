It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
