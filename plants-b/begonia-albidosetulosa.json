    "intro": "Begonia albidosetulosa, commonly known as the white-hair begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are adorned with fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
