    "intro": "Bignonia radicans var. praecox, commonly known as the early flowering trumpet vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically dark green and hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both ornamental and useful for erosion control."
