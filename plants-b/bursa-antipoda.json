    "intro": "Bursa antipoda, commonly known as the antipodean burrs, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes species known for their distinctive seed structures. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that resemble burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by clinging to animal fur. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Bursa antipoda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
