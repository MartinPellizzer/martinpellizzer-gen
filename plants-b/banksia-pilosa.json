    "intro": "Banksia pilosa, commonly known as the silky banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy yellow flower heads that resemble small pine cones, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in dry sclerophyll forests. Banksia pilosa plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species."
