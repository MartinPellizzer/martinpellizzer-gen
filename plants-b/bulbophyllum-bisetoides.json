    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bisetoides, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It possesses elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. The plant produces striking, pale green to yellow flowers with intricate markings, often resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
