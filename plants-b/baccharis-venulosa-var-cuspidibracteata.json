    "intro": "Baccharis venulosa var. cuspidibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its bark is often fissured and may exude a resinous scent. It is valued in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
