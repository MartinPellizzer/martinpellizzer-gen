    "intro": "Betula nigra var. parvifolia, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of reddish-brown color. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its root system is well adapted to moist soils, making it suitable for riparian zones and wetland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
