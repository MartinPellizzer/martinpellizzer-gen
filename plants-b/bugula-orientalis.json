    "intro": "Bugula orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bugula, is a species of marine polychaete worm belonging to the phylum Annelida. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces such as rocks and artificial structures. The worm's body is segmented and covered in a protective layer of mucus, which helps it withstand environmental stressors. Bugula orientalis plays a role in marine ecosystems by serving as a food source for various invertebrates and fish. Its presence is often used as an indicator of water quality in coastal regions."
