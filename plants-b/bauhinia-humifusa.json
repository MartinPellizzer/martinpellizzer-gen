    "intro": "Bauhinia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces showy, raceme-like inflorescences of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize soil in disturbed areas. Bauhinia humifusa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
