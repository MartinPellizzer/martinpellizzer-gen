    "intro": "Boscia foetida, commonly known as the stink bush, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. Boscia foetida is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water storage. Its common name reflects the strong, unpleasant odor of its flowers, which can be overwhelming to humans."
