It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
