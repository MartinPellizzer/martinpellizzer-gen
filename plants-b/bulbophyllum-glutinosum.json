    "intro": "Bulbophyllum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant features elongated, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in water retention. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and pink. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
