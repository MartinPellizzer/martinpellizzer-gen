    "intro": "Bulbophyllum baladeanum, commonly known as the Baladean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is typically epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. The flowers often bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
