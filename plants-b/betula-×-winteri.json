    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 winteri, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Betula pendula and Betula jacquemontii. It is notable for its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, greenish leaves that turn golden in autumn. Betula \u00d7 winteri thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
