It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
