    "intro": "Bennettiodendron leprosipes var. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic bennettiodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by small, woody fruits. This variant is distinguished by its leaf morphology and is often found in association with other tropical flora in its native habitat."
