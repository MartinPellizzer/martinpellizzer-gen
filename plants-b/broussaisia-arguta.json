    "intro": "Broussaisia arguta, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Broussaisia arguta is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
