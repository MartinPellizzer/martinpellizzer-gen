    "intro": "Brachypodium ramosum subvar. bofillianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
