    "intro": "Besleria neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina mistflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often forming dense clumps with broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
