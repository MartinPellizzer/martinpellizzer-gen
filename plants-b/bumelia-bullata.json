    "intro": "Bumelia bullata, commonly known as the white buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Bumelia bullata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges and thickets."
