It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
