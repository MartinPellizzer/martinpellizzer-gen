    "intro": "Buxus crassifolia var. oblongata, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical boxwood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it suitable for various garden conditions."
