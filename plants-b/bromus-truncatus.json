    "intro": "Bromus truncatus, commonly known as the truncate brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Bromus truncatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
