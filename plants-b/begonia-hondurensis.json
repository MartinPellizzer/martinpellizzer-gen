    "intro": "Begonia hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central America. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep green color and distinctive reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
