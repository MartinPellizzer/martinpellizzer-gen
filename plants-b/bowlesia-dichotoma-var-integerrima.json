    "intro": "Bowlesia dichotoma var. integerrima, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in low-water environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
