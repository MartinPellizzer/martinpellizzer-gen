    "intro": "Betula ulmifolia, commonly known as the Spanish birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, branching form. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Betula ulmifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas."
