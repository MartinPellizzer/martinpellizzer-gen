    "intro": "Bunchosia biocellata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bunchosia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
