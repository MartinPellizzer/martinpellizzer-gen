    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the distinctive nodding appearance of its inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the seeds are small, wind-dispersed, and often found in clusters. Bromus erectus var. nutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
