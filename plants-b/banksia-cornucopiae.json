    "intro": "Banksia cornucopiae, commonly known as the Christmas Banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its large, cone-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind after the follicles open. Banksia cornucopiae thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique floral structure and ecological significance make it an important species in the local flora."
