    "intro": "Baccharis alaternoides, commonly known as Spanish Heath, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value. Baccharis alaternoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
