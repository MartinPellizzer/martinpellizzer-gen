    "intro": "Bauhinia foraminifera, commonly known as the laceleaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its fruit is a flat, leathery pod that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia foraminifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
