    "intro": "Bupleurum mucronatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a distinctive sharp tip, giving it its common name. Bupleurum mucronatum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates."
