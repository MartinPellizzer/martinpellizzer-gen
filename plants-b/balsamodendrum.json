    "intro": "Balsamodendrum, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in complex inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds. Balsamodendrum species are often found in moist, shaded habitats and are valued for their ornamental foliage and ecological importance in their native environments."
