    "intro": "Brachiaria fusiformis, commonly known as flatleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Brachiaria fusiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
