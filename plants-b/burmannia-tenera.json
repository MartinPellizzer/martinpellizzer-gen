    "intro": "Burmannia tenera, commonly known as the sticky false arum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a showy, often red or orange bract. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a sticky substance, which aids in seed dispersal. Burmannia tenera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
