    "intro": "Bidens elliptica var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
