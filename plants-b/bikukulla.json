It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage with broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bikukulla is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
