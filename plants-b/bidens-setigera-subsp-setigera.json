It is a herbaceous annual with opposite, hairy, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
