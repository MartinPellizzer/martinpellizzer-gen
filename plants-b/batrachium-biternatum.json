    "intro": "Batrachium biternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, lobed thallus that often forms a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring and absorbing nutrients. Batrachium biternatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
