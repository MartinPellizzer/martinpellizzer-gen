    "intro": "Brachypodium miserum subsp. kurilense, commonly known as Kuril slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Kuril Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
