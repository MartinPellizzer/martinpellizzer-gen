    "intro": "Beyeria subtecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Beyeria subtecta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting succulent-like features to store water. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is considered a valuable plant in traditional medicine."
