It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. Bletia alta thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
