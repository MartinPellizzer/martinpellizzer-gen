    "intro": "Bromus simplex, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It is often used for forage and erosion control due to its rapid growth and dense root system. Bromus simplex is also known for its ability to thrive in temperate climates with moderate rainfall."
