    "intro": "Batrachium carinatum, commonly known as the spurred batrachium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spurred calyx that resembles a bat's foot, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Batrachium carinatum is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a unique component of tropical flora."
