    "intro": "Bidens bipinnata, commonly known as the two-leaf tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnately divided leaves, which give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three, with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Bidens bipinnata is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
