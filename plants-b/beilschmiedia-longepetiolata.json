    "intro": "Beilschmiedia longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
