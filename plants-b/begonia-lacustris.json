    "intro": "Begonia lacustris, commonly known as the lake begonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. Begonia lacustris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
