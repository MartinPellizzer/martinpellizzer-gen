    "intro": "Bassia intricata var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy filaree, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage and compact growth habit make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
