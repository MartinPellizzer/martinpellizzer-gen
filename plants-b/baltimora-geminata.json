    "intro": "Baltimora geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Baltimora geminata is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded undergrowth, thriving in humid, nutrient-rich environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
