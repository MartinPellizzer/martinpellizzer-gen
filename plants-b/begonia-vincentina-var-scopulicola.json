    "intro": "Begonia vincentina var. scopulicola, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and pink. The leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental needs, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
