    "intro": "Brassica campestris stirps oleifera, commonly known as rapeseed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, upright stem and large, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by pods containing round, oily seeds. Rapeseed is cultivated primarily for its seeds, which are used to extract oil for culinary and industrial purposes. It is also known for its ability to accumulate high levels of glucosinolates, which contribute to its distinctive flavor and potential health benefits."
