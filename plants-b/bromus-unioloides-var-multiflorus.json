    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. multiflorus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
