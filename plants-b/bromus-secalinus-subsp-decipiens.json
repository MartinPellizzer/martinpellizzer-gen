    "intro": "Bromus secalinus subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the seeds are enclosed in small, three-angled capsules. This subspecies is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to thrive in various environments."
