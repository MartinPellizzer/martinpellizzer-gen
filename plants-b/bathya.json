    "intro": "Bathya, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bathya is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
