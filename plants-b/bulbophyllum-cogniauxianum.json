    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cogniauxianum, commonly known as the Cogniaux's torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often red or orange-colored flowers that resemble torches, which are borne on tall, slender inflorescences. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical habitat. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
