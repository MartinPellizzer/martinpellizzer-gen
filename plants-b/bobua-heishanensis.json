    "intro": "Bobua heishanensis, commonly known as the black mountain bobua, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to habitat loss, Bobua heishanensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
