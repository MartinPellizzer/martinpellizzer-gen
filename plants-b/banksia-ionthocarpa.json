    "intro": "Banksia ionthocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are a key feature of the genus Banksia. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white or greyish hairs. Banksia ionthocarpa is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
