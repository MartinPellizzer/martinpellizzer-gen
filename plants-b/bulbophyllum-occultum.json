    "intro": "Bulbophyllum occultum, commonly known as the hidden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often concealed among its foliage, giving it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the wet season. Bulbophyllum occultum is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
