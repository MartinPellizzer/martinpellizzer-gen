    "intro": "Borreria tampicana, commonly known as desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Borreria tampicana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in its native range."
