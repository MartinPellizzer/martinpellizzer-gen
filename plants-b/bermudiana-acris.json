    "intro": "Bermudiana acris, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is drought-tolerant and often forms dense mats, making it a common invasive species in disturbed areas. Its ability to spread through rhizomes and tillers contributes to its resilience and widespread distribution. Bermudiana acris is widely used for lawns, pastures, and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
