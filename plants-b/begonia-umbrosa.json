    "intro": "Begonia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow begonia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that thrive in low-light conditions, making it an excellent choice for shaded indoor environments. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often blooming during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters of foliage. Begonia umbrosa prefers moist, well-draining soil and consistent humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
