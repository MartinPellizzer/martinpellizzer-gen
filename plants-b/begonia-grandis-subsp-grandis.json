    "intro": "Begonia grandis subsp. grandis, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
