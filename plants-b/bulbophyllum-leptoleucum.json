    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leptoleucum, commonly known as the pale-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clustered inflorescences that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and delicate flowers make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
