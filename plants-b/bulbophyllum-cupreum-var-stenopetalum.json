    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cupreum var. stenopetalum, commonly known as the copper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, copper-colored pseudobulbs that are often covered in a waxy sheath. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, yellowish-green to reddish flowers that have a distinctive, narrow petal shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
