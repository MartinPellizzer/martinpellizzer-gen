    "intro": "Banksia dallanneyi, commonly known as the Geraldton banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, a feature common among many members of the Proteaceae family. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. The Geraldton banksia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
