    "intro": "Bouteloua breviseta, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open prairies and dry landscapes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular native plant for ecological and ornamental gardens."
