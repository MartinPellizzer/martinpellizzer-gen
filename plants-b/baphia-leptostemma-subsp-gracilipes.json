    "intro": "Baphia leptostemma subsp. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed baphia, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
