    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate downy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically green or pale yellow when immature. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated."
