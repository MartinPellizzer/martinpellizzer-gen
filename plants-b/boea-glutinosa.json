    "intro": "Boea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky vine or sticky plant, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in adhesion to surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. Boea glutinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
