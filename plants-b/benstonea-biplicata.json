    "intro": "Benstonea biplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bifurcated fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often folded in a double manner. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Benstonea biplicata is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
