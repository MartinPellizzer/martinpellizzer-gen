    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 hornei, commonly known as the paper birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between white birch (Betula papyrifera) and black birch (Betula nigra). It is characterized by its distinctive white, peeling bark that resembles paper, which is a key botanical feature. The plant is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. It has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Betula \u00d7 hornei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
