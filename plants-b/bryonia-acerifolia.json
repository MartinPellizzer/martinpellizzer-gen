    "intro": "Bryonia acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved bryony, is a climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its stems are hairy and have tendrils that help it climb, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
