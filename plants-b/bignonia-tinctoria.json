    "intro": "Bignonia tinctoria, commonly known as the crossvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vigorous climber with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and along fences. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
