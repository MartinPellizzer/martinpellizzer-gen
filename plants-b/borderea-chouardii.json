Native to the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees in southern France, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features delicate, evergreen leaves with a waxy texture and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring. It is notable for its unique morphology and is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this botanical gem."
