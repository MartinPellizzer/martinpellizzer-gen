    "intro": "Bilderdykia ciliinodis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Bilderdykia ciliinodis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
