    "intro": "Begonia crenata, commonly known as the serrated begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, palmate leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
