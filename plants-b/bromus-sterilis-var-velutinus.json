    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
