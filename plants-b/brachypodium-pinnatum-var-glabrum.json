    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth little grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its varietal name \"glabrum.\" The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
