    "intro": "Berberis nervosa, commonly known as the thimbleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible and often consumed by birds and wildlife. Berberis nervosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
