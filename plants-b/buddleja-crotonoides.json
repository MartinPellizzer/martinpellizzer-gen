    "intro": "Buddleja crotonoides, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like inflorescences that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a serrated margin. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Buddleja crotonoides is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils."
