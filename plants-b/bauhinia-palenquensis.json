It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods, which contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and seed dispersal."
