    "intro": "Balanophora indica var. minor, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous and lack the typical showy features of many orchids. It is native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
