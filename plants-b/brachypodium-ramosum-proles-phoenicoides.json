It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
