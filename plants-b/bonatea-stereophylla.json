    "intro": "Bonatea stereophylla, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Bonatea stereophylla plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
