    "intro": "Bromus catharticus, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Bromus catharticus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
