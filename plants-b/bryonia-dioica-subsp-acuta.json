    "intro": "Bryonia dioica subsp. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-barked bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are followed by orange or red, spiny fruits. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered with a distinctive white, powdery coating called farina. The subspecies acuta is distinguished by its more sharply toothed leaves and shorter, more upright stems compared to other forms of Bryonia dioica."
