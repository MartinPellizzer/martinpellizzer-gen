    "intro": "Barkhausia decumbens, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, fleshy stems. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Barkhausia decumbens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
