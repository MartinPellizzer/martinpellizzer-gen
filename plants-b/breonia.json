    "intro": "Breonia, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Breonia grandiflora, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Breonia species are often found in the understory of forests, where they thrive in the cool, humid conditions."
