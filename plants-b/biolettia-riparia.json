    "intro": "Biolettia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Biolettia riparia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
