    "intro": "Betula verrucosa f. expansa, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its smooth, white bark that lacks the flaky texture of the typical species. It is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant features small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces catkins as its primary means of seed dispersal. Its growth habit is typically slow, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
