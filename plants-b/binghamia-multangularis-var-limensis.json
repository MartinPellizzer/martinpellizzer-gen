    "intro": "Binghamia multangularis var. limensis, commonly known as the Limens Island binghamia, is a rare and unique plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, and often spiny stems that form a compact shrub. The leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
