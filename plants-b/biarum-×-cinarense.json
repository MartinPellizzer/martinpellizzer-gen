It is a cross between Biarum pulchellum and Biarum segovicum, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy."
