    "intro": "Berberis cabrerae, commonly known as the Canary Island barberry, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
