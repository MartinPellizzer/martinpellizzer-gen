It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
