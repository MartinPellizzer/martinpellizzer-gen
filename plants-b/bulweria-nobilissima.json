    "intro": "Bulweria nobilissima, commonly known as the noble bulweria, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to crimson. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bulweria nobilissima is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
