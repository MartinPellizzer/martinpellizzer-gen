    "intro": "Brachychiton tuberculatus, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
