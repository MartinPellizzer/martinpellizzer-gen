    "intro": "Biscutella apula f. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate biscuitroot, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lobed and covered in a fine, reticulate pattern, giving it its specific epithet. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
