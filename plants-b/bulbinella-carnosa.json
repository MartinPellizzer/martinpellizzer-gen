    "intro": "Bulbinella carnosa, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Bulbinella carnosa is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
