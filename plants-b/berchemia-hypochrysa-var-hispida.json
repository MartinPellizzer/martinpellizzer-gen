    "intro": "Berchemia hypochrysa var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-stemmed berchemia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
