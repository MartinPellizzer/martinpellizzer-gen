    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaved boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with oval, rounded leaves that are slightly larger than those of the standard boxwood. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a slow growth rate, making it ideal for topiary and formal garden designs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, though it can tolerate shade. Due to its ornamental value and ease of maintenance, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
