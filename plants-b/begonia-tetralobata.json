    "intro": "Begonia tetralobata, commonly known as the four-lobed begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with four lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and prolonged blooming period."
