    "intro": "Brodiaea coronaria var. mundula, commonly known as the Sierra Valley brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a perennial herb that produces small, tuberous roots, which help it survive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
