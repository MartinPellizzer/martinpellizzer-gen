    "intro": "Betula bella, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring a compact, often multi-stemmed form. The plant has smooth, gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula bella thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments."
