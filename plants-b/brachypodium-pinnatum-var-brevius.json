It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, two-lipped flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
