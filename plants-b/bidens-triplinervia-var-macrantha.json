    "intro": "Bidens triplinervia var. macrantha, commonly known as the largeflower beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, bristled seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
