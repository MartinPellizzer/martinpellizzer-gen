    "intro": "Biscutella varia subsp. kerneri, commonly known as Kern\u2019s biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with mustard-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
