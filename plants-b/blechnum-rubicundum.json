    "intro": "Blechnum rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are often reddish or bronze in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often clustered at the base of the plant."
