    "intro": "Breweria alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf brewer's grass, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its alternate leaf arrangement and slender, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Breweria alternifolia is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
