    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa, commonly known as sticky weed or sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, and its stems often have a sticky coating. Bastardia viscosa is adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to survive in sandy soils. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
