    "intro": "Bowlesia tropaeolifolia var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
