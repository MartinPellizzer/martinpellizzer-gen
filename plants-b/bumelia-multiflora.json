    "intro": "Bumelia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Bumelia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
