    "intro": "Begonia egleri, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that range in color from deep green to rich burgundy. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
