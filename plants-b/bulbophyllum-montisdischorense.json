    "intro": "Bulbophyllum montisdischorense, commonly known as the mountain Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure, with flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish-white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss. This orchid is noted for its resilience and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
