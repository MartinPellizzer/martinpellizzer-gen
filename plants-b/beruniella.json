    "intro": "Beruniella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Beruniella is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
