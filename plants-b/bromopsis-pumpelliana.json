    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Bromopsis pumpelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
