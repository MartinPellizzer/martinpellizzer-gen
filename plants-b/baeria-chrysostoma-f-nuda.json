    "intro": "Baeria chrysostoma f. nuda, commonly known as the naked baeria, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with leaves that are often reduced or absent, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow to white coloration. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
