    "intro": "Berlinia paniculata var. ferruginea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with a distinctive reddish or rusty coloration on the underside. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
