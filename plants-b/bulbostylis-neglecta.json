    "intro": "Bulbostylis neglecta, commonly known as the small spike sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically inconspicuous, with tiny, three-parted flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain areas."
