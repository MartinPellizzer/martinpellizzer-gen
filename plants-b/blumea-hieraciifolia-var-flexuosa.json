    "intro": "Blumea hieraciifolia var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible blumea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This variant is distinguished by its flexible stem structure, which allows it to bend and sway in the wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
