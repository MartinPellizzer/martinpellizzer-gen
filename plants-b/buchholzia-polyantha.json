    "intro": "Buchholzia polyantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. Buchholzia polyantha is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and crafts."
