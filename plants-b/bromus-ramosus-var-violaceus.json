    "intro": "Bromus ramosus var. violaceus, commonly known as violet false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically violet to purple in color, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves are usually blue-gray in hue, with a rough texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is often found in meadows, open woodlands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
