    "intro": "Bursera orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern South America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The plant typically grows in dry to semi-deciduous tropical forests and is adapted to seasonal droughts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds."
