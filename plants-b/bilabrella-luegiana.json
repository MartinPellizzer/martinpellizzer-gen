It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.
