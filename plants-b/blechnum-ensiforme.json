It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, slender, and leathery fronds that resemble a sword. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates like soil or rock. Blechnum ensiforme is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
