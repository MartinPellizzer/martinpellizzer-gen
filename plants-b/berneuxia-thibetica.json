    "intro": "Berneuxia thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan berneuxia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
