    "intro": "Balanophora hongkongensis, commonly known as the Hong Kong ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of southern China. It is a holoparasitic orchid, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plants, typically other members of the Orchidaceae family. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in a spike, and are adapted for specific pollination by insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
