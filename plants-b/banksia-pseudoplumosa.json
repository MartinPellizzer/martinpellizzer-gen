    "intro": "Banksia pseudoplumosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that are typically orange to yellow in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Banksia pseudoplumosa is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native animals."
