    "intro": "Begonia croatii, commonly known as the Croatian begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Balkan region. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
