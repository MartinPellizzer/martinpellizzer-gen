    "intro": "Blechnum delicatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically light green with a silvery sheen. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Blechnum delicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
