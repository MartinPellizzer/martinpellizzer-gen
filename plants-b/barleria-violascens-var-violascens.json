    "intro": "Barleria violascens var. violascens, commonly known as purple barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple or violet, typically clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, often from spring to early autumn."
