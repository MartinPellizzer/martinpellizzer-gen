    "intro": "Begonia mollissima, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in woodland gardens."
