    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris f. minima, commonly known as the small-bract bulbostylis, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and tiny, clustered spikelets that are often difficult to distinguish from other similar species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheathing at the base. This variant is notable for its reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Bulbostylis capillaris."
