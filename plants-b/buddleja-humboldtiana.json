    "intro": "Buddleja humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's bush or the giant butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
