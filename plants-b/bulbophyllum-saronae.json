It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with intricate patterns and colors that range from white to yellow and green. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its often humid and shaded environment."
