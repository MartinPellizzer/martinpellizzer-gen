    "intro": "Bucida buceras var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, red fruits that split open to release seeds. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to maritime environments, and it is often used in coastal landscaping. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
