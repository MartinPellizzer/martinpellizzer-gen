    "intro": "Bromus secalinus subsp. commutatus, commonly known as the red brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually reddish in color. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
