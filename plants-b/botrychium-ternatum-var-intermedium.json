    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is clustered on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This variant is closely related to other species in the Botrychium genus, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
