    "intro": "Bebbia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy environment. Bebbia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and dunes. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
