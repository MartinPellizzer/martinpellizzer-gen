    "intro": "Bistorta suffulta, commonly known as the purple bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants commonly referred to as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and its basal leaves are broad and heart-shaped with a distinctive purple underside. Bistorta suffulta produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by dark purple, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
