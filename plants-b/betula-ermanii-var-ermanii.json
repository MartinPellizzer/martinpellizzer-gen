    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. ermanii, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
