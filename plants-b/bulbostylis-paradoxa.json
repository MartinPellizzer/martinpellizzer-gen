It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate spikelets and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. It has a short rhizomatous stem and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
