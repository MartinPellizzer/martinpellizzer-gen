    "intro": "Balanophora harlandii var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral balanophora, is a rare parasitic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Balanophoraceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This variant is distinguished by its spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it its specific name."
