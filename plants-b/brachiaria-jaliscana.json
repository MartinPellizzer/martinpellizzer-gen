    "intro": "Brachiaria jaliscana, commonly known as Mexican grass or Jalisco grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in various soil conditions. Brachiaria jaliscana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
