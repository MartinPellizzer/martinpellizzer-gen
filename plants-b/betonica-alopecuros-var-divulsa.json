    "intro": "Betonica alopecuros var. divulsa, commonly known as the creeping betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features a low-growing habit with spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Betonica alopecuros var. divulsa is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
