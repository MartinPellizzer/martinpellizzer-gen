It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its compact stature, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in wet, muddy habitats such as marshes and along waterways. Due to its size and habitat preferences, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
