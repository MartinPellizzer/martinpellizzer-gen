    "intro": "Bauhinia kalbreyeri, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and often shed seasonally, contributing to its ornamental value. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Bauhinia kalbreyeri is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
