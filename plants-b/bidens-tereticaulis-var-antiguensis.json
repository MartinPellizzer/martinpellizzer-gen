It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of ecological study in its native range."
