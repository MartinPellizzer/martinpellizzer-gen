It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its culms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Bromus tectorius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
