    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus f. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered soft brome, is a variant of the soft brome grass. It is a perennial grass species native to the western United States, particularly in regions with dry, rocky soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, bluish-green leaves and inflorescences that are less dense compared to the typical form. The subspecies is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
