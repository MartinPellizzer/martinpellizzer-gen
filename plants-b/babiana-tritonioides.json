It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It produces a bulbous base that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
