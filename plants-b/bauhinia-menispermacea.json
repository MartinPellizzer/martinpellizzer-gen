    "intro": "Bauhinia menispermacea, commonly known as the coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, papery, palmate leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling coral, hence its common name. Bauhinia menispermacea is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also contributes to its ecological significance."
