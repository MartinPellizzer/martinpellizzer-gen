    "intro": "Bupleurum longifolium f. exsertum, commonly known as the long-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
