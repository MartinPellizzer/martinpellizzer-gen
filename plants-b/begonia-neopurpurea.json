    "intro": "Begonia neopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of about 1 to 2 feet. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Begonia neopurpurea thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shady garden beds and indoor cultivation."
