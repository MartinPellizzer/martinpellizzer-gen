    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between white birch (Betula pendula) and black birch (Betula nigra). It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, similar to its parent species. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula \u00d7 intermedia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
