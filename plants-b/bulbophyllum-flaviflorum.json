    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flaviflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces a single, showy yellow flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
