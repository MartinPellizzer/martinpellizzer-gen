    "intro": "Berchemia polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved berchemia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
