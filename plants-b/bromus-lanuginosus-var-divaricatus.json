    "intro": "Bromus lanuginosus var. divaricatus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
