    "intro": "Bancalus zeylanicus, commonly known as the red palm weevil, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Dynastidae. It is native to South and Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. The adult beetle is characterized by its elongated body, typically ranging from 3 to 5 centimeters in length, and a striking red or orange coloration with black markings. The larvae of this species are known to feed on the tissues of palm trees, causing significant damage to palms such as the coconut and date palm. Due to its destructive feeding habits, Bancalus zeylanicus is considered a major agricultural pest in tropical regions."
