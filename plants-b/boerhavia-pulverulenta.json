    "intro": "Boerhavia pulverulenta, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Boerhavia pulverulenta is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture availability."
