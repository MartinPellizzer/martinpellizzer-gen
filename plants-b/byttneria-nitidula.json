    "intro": "Byttneria nitidula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Africa and parts of Asia, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
