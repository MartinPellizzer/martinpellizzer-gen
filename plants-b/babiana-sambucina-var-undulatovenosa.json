    "intro": "Babiana sambucina var. undulatovenosa, commonly known as the undulating-veined babiana, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue, and the plant forms dense clumps through rhizomes. Its unique undulating venation in the leaves makes it easily distinguishable from other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
