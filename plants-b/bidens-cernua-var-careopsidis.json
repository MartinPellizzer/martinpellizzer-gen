    "intro": "Bidens cernua var. careopsidis, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and roadside ditches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with prominent central disks. It produces small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
