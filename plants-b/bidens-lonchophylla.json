    "intro": "Bidens lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers with white markings, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Bidens lonchophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
