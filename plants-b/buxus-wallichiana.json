The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is highly valued in horticulture for its compact growth and ability to be shaped into intricate forms. Buxus wallichiana thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and topiaries."
