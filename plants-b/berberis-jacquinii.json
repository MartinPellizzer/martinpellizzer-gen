It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Berberis jacquinii is also valued for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids such as berberine."
