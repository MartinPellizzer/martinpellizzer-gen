It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
