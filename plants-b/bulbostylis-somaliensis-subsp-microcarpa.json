    "intro": "Bulbostylis somaliensis subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the Somali bulbostylis, is a small, perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Somalia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
