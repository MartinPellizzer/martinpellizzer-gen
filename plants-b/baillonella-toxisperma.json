    "intro": "Baillonella toxisperma, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, leathery texture, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its wood and leaves. Baillonella toxisperma is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
