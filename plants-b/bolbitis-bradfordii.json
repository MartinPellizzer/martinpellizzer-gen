    "intro": "Bolbitis bradfordii, commonly known as the Bradford's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis bradfordii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
