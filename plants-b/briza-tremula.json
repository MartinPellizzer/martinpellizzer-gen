    "intro": "Briza tremula, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that sway in the wind, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery-blue hue on the underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, forming in dense, fluffy clusters at the tips of the stems. Briza tremula is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
