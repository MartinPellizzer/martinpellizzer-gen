    "intro": "Bromus japonicus subsp. anatolicus, commonly known as the Anatolian brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Turkey and the Middle East. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is adapted to survive in arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and its potential for use in restoration projects."
