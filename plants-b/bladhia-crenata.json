    "intro": "Bladhia crenata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Bladhia crenata is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants like the sundew and the butterwort. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
