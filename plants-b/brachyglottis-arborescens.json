    "intro": "Brachyglottis arborescens, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub-like species that typically grows in coastal and alpine regions, characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads resembling dandelion fluff. It is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
