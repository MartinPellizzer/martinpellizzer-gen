    "intro": "Bromus diandrus f. propendens, commonly known as the prostrate brome, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or\u530d\u5310 growth habit, with slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awnless spikelets. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in agricultural and ecological settings."
