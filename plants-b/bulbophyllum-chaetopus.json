    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chaetopus, commonly known as the hairy-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide structural support."
