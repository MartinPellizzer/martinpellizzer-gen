    "intro": "Bakerisideroxylon passargei, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare tree endemic to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, flaky bark. The plant has spiral-arranged leaves that are scale-like and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
