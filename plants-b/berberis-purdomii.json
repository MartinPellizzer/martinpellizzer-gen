    "intro": "Berberis purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
