    "intro": "Borassus heineanus, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to tropical Africa. It features a straight trunk that can grow up to 15 meters in height, crowned with a large, fan-shaped leaf that can span several meters in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in panicles, which eventually develop into fibrous fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are used for thatching and roofing, while the trunk provides material for construction and handicrafts. The plant thrives in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to seasonal flooding."
