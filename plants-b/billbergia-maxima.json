    "intro": "Billbergia maxima, commonly known as the giant billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water collection and retention. Billbergia maxima thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
