It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple florets arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Briza anceps is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
