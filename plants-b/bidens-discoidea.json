    "intro": "Bidens discoidea, commonly known as the golden crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Bidens discoidea is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
