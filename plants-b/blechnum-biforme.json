It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of leaves. The fronds are evergreen and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value."
