    "intro": "Bassia sericea, commonly known as silverleaf flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Bassia sericea is a drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
