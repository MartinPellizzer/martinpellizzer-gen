    "intro": "Borya sublanosa, commonly known as the woolly borya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink, and bloom in early summer. Borya sublanosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
