    "intro": "Betula dolicholepis, commonly known as the longleaf birch, is a species of birch native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are elliptical, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, typically appearing in clusters of three. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
