    "intro": "Bulbophyllum insigne, commonly known as the noble orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid tropical environments. The flowers bloom in clusters and can vary in color from white to pink, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
