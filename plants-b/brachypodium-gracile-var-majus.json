    "intro": "Brachypodium gracile var. majus, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
