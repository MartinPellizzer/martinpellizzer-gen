    "intro": "Baccharoides pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its adaptability to saline and windy conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline."
