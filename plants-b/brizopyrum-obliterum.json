It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often densely packed with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive sheath at the base, contributing to its overall appearance."
