    "intro": "Buchanania reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined Buchanania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
