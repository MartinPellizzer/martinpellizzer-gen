    "intro": "Bulbostylis palustris, commonly known as the marsh bulbhead, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or pale brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Bulbostylis palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
