    "intro": "Begonia polyclada, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features upright, branching stems that produce opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, enhancing its ornamental value in shaded environments."
