    "intro": "Bromopsis cappadocica subsp. sclerophylla, commonly known as the Cappadocian rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, wiry foliage, which is adapted to the arid and rocky conditions of its native habitat. The plant typically grows in limestone soils and is well-suited to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and have a leathery texture, a feature common in sclerophyllous plants. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and inconspicuous compared to the robust vegetative structures."
