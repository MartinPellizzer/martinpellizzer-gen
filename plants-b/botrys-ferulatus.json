    "intro": "Botrys ferulatus, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in cymes, giving it a distinctive, clustered appearance. Botrys ferulatus is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
