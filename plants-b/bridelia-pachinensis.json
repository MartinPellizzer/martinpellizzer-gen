    "intro": "Bridelia pachinensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Bridelia pachinensis is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
