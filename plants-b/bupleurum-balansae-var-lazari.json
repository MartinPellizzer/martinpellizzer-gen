    "intro": "Bupleurum balansae var. lazari, commonly known as the Lazari bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the Apiaceae family. This variant is of interest in botany due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
