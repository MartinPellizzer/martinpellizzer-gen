    "intro": "Banksia chamaephyton, commonly known as the low banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive inflorescences, which are cylindrical and composed of numerous yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Banksia chamaephyton plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
