    "intro": "Banksia concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces woody cones that remain on the plant for many years. Banksia concinna is adapted to fire-prone environments and relies on heat to release its seeds. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
