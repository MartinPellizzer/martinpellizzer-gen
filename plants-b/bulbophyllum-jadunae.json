    "intro": "Bulbophyllum jadunae, commonly known as the Jaduna's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
