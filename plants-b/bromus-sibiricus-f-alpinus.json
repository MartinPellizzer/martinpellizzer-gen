    "intro": "Bromus sibiricus f. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant typically forms dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients."
