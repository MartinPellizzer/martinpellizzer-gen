    "intro": "Bromus ligusticus, commonly known as the Ligurian brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Bromus ligusticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
