    "intro": "Bouteloua rahmeri, commonly known as Prairie grass or Silver Bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. Its foliage is typically bluish-green, and it forms dense, tufted clumps that help prevent soil erosion. Bouteloua rahmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
