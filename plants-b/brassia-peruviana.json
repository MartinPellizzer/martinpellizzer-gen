    "intro": "Brassia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain water in its native habitat. Brassia peruviana is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
