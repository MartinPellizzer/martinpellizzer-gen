    "intro": "Baphia haematoxylon, commonly known as Indian sandarac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that exudes a resin when cut. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Its bark is the primary source of the resin, which has been historically used in varnishes and as a medicinal herb. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in its native habitats."
