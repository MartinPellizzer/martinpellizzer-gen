    "intro": "Bystropogon maderensis var. schmitzii, commonly known as the Madeira lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
