    "intro": "Begonia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Begonia dichotoma thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
