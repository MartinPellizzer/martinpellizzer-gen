    "intro": "Baccharis rupicola var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
