    "intro": "Bidens eatonii, commonly known as Eaton's tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods and along stream banks. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens eatonii is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
