    "intro": "Brochoneura chapelieri, commonly known as the Cape Verde orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Santiago in the Cape Verde archipelago. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and a single, slender stem. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet-blue color and a complex, intricate structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's arid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
