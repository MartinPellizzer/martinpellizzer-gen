    "intro": "Bulbophyllum menglaense, commonly known as the Mengla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring three sepals and three petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
