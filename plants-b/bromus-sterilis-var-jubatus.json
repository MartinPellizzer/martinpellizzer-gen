    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. jubatus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple, and its inflorescence is typically open and branched. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
