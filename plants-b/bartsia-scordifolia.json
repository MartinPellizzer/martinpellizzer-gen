    "intro": "Bartsia scordifolia, commonly known as the stinking bartsia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Bartsia scordifolia is characterized by its distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is likely an adaptation to attract specific pollinators."
