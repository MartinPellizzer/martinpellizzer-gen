    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nematocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in variable conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and yellow."
