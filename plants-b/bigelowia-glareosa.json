    "intro": "Bigelowia glareosa, commonly known as the glaucous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive violet or purple throat. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance and help reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or streamside habitats. Bigelowia glareosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
