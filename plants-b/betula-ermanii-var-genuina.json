It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and serrated, turning yellow in the autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
