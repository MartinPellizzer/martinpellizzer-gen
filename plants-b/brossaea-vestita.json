    "intro": "Brossaea vestita, commonly known as the naked brossaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in dense clusters, often surrounded by velvety, hairy leaves. Brossaea vestita thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
