    "intro": "Belloa piptolepis, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy soils. Belloa piptolepis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry streambeds, where it spreads through rhizomes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
