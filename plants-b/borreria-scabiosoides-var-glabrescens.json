    "intro": "Borreria scabiosoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrescens\" suggests a reduction or loss of these hairs compared to the typical form. This plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
