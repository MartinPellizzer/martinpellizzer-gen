    "intro": "Belamcanda flabellata, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, forming a cup-like shape. The plant has basal leaves that are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and aid in propagation. Belamcanda flabellata is often found in moist soils near streams or in wet meadows, making it a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
