    "intro": "Bromus requienii, commonly known as the Requien's brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its spikelets are arranged in dense clusters, and the leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Bromus requienii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and foliage."
