It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
