    "intro": "Begonia parvipeltata, commonly known as the small-leaved begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
