    "intro": "Baccharis brachylaenoides var. mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and showy, yellowish-white flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
