    "intro": "Blechnum underwoodianum var. ekmanii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Blechnum genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
