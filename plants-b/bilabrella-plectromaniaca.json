    "intro": "Bilabrella plectromaniaca, commonly known as the moonlit bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep violet. The plant features two prominent lips on its floral tube, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
