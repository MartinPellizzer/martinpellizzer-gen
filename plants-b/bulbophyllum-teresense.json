    "intro": "Bulbophyllum teresense, commonly known as the rounded bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture. The flowers, which are often white or pale yellow, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators."
