    "intro": "Blitum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant features silvery-blue leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces spiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Blitum maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
