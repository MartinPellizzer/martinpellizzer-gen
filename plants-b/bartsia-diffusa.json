It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grassy areas.
