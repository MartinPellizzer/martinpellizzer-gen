    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique, pinnately divided fronds that resemble a moon or a shield, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a delicate, spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of its fronds. This variant is native to western North America and is often found in regions with cool, humid climates."
