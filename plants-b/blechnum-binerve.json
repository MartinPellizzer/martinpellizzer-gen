    "intro": "Blechnum binerve, commonly known as the two-veined hakea, is a fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely divided and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum binerve is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
