It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in specialized greenhouse settings."
