    "intro": "Boschniakia handelii f. minor, commonly known as the lesser boschniakia, is a rare and striking orchid-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, reddish-brown pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects, a feature known as mimicry. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts who appreciate its unusual appearance and botanical interest."
