    "intro": "Bacopa lanigera var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as carpet grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, producing dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spikes, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
