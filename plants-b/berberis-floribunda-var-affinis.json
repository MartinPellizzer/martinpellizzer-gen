    "intro": "Berberis floribunda var. affinis, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and vibrant seasonal color make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and borders."
