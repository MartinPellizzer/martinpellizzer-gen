    "intro": "Bromus rigidus var. ambigens, commonly known as the rigid brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense tufts and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
