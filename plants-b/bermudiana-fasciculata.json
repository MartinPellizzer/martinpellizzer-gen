    "intro": "Bermudiana fasciculata, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense growth habit, which makes it highly competitive in various environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form thick mats. Due to its adaptability, it is commonly used in lawns and for erosion control in sandy soils."
