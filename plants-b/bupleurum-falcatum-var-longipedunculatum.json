    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-pedunculate bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, supporting clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are typically blue or purple in color. This variety is notable for its long peduncles, which are the flower-bearing stalks, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments."
