    "intro": "Bulbophyllum uroglossum, commonly known as the \"Coral Spike Orchid,\" is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, dark green pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, coral-red or pink inflorescences with narrow, lance-shaped flowers. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal coating that aids in nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
