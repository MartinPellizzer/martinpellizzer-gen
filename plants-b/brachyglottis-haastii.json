    "intro": "Brachyglottis haastii, commonly known as the Haast's brachyglottis, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, silver-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
