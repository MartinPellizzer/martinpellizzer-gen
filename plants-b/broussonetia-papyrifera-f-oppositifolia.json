    "intro": "Broussonetia papyrifera f. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf paper mulberry, is a variant of the paper mulberry plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which distinguishes it from the typical alternate leaf pattern of the species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by hairy, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, making them useful for papermaking. The botanical features of this form contribute to its ecological and historical significance in traditional crafts."
