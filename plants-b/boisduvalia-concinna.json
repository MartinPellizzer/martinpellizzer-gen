    "intro": "Boisduvalia concinna, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland habitats. Boisduvalia concinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
