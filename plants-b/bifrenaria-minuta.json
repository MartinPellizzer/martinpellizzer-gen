    "intro": "Bifrenaria minuta, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Bifrenaria minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
