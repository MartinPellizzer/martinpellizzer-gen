    "intro": "Bursa occidentalis, commonly known as the western burr, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, seed-producing structures called burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Bursa occidentalis is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
