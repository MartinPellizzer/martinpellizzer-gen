    "intro": "Bupleurum kailashiense, commonly known as the Kailash bupleurum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
