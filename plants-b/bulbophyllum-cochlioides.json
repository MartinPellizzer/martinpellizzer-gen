    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cochlioides, commonly known as the Orchid with a Twist, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, spirally twisted pseudobulbs and dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
