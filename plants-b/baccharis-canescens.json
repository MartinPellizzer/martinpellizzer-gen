    "intro": "Baccharis canescens, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open areas such as grasslands and woodlands. Baccharis canescens is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
