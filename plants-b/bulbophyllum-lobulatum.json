    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lobulatum, commonly known as the \"Coral Spike Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
