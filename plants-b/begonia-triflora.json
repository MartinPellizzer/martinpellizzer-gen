    "intro": "Begonia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value, Begonia triflora is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
