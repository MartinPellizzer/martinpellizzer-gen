    "intro": "Bryaspis, commonly known as the moss fern, is a genus of small, primitive plants belonging to the order Bryopsidales. These plants are characterized by their simple, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Bryaspis species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They reproduce through spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and provide valuable insights into early plant evolution."
