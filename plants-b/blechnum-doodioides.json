    "intro": "Blechnum doodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
