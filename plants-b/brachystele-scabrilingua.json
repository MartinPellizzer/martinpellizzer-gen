    "intro": "Brachystele scabrilingua, commonly known as the rough-tongued stiltroot, is a unique member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is particularly adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
