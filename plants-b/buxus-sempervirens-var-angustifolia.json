    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a compact form make it ideal for formal garden designs."
