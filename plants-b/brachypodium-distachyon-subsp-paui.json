    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon subsp. paui, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This subspecies is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets. Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid life cycle, it is widely used in plant research for studying genome structure and function."
