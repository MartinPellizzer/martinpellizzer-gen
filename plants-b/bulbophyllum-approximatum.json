    "intro": "Bulbophyllum approximatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
