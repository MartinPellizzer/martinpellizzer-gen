    "intro": "Brevoortia, commonly known as the Atlantic croaker, is a genus of fish rather than a plant, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. However, if you were referring to a plant with a similar name, please clarify. If you meant a different organism, I would be happy to provide information. For now, I must note that Brevoortia is not a plant. I can't reply."
