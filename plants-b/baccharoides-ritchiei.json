    "intro": "Baccharoides ritchiei, commonly known as the Florida baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. It is also used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience to flooding."
