    "intro": "Batrachium sphaerospermum, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, with leaves arranged in a dense, globular structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf-like structures called gemma cups. Batrachium sphaerospermum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
