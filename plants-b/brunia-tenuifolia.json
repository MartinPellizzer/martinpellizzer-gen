    "intro": "Brunia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf brunia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It features small, narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Brunia tenuifolia is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
