    "intro": "Breynia kitanovii, commonly known as the Kitanov's breynia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It often grows in rocky soils and is sometimes found in disturbed areas. Breynia kitanovii is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
