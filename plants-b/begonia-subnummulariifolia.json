    "intro": "Begonia subnummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive silvery-white to pale green coloration due to dense trichomes. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardening."
