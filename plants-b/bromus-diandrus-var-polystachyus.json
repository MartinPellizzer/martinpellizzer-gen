    "intro": "Bromus diandrus var. polystachyus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and fibrous, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
