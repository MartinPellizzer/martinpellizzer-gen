    "intro": "Butonica, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the genus Asclepias and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains latex-like compounds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to purple flowers. Its flowers are pollinated by butterflies, particularly the monarch butterfly, which relies on its seeds for reproduction. Butonica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
