    "intro": "Blechnum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, narrow, strap-like fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively."
