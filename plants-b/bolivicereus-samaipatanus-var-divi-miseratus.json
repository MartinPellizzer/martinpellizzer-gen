    "intro": "Bolivicereus samaipatanus var. divi-miseratus, commonly known as the \"Cactus of Suffering,\" is a rare and striking cactus native to Bolivia. It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface and spiny areoles that bear short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
