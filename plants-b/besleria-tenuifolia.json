    "intro": "Besleria tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf besleria, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting dark veins. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
