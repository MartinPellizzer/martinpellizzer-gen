It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-swaying appearance."
