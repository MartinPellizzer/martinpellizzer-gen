    "intro": "Baphia, commonly known as the African snailwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Baphia species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in terminal inflorescences. The fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds, contributing to the plant's propagation in its natural habitat."
