It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy, and often colorful leaves that can range from green to yellow or orange. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, emerge from the center of the leaf rosette and are short-lived but highly visible.
