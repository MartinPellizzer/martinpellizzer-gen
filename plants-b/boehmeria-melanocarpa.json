    "intro": "Boehmeria melanocarpa, commonly known as black mulberry, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fibrous stems have been used historically for making textiles and paper."
