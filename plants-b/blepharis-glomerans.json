    "intro": "Blepharis glomerans, commonly known as the clustered fairy-tail, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive, whorled arrangement of flowers. Blepharis glomerans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
