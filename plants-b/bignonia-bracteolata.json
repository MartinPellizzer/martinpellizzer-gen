    "intro": "Bignonia bracteolata, commonly known as the yellow shower vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that can climb by twining around supports, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. Bignonia bracteolata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide vertical interest in gardens."
