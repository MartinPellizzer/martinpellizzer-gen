    "intro": "Boretta cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian broom, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in mild, moist climates. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Boretta cantabrica is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
