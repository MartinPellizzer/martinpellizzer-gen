    "intro": "Balania involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive yellow or red throat. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warm seasons, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Balania involucrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
