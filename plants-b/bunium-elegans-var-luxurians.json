    "intro": "Bunium elegans var. luxurians, commonly known as the fragrant mountain fennel, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces slender, branched stems topped with small, yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong, licorice-like scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic properties."
