    "intro": "Bidens petiolata, commonly known as the slender beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with characteristic ray florets, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. It is known for its ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in wetland areas. Bidens petiolata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
