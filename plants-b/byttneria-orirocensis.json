    "intro": "Byttneria orirocensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
