    "intro": "Begonia manuselaensis, commonly known as the Manusela begonia, is a rare tropical plant native to the island of Manusela in Indonesia. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, velvety foliage that ranges from deep green to purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
