    "intro": "Bupleurum petraeum subvar. incurvum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its roots are used in traditional medicine. This subvariety is distinguished by its incurved flower buds, which open sequentially as the plant matures."
