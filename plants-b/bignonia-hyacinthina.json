    "intro": "Bignonia hyacinthina, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous climbing plant native to South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb or trail along structures. Bignonia hyacinthina is valued in gardens for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in full sun."
