    "intro": "Baccharis \u00d7 demissa, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
