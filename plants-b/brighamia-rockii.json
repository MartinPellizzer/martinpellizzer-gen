    "intro": "Brighamia rockii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid native habitat. Brighamia rockii is often found growing in rocky areas or on coastal cliffs. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
