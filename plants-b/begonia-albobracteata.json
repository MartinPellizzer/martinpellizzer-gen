    "intro": "Begonia albobracteata, commonly known as the white bract begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts, which are white and contribute to its ornamental appeal. These bracts are not only visually distinctive but also serve to attract pollinators. Begonia albobracteata thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
