    "intro": "Bombax longiflorum f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant cotton tree, is a variant of the cotton tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. The plant is a deciduous tree with a broad, spreading canopy and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release fluffy seeds, similar to the main species Bombax longiflorum."
