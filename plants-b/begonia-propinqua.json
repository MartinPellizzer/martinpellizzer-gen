It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings due to its ornamental value."
