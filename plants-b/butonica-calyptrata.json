    "intro": "Butonica calyptrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along roadsides or in agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many tropical environments. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts used in traditional remedies."
