It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
