    "intro": "Banksia spicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern and southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Banksia spicata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or dry forest habitats. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its region."
