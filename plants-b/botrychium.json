    "intro": "Botrychium, commonly known as the moonwort, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Botrychiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique fronds that often resemble a cluster of grapes, hence the genus name derived from the Greek word \"botrys,\" meaning grape. Botrychium species are typically small, herbaceous plants that thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. They have a simple, primitive structure with a single, often spirally arranged frond that bears sporangia on the underside. Botrychium is notable for its ancient lineage, with some species dating back to the Carboniferous period."
