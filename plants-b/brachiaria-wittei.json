    "intro": "Brachiaria wittei, commonly known as the African grass or Witte's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green coloration. Brachiaria wittei is widely used in livestock forage and has ecological importance in stabilizing soils in degraded areas."
