    "intro": "Bromus variegatus subsp. villosulus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
