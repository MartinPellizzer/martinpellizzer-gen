It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a common component of arid landscape designs."
