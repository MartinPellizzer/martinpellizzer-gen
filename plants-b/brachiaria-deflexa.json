    "intro": "Brachiaria deflexa, commonly known as the flexed blady grass, is a tropical and subtropical perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that often curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Brachiaria deflexa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along waterways. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
