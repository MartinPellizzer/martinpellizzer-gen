    "intro": "Boehmeria formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance. The plant's unique feature is its ability to attract and nurture ants, which in turn protect it from herbivores. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain seeds."
