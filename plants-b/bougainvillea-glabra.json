    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra, commonly known as the common bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, orange, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The actual flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in dense inflorescences called cyathia. This plant thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. It requires well-draining soil and full sun to produce its colorful bracts."
