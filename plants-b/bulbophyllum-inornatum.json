It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a plain, unadorned lip, which is characteristic of its species name. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Bulbophyllum inornatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
