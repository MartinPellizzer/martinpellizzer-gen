    "intro": "Buddleja multiceps, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking, panicle-like inflorescences that produce fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja multiceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
