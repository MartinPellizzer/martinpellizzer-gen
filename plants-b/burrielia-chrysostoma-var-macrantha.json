It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
