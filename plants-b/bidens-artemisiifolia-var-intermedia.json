    "intro": "Bidens artemisiifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
