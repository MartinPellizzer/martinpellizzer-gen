    "intro": "Boswellia thurifera, commonly known as frankincense or olibanum, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is harvested and used in incense, perfumes, and traditional medicine. This sap, known as frankincense, is obtained by making incisions in the tree's bark. Boswellia thurifera plays a significant role in both ecological and cultural contexts due to its aromatic properties and historical use."
