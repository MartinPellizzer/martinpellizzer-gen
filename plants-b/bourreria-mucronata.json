    "intro": "Bourreria mucronata, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a perennial shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
