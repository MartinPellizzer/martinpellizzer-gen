    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed glumes and three-awned lemmas. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with short hairs, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Bromus erectus var. reptans is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
