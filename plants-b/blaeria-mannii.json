    "intro": "Blaeria mannii, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Its leaves are strap-shaped and emerge from the base, forming a rosette structure. Blaeria mannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
