    "intro": "Banara trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidadian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries containing a single seed. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is also considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
