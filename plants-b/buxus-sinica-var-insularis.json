    "intro": "Buxus sinica var. insularis, commonly known as the island boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and finely textured. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat form make it ideal for topiary and hedging."
