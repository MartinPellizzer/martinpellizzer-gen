    "intro": "Brassia wageneri, commonly known as the Wagener's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Brassia wageneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
