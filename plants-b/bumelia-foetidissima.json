    "intro": "Bumelia foetidissima, commonly known as stinkwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which contributes to its common name. The species is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been used historically for various purposes."
