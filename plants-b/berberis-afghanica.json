    "intro": "Berberis afghanica, commonly known as Afghan barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features thorny stems with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Berberis afghanica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties."
