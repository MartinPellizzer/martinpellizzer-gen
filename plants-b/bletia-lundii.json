    "intro": "Bletia lundii, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
