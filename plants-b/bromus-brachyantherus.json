It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Bromus brachyantherus is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
