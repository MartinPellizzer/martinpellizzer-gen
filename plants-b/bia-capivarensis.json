It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Bia capivarensis is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
