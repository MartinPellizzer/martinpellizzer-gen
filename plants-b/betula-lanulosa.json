    "intro": "Betula lanulosa, commonly known as the downy birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. Betula lanulosa thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
