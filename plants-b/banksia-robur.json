It is characterized by its woody, cone-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, providing a distinctive appearance. Banksia robur is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas."
