    "intro": "Bonnetia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its woody stems that often bear a dense covering of hairs. It thrives in the unique, high-altitude ecosystems of the tepuis, where it plays a role in the local flora and may be adapted to the specific environmental conditions of these isolated mountain ranges. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
