    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hyption, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structures, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, enhancing their visibility to pollinators. Bulbophyllum hyption thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural conditions."
