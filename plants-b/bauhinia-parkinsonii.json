    "intro": "Bauhinia parkinsonii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences make it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing as a tree or shrub. Bauhinia parkinsonii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
