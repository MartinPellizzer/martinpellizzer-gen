    "intro": "Bassia retusa, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early summer. Bassia retusa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in drought conditions."
