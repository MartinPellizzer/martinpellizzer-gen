    "intro": "Biebersteinia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Biebersteinia thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
