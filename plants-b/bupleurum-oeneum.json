    "intro": "Bupleurum oeneum, commonly known as the lesser celery or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to salt-laden environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of celery, while its small white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters. Bupleurum oeneum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
