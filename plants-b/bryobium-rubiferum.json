    "intro": "Bryobium rubiferum, commonly known as the red-leaf bryobium, is a unique liverwort species belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and vibrant red to orange leaf colors, which are particularly noticeable during the growing season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Bryobium rubiferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in bog gardens and terrariums."
