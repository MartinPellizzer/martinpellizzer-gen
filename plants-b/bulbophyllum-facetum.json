    "intro": "Bulbophyllum facetum, commonly known as the wrinkled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often wrinkled or plicated leaves and strikingly colored, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, club-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. Bulbophyllum facetum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
