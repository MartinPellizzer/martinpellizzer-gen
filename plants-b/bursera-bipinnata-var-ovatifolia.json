    "intro": "Bursera bipinnata var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaf bursera, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry forests of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two sets of leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange, followed by resinous, aromatic fruits. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
