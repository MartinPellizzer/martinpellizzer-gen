    "intro": "Brayopsis alpaminae, commonly known as the alpine brayopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brayopsis alpaminae is considered a vulnerable species."
