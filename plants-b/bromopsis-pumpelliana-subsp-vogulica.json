    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. vogulica, commonly known as the Vogulian bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh, temperate to subarctic environments. Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. vogulica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations."
