    "intro": "Brachychiton acuminatus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to northern Australia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, bright red or orange flowers. The flowers are borne in dense, rounded clusters and bloom during the dry season, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun."
