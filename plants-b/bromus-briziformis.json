    "intro": "Bromus briziformis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus briziformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
