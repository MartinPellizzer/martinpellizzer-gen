    "intro": "Bhutanthera albosanguinea, commonly known as the Bhutanese white blood tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,200 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
