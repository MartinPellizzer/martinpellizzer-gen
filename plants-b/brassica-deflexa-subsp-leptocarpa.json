It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a distinct pubescence. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its tolerance of heavy metals."
