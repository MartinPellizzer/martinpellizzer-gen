It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that display a range of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. The flowers are often arranged in racemes and can bloom multiple times throughout the year."
