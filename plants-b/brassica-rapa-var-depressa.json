It is characterized by its low-growing, compact habit with rosettes of oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by spherical, pale siliques containing numerous seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine."
