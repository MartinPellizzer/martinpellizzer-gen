    "intro": "Bidens societatis, commonly known as the societyweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bidens societatis typically grows in moist, sunny habitats like wetlands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
