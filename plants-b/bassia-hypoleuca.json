    "intro": "Bassia hypoleuca, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has pale green, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a useful plant for erosion control in dry environments."
