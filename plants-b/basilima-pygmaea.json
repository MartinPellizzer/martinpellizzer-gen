It features delicate, aromatic leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and fragrant foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal remedies."
