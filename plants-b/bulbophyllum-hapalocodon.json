    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hapalocodon, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
