    "intro": "Buchnera divaricata, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in spikes, and are often pale green or yellowish in color. Buchnera divaricata plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and providing resources for certain insect species."
