    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. glabriflorus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved brome, is a grass species native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy leaves, which distinguish it from other brome species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with glabrous (hairless) flowers, contributing to its specific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in prairies and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
