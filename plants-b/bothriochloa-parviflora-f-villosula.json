It is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its hairy foliage and slender, erect stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This grass is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands."
