    "intro": "Berberis mianningensis, commonly known as the Mianning barberry, is a shrub native to China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
