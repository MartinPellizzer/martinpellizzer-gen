    "intro": "Borreria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate borreria, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Borreria prostrata is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
