It is characterized by its dense, rounded inflorescence composed of tightly packed flower buds, which are typically white, green, or purple in color. The plant produces a thick, fibrous stem and broad, dark green leaves that are edible. It thrives in cool climates and requires a long growing season to develop its distinctive head. Cauliflower is cultivated for its edible florets, which are harvested before the flowers open."
