    "intro": "Bernhardia capensis, commonly known as the Cape bernhardia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
