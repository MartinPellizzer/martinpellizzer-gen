    "intro": "Boechera pinetorum, commonly known as the mountain rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Boechera pinetorum is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh alpine conditions, making it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
