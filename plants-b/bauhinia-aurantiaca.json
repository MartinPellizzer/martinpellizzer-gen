The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and divided into numerous small leaflets. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Bauhinia aurantiica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly planted in gardens and as a street tree in warm climates."
