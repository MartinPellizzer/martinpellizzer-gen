    "intro": "Brachiaria numidiana, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for forage in livestock grazing. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
