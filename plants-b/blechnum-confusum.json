    "intro": "Blechnum confusum, commonly known as the confused maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
