    "intro": "Barbarea intermedia var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping winter cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
