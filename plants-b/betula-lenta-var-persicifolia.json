    "intro": "Betula lenta var. persicifolia, commonly known as the sweet birch with cherry-like leaves, is a variant of the sweet birch tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a vanilla-like scent when scratched. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellow-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
