    "intro": "Baccharis rufescens, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in the fall. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. Its ecological value is significant in arid and semi-arid regions."
