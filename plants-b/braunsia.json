It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant produces a bulbous root system that helps it store water and survive in dry conditions. Braunsia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting addition to gardens in warm climates."
