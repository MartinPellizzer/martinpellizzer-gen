    "intro": "Begonia chloroneura, commonly known as the green-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that feature prominent green veins against a pale green background. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
