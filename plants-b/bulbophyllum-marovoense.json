    "intro": "Bulbophyllum marovoense, commonly known as the Marovo Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Pacific islands, particularly in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. The flowers are often white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects."
