    "intro": "Begonia inversa, commonly known as the upside-down begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers are oriented downward, creating an unusual visual effect. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a distinctive tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Begonia inversa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
