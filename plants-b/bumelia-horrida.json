    "intro": "Bumelia horrida, commonly known as the roughbumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. Bumelia horrida is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
