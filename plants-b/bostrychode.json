    "intro": "Bostrychode, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a type of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, pointed leaflets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Bostrychode is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
