    "intro": "Bumelia affinis, commonly known as the Florida bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Bumelia affinis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
