It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are often aromatic and contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. The plant is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
