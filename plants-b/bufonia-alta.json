    "intro": "Bufonia alta, commonly known as the highland nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Bufonia alta is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both scientific and cautionary interest."
