    "intro": "Bellevalia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinct central vein, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bellevalia nervosa is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
