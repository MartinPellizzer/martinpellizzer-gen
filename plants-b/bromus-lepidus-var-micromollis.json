It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and the plant produces small, pale green to brown seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This variety is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
