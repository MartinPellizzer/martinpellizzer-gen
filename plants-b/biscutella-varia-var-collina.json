    "intro": "Biscutella varia var. collina, commonly known as the Alpine biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
