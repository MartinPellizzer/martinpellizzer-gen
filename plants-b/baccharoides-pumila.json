It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters during the late spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Baccharoides pumila is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
