    "intro": "Bunium piovanii, commonly known as the Piovan's fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, white to greenish flowers. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Bunium piovanii thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
