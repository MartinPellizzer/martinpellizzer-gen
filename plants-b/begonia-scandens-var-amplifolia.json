    "intro": "Begonia scandens var. amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved climbing begonia, is a tropical vine characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its trailing habit makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas. The foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
