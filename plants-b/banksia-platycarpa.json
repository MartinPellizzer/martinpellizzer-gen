    "intro": "Banksia platycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species native to southern Western Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring rough, flaky bark on its trunk. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and the plant is adapted to fire-prone environments. Banksia platycarpa plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for a variety of native pollinators."
