It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy. Busea species are native to regions across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
