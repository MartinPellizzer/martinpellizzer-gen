    "intro": "Belilla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Belilla is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in some regions."
