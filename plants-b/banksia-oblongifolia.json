    "intro": "Banksia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flower spikes that emerge from the axils of the leaves, typically in spring. These flowers are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing a vital role in pollination. The plant is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with serotinous cones that release seeds after a bushfire."
