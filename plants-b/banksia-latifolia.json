    "intro": "Banksia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwest of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia latifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common species in coastal and heathland environments. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
