It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Bassia salsoloides is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
