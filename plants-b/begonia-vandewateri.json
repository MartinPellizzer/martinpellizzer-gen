    "intro": "Begonia vandewateri, commonly known as the Vandewater begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-purple. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
