    "intro": "Brachypodium serpentini, commonly known as the serpentine grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often on serpentine substrates, which are rich in certain minerals and poor in others. Brachypodium serpentini is a perennial species that produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
