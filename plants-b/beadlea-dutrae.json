    "intro": "Beadlea dutrae, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Beadlea dutrae thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
