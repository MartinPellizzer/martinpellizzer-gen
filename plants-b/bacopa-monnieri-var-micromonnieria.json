    "intro": "Bacopa monnieri var. micromonnieria, commonly known as dwarf water hyssop, is a compact, creeping perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer to autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in traditional medicine."
