    "intro": "Bernardia pulchella f. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata form of the red-flowered bernardia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are borne in dense, terminal clusters and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
