    "intro": "Blechnum niponicum f. reflexipinnula, commonly known as the reflexed fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. It features long, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive reflexed (bent back) appearance on the underside. The plant is native to regions in Asia, particularly Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous growth habit and spore-producing sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
