    "intro": "Betula terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland birch, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas near the shoreline. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
