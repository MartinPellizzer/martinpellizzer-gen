    "intro": "Baccharis umbelliformis var. poeppigiana, commonly known as Poeppig's baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky slopes. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient species in its native range."
