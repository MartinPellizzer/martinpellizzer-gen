    "intro": "Briza rubra, commonly known as red feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, reddish stems with fine, grass-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish flowers in panicles, which are typically visible in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Briza rubra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
