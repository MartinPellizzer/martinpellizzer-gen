    "intro": "Bistorta carnea, commonly known as red bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Bistorta carnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
