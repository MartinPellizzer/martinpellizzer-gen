    "intro": "Bigelowia mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave bigelowia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as the Mojave Desert, where it has adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
