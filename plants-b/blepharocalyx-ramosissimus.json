It is characterized by its dense, often thorny branches and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
