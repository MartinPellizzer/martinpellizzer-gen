    "intro": "Bryonia pectinata, commonly known as the smooth bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features a trailing or climbing habit, with pale green, lobed leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a spiny, orange-brown capsule that contains toxic seeds, making it a plant of caution. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine, though with significant risks."
