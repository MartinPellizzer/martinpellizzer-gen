    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
