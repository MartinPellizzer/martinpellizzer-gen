    "intro": "Begonia cuspidata, commonly known as the pointed begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrast between its foliage and showy blooms."
