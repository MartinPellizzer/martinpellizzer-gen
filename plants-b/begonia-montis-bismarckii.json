    "intro": "Begonia montis-bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck Mountain begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Bismarck Mountain in New Guinea. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
