    "intro": "Bulbophyllum microlabium, commonly known as the small-lipped bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments within tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that is smaller than the other petals."
