    "intro": "Blatti leucantha, commonly known as the white blattid, is a species of cockroach belonging to the family Blattidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and pale coloration, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this species thrives in warm, humid environments. Its diet primarily consists of decaying plant matter and fungi, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its classification within the order Blattodea, which includes both cockroaches and termites."
