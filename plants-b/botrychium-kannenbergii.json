    "intro": "Botrychium kannenbergii, commonly known as the kanneberg's moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium kannenbergii is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
