    "intro": "Benzoin, commonly known as the resinous sap of the genus Styrax, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. The plant produces a fragrant, amber-colored resin that has been used for centuries in incense, perfumes, and traditional medicine. Its botanical features include glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The resin is harvested by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to exude and harden into a valuable substance. Benzoin's unique chemical composition includes compounds like benzoin and styrax, which contribute to its aromatic and therapeutic properties."
