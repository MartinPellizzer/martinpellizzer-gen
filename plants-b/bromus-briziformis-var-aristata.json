    "intro": "Bromus briziformis var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted inflorescences with spikelets that are often bristled at the tips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
