    "intro": "Blechnum distans var. meridionale, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to southern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly glossy surface, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
