    "intro": "Blechnum cartilagineum var. tropicum, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped, bright green leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant."
