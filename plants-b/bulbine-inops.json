    "intro": "Bulbine inops, commonly known as the rock lily, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, Bulbine inops is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
