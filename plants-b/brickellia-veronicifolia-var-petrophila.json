It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system to access groundwater. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils in rocky and desert habitats."
