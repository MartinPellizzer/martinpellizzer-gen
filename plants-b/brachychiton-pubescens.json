    "intro": "Brachychiton pubescens, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The bark is thick and often fissured, adding to its distinctive appearance."
