    "intro": "Banksia prionotes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia prionotes is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
