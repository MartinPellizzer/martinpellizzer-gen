    "intro": "Burlingtonia rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical in shape. Burlingtonia rosea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
