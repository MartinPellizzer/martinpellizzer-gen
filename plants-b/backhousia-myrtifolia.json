    "intro": "Backhousia myrtifolia, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a tropical rainforest plant native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications. The plant has small white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its leaves contain high levels of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. Backhousia myrtifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of eucalyptus forests."
