    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fletcherianum, commonly known as the Fletcher's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in survival in its natural habitat. The flowers typically have a complex structure with showy petals and a distinctive lip, which is a defining feature of many orchid species."
