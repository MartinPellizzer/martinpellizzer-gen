    "intro": "Begonia malvacea, commonly known as the Malvaceae begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
