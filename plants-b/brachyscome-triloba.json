It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Brachyscome triloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
