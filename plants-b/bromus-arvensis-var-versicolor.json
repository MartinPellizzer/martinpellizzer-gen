    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable field brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled seeds. This variety is notable for its variable coloration in the inflorescence, ranging from green to reddish or purple hues."
