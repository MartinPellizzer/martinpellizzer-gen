    "intro": "Begonia crassitepala, commonly known as the broad-leaved begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
