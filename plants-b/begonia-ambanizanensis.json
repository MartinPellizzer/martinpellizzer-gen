It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that display intricate patterns and colors. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically red or pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
