    "intro": "Buddleja \u00d7 luteolufaucia, commonly known as the golden fringe. This hybrid plant is a cross between Buddleja fisciana and Buddleja lutea, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parent species. It is a deciduous shrub that produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers, which are highly attractive to butterflies and other pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
