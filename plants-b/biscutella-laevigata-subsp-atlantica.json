    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in maritime climates with mild temperatures and high humidity. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
