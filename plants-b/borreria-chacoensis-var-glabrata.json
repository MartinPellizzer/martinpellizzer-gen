It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrata has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils."
