    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
