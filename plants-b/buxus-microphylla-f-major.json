    "intro": "Buxus microphylla f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved boxwood, is a cultivar of the boxwood plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical boxwood, which gives it a more open and airy appearance. The plant is evergreen, with dense, compact growth that makes it ideal for topiary and hedging. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, and it is relatively slow-growing, requiring minimal pruning. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to maintain a neat shape over time."
