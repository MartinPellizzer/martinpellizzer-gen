    "intro": "Bromus mollis f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that are well adapted to dry, rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Its compact form makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat for small invertebrates."
