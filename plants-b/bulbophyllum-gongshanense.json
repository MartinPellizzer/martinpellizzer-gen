    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gongshanense, commonly known as the Gongshan orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with colorful petals and a distinctive lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
