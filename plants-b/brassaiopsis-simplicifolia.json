    "intro": "Brassaiopsis simplicifolia, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lacy fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
