    "intro": "Bromopsis indurata subsp. nachiczevanica, commonly known as the Nachiczevan bromus, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is part of the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
