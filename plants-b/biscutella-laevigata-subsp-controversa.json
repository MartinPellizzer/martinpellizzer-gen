It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of B. laevigata."
