    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. americanum, commonly known as the American moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, knob-like structure at the base of the fronds. This species is often found in the northeastern United States and is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
