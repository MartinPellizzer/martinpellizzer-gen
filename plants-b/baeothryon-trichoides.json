    "intro": "Baeothryon trichoides, commonly known as the slender-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant has a highly branched, root-like structure called a haustorium, which attaches to the host's vascular system. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green in color. Baeothryon trichoides is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often in dry, disturbed soils."
