    "intro": "Bosqueia occidentalis, commonly known as the western bosqueia, is a low-growing shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. These flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bosqueia occidentalis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
