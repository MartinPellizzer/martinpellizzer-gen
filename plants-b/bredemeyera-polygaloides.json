It features lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
