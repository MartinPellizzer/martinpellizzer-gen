    "intro": "Bactris duidae, commonly known as the pink pineapple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its clustered, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bactris duidae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for both its fruit and foliage."
