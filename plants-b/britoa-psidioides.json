    "intro": "Britoa psidioides, commonly known as the dwarf guava, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, citrus-scented fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
