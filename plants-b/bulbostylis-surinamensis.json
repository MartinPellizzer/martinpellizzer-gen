    "intro": "Bulbostylis surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. Bulbostylis surinamensis is native to South America, particularly Suriname and neighboring regions."
