    "intro": "Barosma pulchella var. major, commonly known as the large barosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Restionaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, clustered white flowers during the summer months. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. This variant is distinguished from the typical Barosma pulchella by its larger leaves and more robust growth habit."
