    "intro": "Bromus hookeri var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often adorned with long, awned bracts. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh, mountainous habitats."
