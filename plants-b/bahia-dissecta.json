    "intro": "Bahia dissecta, commonly known as the dissected bahia grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive, finely dissected appearance. Bahia dissecta is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
