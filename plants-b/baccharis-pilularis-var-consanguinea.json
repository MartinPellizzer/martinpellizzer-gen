It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that appear in clusters during the late spring and summer. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-tolerant gardens."
