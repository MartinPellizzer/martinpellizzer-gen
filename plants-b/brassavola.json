    "intro": "Brassavola, commonly known as the lady's tresses orchid, is a genus of orchids native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their dense, grass-like leaves and intricate, spiraled flower spikes. The flowers typically range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. Brassavola species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and resilience."
