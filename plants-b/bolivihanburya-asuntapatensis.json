    "intro": "Bolivihanburya asuntapatensis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
