    "intro": "Becquerelia glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, woolly thallus that forms clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and algae or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in undisturbed forest ecosystems."
