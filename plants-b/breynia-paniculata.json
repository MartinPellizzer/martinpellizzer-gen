    "intro": "Breynia paniculata, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and striking, red-orange inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Breynia paniculata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with its succulent-like leaves helping it conserve water. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
