    "intro": "Bulbophyllum divergens, commonly known as the spreading bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet fragrance. Bulbophyllum divergens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
