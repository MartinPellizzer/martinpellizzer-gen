    "intro": "Baccharis oblongifolia var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and persistent foliage make it a hardy species suitable for coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
