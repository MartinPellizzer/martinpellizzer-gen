    "intro": "Beaufortia aestiva, commonly known as the coastal beaufortia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Beaufortia aestiva plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for native wildlife."
