It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that are typically upright and lance-shaped. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, including South America, Africa, and Australia. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
