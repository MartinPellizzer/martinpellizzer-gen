It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall delicate appearance.
