    "intro": "Braya humilis subsp. ventosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Braya humilis subsp. ventosa is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
