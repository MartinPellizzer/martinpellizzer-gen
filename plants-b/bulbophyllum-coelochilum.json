    "intro": "Bulbophyllum coelochilum, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow and green flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This orchid is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation."
