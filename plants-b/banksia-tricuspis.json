    "intro": "Banksia tricuspis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Banksia tricuspis is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with a lignotuber that allows it to resprout after bushfires. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
