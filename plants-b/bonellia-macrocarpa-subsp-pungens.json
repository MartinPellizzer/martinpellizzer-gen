It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its sharp, spiny leaves and fruits, which are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. This plant is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
