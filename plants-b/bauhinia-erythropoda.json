    "intro": "Bauhinia erythropoda, commonly known as the red-veined bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are pod-like structures that split open to release seeds. Bauhinia erythropoda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
