    "intro": "Bigelovia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bigelovia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
