    "intro": "Bridelia cathartica subsp. melanthesoides, commonly known as blackwood or African blackwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for carving and furniture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
