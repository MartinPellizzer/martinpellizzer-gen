    "intro": "Bellevalia variabilis, commonly known as the variable bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bellevalia variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
