    "intro": "Brassia verrucosa, commonly known as the warty orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, warty, and often hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Brassia verrucosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
