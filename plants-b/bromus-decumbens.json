    "intro": "Bromus decumbens, commonly known as the lying brome, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Bromus decumbens is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other open areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
