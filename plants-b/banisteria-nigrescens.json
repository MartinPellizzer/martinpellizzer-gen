    "intro": "Banisteria nigrescens, commonly known as the black-barked bignon, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of hair for wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Banisteria nigrescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and vigorous growth habit."
