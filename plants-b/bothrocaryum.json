    "intro": "Bothrocaryum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their aromatic resinous sap, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. They typically grow as small trees or shrubs with smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature."
