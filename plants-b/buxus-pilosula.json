    "intro": "Buxus pilosula, commonly known as the silky boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is prized in horticulture for its compact form and ability to tolerate pruning. Buxus pilosula thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
