    "intro": "Baukea, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous regions. The plants are shrubs with small, needle-like leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red. Baukea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. They are also valued for their resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
