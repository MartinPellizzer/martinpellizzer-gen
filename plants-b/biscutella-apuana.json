    "intro": "Biscutella apuana, commonly known as the Apuan bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Italy. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Biscutella apuana is considered a vulnerable species."
