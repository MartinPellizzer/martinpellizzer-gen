    "intro": "Bridelia oblongifolius, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that appear in spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
