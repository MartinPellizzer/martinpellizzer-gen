    "intro": "Betula resinifera, commonly known as the resin birch, is a species of birch native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a small tree or shrub characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, often pendulous branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Betula resinifera is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its resinous sap has been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including as a source of waterproofing and medicine."
