It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, fields, and in open woodlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects."
