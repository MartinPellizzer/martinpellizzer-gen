    "intro": "Botrys subglabrus, commonly known as the smooth-clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with tiny, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in loose clusters. Botrys subglabrus thrives in still or slow-moving water and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
