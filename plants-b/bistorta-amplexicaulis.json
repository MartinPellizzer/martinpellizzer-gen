    "intro": "Bistorta amplexicaulis, commonly known as broad-leaved bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rhizomatous root system and its distinctive, basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers in early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Bistorta amplexicaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats."
