    "intro": "Buddleja americana, commonly known as the American butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically purple to pink in color and are highly attractive to butterflies and other pollinators. The plant has smooth, gray-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and can reach up to 10 inches in length. Buddleja americana is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
