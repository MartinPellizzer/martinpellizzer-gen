    "intro": "Begonia quadrialata, commonly known as the four-veined begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins that run in four distinct directions, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
