    "intro": "Bidens biternata var. mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Jamaica and Cuba. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as roadside verges and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
