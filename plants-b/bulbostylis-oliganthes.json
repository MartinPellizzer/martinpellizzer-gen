    "intro": "Bulbostylis oliganthes, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. Bulbostylis oliganthes is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies."
