It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the wet season. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
