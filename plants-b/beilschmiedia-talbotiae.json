    "intro": "Beilschmiedia talbotiae, commonly known as the Talbot's beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by round, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
