It features small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often resembling tiny bells. The leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
