    "intro": "Blechnum lanceolatum var. squamipes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with a silvery, scaly appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in native ecosystems."
