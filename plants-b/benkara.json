    "intro": "Benkara, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, winding stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, absorbing nutrients from the water. Benkara is often associated with purity and spiritual significance in various cultures."
