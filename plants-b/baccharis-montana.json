It typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Baccharis montana is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
