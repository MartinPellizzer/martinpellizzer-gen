    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bifarium, commonly known as the two-flowered bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Bulbophyllum bifarium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
