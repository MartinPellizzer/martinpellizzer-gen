    "intro": "Berberis irritabilis, commonly known as the irritant barberry, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to the plant's irritant properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
