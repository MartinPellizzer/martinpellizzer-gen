    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid found in tropical regions. It is characterized by its unique ability to grow on mangrove trees, utilizing them as a substrate for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
