    "intro": "Bouteloua annua, commonly known as annual bluegrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a short-lived perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. The plant has fine, blue-green blades and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its life cycle is adapted to seasonal changes, with seeds germinating in spring and the plant dying back in winter. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
