    "intro": "Brachiaria rugulosa, commonly known as silky grass or Brazilian signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Brachiaria rugulosa is often used in pastures and erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
