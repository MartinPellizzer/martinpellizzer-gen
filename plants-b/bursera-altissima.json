    "intro": "Bursera altissima, commonly known as the gum tree or sweet gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical environment. Bursera altissima is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes."
