    "intro": "Byrsonima inundata, commonly known as water hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its rough, sometimes thorny bark. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in moist environments."
