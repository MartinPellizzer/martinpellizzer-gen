    "intro": "Bulbophyllum minutissimum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small plant with delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces tiny, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
