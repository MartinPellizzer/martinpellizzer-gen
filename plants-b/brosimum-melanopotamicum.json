    "intro": "Brosimum melanopotamicum, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and ability to produce latex. The plant is often found in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. Its latex has historically been used for various industrial purposes, though its commercial use has declined in recent years. The tree plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
