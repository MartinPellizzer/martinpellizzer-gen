    "intro": "Banisteria latifolia var. paraguariensis, commonly known as Ayahuasca, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its most notable feature is the presence of the psychoactive alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in its leaves. This species is traditionally used in shamanic rituals for its hallucinogenic effects."
