It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding a striking visual appeal to gardens.
