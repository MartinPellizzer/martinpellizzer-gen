    "intro": "Betula dioica, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra or boreal forest ecosystems. Betula dioica plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
