    "intro": "Berberis neglecta, commonly known as the California barberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features thorny stems covered in small, yellowish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a slightly serrated edge. Berberis neglecta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
