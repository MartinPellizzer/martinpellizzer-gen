    "intro": "Brachystemum linifolium, commonly known as coastal brome, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Brachystemum linifolium is often found in association with other halophytic plants in coastal ecosystems."
