    "intro": "Bahiopsis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, followed by inflated, seed-containing pods that persist into autumn. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
