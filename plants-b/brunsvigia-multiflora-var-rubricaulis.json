It features striking, tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bear clusters of vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn reddish in color during the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.
