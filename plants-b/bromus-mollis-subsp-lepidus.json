    "intro": "Bromus mollis subsp. lepidus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various environments. The species is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a common component of native plant communities."
