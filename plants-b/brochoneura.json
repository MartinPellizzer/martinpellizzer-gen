    "intro": "Brochoneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Brochoneura is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
