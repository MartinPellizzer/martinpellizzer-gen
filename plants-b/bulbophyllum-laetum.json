    "intro": "Bulbophyllum laetum, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically elongated and fleshy, adapted for efficient water retention. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and long-lasting blooms."
