    "intro": "Boehmeria umbrosa, commonly known as the dark boehmeria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Boehmeria umbrosa is also valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used in the production of textiles and paper in some cultures."
