    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria f. tripartitum, commonly known as the three-part moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate fronds that resemble a cluster of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a relic from ancient plant lineages."
