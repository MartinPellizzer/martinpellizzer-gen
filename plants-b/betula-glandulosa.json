    "intro": "Betula glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are clustered in soft, woolly cones. Betula glandulosa thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of subalpine and montane ecosystems."
