    "intro": "Baccharis decurrens, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its fast growth rate and drought tolerance make it useful for erosion control and as a landscape plant. Additionally, it serves as a food source for various insects and birds."
