    "intro": "Bromus secalinus f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous brome, is a variant of the annual brome grass. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, distinguishing it from other forms of Bromus secalinus. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas or along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. The glabrous form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological roles."
