    "intro": "Brachyclados, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brachyclados is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
