It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest regions."
