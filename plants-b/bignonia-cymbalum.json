    "intro": "Bignonia cymbalum, commonly known as the yellow cross vine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 30 feet, adorned with heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with orange markings, blooming from spring to summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover, though it can become invasive if not managed. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
