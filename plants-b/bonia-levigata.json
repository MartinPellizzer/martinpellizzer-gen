    "intro": "Bonia levigata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
