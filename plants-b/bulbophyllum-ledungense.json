    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ledungense, commonly known as the Ledungens ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its long, thin pseudobulbs and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, often resembling ghostly shapes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
