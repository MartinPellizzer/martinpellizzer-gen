    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. matricariifolium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a crescent moon, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a single, terminal structure called a sorus, which is often covered by a protective indusium. This variety is known for its delicate, herbaceous foliage and its role in forest ecosystems."
