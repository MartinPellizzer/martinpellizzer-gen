    "intro": "Boechera vivariensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually basal and rosette-forming, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Boechera vivariensis is also notable for its genetic diversity and role in ecological studies related to plant adaptation."
