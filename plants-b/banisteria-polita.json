It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain edible, sour-tasting seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
