    "intro": "Bubbia sororia, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bubbia sororia is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained environments."
