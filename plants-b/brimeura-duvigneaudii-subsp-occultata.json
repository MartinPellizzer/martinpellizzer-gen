    "intro": "Brimeura duvigneaudii subsp. occultata, commonly known as the hidden brimeura, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its compact growth form and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in alpine ecosystems."
