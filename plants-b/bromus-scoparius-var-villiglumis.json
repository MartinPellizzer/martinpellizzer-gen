It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
