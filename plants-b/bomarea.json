    "intro": "Bomarea, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Many species have tuberous roots, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. Bomarea plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often with rhizomatous or fibrous root systems."
