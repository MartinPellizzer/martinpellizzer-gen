    "intro": "Bermudiana weirii, commonly known as the Bermuda cedar, is a rare and ancient tree native to the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda. It is a member of the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of Bermuda's natural heritage. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and unique grain pattern, though it is now protected due to its endangered status. The plant plays a significant ecological role in Bermuda's coastal ecosystems."
