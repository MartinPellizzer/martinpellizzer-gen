    "intro": "Bromus procerus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are often tightly clustered. Bromus procerus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
