    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf bougainvillea, is a compact, flowering shrub native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant clusters of papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has small, inconspicuous true flowers that are surrounded by the colorful bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for container gardening and ornamental landscapes. Its compact size and showy blooms make it a versatile plant for both indoor and outdoor settings."
