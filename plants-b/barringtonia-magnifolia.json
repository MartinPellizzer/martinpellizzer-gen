    "intro": "Barringtonia magnifolia, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces a fruit that is typically covered in a thick, spiny rind, which contains a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall. The botanical features of Barringtonia magnifolia make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
