    "intro": "Bdallophytum, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. Bdallophytum species are generally herbaceous, with some species growing as annuals or perennials. Their botanical features make them well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand temperature extremes."
