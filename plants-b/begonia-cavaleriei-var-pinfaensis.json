    "intro": "Begonia cavaleriei var. pinfaensis, commonly known as the Pinfang begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to China. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
