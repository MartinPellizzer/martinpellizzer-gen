    "intro": "Begonia reptans, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across surfaces such as soil or hanging baskets. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive yellow eye at the center. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped and has a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Begonia reptans thrives in partial shade and moist, well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
