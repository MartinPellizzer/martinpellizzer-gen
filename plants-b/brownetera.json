It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Brownetera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
