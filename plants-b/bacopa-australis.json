    "intro": "Bacopa australis, commonly known as the Australian water bead, is a small aquatic plant native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its tiny, rounded leaves that resemble beads, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water, often in ponds or slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms throughout the warmer months. Bacopa australis is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to help clarify water."
