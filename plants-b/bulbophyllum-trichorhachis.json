    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trichorhachis, commonly known as the hairy root orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy roots that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum trichorhachis is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
