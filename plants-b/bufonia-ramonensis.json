    "intro": "Bufonia ramonensis, commonly known as the Ramon's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bufonia ramonensis is considered a vulnerable species."
