It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually covered with fine, soft hairs, which are less pronounced in this subspecies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
