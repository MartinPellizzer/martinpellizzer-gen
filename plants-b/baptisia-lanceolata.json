    "intro": "Baptisia lanceolata, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its striking blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The plant features palmately divided, light green leaves that are lance-shaped, giving it its scientific name. Baptisia lanceolata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its seed pods, which resemble small horns, are a distinctive feature that persists through the winter."
