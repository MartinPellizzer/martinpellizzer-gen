It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, gray-green leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it resilient to drought. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
