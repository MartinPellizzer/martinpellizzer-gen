The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and ease of care."
