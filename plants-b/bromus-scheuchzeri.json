    "intro": "Bromus scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Scheuchzer's brome, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers are small, with pale green to brown hues. Bromus scheuchzeri is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
