    "intro": "Begonia liesneri, commonly known as the Schomburgk's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
