    "intro": "Berberis dealbata, commonly known as the white-flowered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compound leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its bark is thick and has a distinctive yellowish hue, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Berberis dealbata is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
