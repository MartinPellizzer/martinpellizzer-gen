    "intro": "Bakeria gentilis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Bakeria gentilis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered a weed in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
