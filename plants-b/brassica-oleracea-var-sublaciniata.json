    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. sublaciniata, commonly known as ornamental kale, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its colorful, cabbage-like leaves. It is typically grown for its ornamental value rather than for consumption, featuring vibrant shades of green, purple, and red. The plant has a compact growth habit with deeply lobed, crinkled leaves that add texture to garden landscapes. It thrives in cool climates and is often used in fall gardens for its visual appeal. This variety is a popular choice for both gardeners and florists due to its aesthetic qualities and hardiness."
