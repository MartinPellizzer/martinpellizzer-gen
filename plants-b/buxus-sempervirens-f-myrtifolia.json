    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens f. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage, with leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to the typical boxwood. The plant has a slow growth rate, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. Its leaves are dark green and emit a mild, pleasant fragrance when crushed. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
