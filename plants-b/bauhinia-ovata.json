    "intro": "Bauhinia ovata, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive papery, ovate leaves that turn red or purple before falling in autumn. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
