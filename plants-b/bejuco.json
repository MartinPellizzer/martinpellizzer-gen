    "intro": "Bejuco, commonly known as the morning glory, is a climbing plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive spiral-shaped tendrils that allow it to climb and twine around supports. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Bejuco is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are heart-shaped and its stems are covered in fine hairs."
