    "intro": "Banksia subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Banksia subpinnatifida is adapted to fire-prone environments and often regenerates from seed after bushfires. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native wildlife."
