    "intro": "Berberis woomungensis, commonly known as the Woomung barbed wire bush, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a subtropical climate."
