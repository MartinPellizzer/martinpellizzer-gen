    "intro": "Bouchea garipensis, commonly known as the Desert Bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Bouchea garipensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
