    "intro": "Bombax stolzii, commonly known as the African silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink or red. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed and shed seasonally, contributing to its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various animals. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in local communities."
