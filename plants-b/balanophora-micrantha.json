    "intro": "Balanophora micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white flowers with a delicate, orchid-like appearance, typically blooming during the rainy season. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and difficult to study in the wild."
