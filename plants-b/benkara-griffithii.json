    "intro": "Benkara griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. Benkara griffithii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
