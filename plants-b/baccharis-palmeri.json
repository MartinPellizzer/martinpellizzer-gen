    "intro": "Baccharis palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Baccharis palmeri plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
