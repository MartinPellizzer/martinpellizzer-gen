It features a short, cylindrical stem covered with spiny areoles and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring. The plant's leaves are reduced to spines, and its pads are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
