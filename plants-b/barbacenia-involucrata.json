    "intro": "Barbacenia involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Barbacenia involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
