    "intro": "Betula demetrii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall before falling off. Betula demetrii is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in mountainous regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
