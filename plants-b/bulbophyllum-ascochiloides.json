    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ascochiloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a unique, flattened pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. It is known for its specific habitat requirements, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
