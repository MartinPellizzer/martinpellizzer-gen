    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lophoglottis, commonly known as the \"Paddle Orchid,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive saddle-shaped lip. Its bulbs are modified stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
