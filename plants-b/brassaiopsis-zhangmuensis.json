    "intro": "Brassaiopsis zhangmuensis, commonly known as the Zhangmu bracken, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brassaiopsis zhangmuensis is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
