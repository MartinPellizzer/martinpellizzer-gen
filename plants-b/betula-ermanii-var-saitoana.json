    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. saitoana, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a silvery sheen, and it tends to peel in thin, papery layers. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates."
