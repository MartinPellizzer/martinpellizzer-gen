It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, often prickly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
