It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded forest undergrowth. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, usually during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. Brachystelma schultzei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
