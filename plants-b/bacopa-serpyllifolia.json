    "intro": "Bacopa serpyllifolia, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, with a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
