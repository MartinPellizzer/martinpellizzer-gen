    "intro": "Banksia idiogenes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southwestern Australia, where it typically grows in heathlands and woodlands. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and its distinctive cylindrical flower spike, which consists of numerous yellow to orange flowers. Banksia idiogenes is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for various pollinators."
