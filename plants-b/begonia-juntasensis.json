    "intro": "Begonia juntasensis, commonly known as the Juntasense Begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display vibrant patterns of red, green, and white. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
