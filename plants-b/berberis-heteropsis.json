It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces bright orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Berberis heteropsis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
