    "intro": "Bignonia sarmentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf bignonia, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that often have a silvery or white underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive red or purple throat. These flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Bignonia sarmentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
