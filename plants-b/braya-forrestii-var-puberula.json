    "intro": "Braya forrestii var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent braya, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, rounded leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant adaptations to extreme environments."
