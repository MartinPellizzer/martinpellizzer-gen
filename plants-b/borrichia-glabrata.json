    "intro": "Borrichia glabrata, commonly known as the coastal burr or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Borrichia glabrata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
