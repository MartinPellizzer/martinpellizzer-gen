    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leion, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a bold visual element to its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Bulbophyllum leion is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper light and watering conditions."
