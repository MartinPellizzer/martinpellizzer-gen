The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. Bulbostylis squarrosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
