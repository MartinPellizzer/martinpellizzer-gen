It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems, and they can range from broad and heart-shaped to narrow and lanceolate. Badiera heterophylla is well adapted to grow in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
