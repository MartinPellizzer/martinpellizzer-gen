    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oreogigas, commonly known as the mountain giant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant produces large, showy flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its bulb-like structures, known as pseudobulbs, store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
