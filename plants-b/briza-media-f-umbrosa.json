    "intro": "Briza media f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving feather reed grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching inflorescences that produce delicate, airy plumes, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety thrives in moist, shady environments, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, bluish-green hue that adds texture to the landscape. It is a low-maintenance plant that spreads slowly through rhizomes, forming dense clumps over time."
