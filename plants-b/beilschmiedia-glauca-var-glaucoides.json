    "intro": "Beilschmiedia glauca var. glaucoides, commonly known as the blue-leaf beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a waxy, bluish sheen, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries that are orange-red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to mid-elevation forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
