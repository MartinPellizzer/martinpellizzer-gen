    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cyrtopetalum, commonly known as the coral spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
