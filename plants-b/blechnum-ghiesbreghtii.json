    "intro": "Blechnum ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
