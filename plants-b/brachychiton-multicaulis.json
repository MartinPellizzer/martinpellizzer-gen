    "intro": "Brachychiton multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed flame tree, is a striking tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its multiple trunks and broad, palm-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, pale green coating. The plant produces large, showy red or orange flowers in clusters during the wet season, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Brachychiton multicaulis is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
