    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stipitatibulbum, commonly known as the Stipitate Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
