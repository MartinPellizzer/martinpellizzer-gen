    "intro": "Bromopsis ubsunurica, commonly known as the Ubsunur grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe regions. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
