    "intro": "Barringtonia edaphocarpa var. ladellii, commonly known as the Ladellii Banyan, is a variant of the Banyan tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a fleshy, orange-red fruit that contains a single seed, typical of the genus Barringtonia. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas due to its tolerance for saline soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
