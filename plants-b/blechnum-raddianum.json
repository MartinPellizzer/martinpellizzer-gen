    "intro": "Blechnum raddianum, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in various substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
