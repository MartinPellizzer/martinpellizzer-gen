    "intro": "Brocchinia rupestris, commonly known as the rock brocchia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Brocchinia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
