    "intro": "Blumella psilantha, commonly known as the slender blumella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Blumella psilantha is considered a species of conservation concern."
