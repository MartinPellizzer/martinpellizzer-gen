    "intro": "Bromus brachyphyllus, commonly known as the short-leaved brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stiff leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage grass in arid and semi-arid regions."
