    "intro": "Brachyotum cogniauxii, commonly known as the African snowball, is a strikingly ornamental shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of white, spherical flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, creating a dramatic visual impact. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and its stems are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and seasonal blooms, it is a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
