    "intro": "Boea birmanica, commonly known as the hanging basket plant or silver vine, is a trailing evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators. It is well-suited for hanging baskets or shelves due to its cascading growth habit. Boea birmanica is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and moderate watering."
