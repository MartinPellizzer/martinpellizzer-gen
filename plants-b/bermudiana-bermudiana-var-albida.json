    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered Bermuda grass, is a variant of the Bermuda grass species native to the Caribbean and southern United States. It is characterized by its pale to white inflorescences, which distinguish it from the typical green-flowered varieties. This plant is a perennial grass that thrives in warm climates and well-drained soils, often forming dense mats. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is widely used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
