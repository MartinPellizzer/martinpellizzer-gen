    "intro": "Bulbophyllum digoelense var. septemtrionale, commonly known as the Northern Digoel Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
