    "intro": "Begonia princeps var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf-flowered begonia, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
