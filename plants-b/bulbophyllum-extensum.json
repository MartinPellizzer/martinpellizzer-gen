    "intro": "Bulbophyllum extensum, commonly known as the extended lip orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated lip that extends beyond the rest of the flower. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers are small and often appear in clusters, with a variety of colors ranging from white to pink and yellow."
