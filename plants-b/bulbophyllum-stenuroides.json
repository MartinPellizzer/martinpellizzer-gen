    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stenuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This epiphytic orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth."
