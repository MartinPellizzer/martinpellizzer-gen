    "intro": "Baccharoides calvoana subsp. mokaensis, commonly known as the Moka endemic shrub, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Albertine Rift in eastern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds through dehiscence. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forest and woodland habitats."
