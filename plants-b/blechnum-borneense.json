    "intro": "Blechnum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland and hill forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short and thick, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in moist soil. The fronds are often adorned with small, rounded sori that are clustered along the margins of the leaflets."
