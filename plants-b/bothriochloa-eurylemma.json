    "intro": "Bothriochloa eurylemma, commonly known as the broad-lemma grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often pale green to brown in color. This grass is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional practices or as forage for livestock."
