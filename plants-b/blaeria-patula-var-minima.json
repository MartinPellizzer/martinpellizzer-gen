    "intro": "Blaeria patula var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf blaeria, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, drought-tolerant plant."
