    "intro": "Buhsea trinervia, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid environments by efficiently absorbing and retaining moisture. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Buhsea trinervia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
