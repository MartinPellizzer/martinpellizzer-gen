    "intro": "Brexia serrata, commonly known as the saw-toothed fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features feathery, compound leaves with serrated edges that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Brexia serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
