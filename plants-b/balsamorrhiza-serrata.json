    "intro": "Balsamorrhiza serrata, commonly known as the Sierra glacialweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and stems that bear clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. Balsamorrhiza serrata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
