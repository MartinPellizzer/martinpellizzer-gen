    "intro": "Begonia peltatosanguinea, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-purple, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
