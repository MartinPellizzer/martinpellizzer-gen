    "intro": "Banara serrata, commonly known as the serrated banara, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. Banara serrata is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in local medicine."
