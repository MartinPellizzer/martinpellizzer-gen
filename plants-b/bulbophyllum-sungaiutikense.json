    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sungaiutikense, commonly known as the Utik River Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments along riverbanks and forest floors. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
