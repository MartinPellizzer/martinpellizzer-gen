    "intro": "Bistorta major subsp. ensigera, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and clusters of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a component of high-altitude ecosystems."
