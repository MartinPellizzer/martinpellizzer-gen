    "intro": "Billbergia skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with vibrant orange-red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia skinneri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting floral display."
