    "intro": "Bossekia peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Bossekia peltata is typically found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
