    "intro": "Boerhavia agglutinans, commonly known as the sticky weed or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has succulent stems and leaves, adapted to survive in dry environments. Its seeds are coated in a sticky substance, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Boerhavia agglutinans is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
