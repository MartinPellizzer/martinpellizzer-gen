    "intro": "Bupleurum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or tundra environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnate, with finely divided leaflets that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates. Bupleurum arcticum is adapted to survive in low temperatures and has a deep root system to access nutrients and water in poor soil conditions."
