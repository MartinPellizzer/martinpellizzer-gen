    "intro": "Bletia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid climates. Bletia graminifolia is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids in its native habitat."
