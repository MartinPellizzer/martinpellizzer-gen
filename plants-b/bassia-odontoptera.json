    "intro": "Bassia odontoptera, commonly known as the toothed goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Its leaves are often lobed or toothed, giving it its common name, and it is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Bassia odontoptera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
