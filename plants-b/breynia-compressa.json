    "intro": "Breynia compressa, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Breynia compressa is also known for its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
