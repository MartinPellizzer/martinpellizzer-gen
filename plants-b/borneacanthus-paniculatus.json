It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its clustered inflorescences and small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Borneacanthus paniculatus plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small fauna."
