    "intro": "Brodiaea, commonly known as the grass lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). These plants are native to western North America, particularly California and the southwestern United States. Brodiaea species are herbaceous perennials that produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. The flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
