    "intro": "Boechera holboellii var. pendulocarpa, commonly known as the pendulous rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. The variety pendulocarpa is distinguished by its drooping inflorescences, which give it its common name."
