    "intro": "Boechera inyoensis, commonly known as the Inyo rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high desert regions of California and Nevada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. This perennial species typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Boechera inyoensis has small, pinnately divided leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid and high-altitude conditions."
