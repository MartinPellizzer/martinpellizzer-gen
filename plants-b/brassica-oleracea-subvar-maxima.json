    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. maxima, commonly known as the cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its dense, white curd formed by tightly clustered flower buds. It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 40\u201380 cm, with thick, fleshy stalks and large, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in cool climates and requires a long growing season to develop its characteristic head. It is cultivated for its edible inflorescence, which is harvested before the flowers open. The genetic diversity within this subspecies has led to the development of various cultivars with different colors and textures."
