    "intro": "Biscutella mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its seed pods are distinctive, splitting open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Biscutella mediterranea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local insect populations."
