    "intro": "Begonia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its stems are thick and can develop a reddish hue, especially in cooler temperatures. Begonia longipetiolata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil for optimal growth."
