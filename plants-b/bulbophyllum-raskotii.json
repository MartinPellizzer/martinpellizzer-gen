    "intro": "Bulbophyllum raskotii, commonly known as the Raskotii orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often arranged in clusters, with vividly colored petals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
