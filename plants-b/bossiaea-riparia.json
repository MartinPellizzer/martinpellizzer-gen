    "intro": "Bossiaea riparia, commonly known as the river bossiaea, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often wet habitat. Bossiaea riparia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
