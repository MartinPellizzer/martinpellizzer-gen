    "intro": "Brickellia dentata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Brickellia dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
