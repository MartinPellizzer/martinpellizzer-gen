    "intro": "Broussonetia papyrifera var. cucullata, commonly known as the Chinese paper mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is widely cultivated for its fibrous bark, which has been used in papermaking and as a source of fiber for textiles. This variety is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
