    "intro": "Balsamina tilo, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Balsamina tilo thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
