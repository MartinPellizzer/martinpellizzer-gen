    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. ramosum, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
