    "intro": "Bignonia anastomosans, commonly known as the crossvine, is a woody climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, orange-yellow floral bracts. The flowers are typically clustered in terminal racemes and are accompanied by small, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a strong, woody stem with a fibrous, corky layer beneath the bark, which aids in its climbing habit. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
