    "intro": "Brachystelma constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed stone orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with limited moisture. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive constriction near the base of the stem. It blooms during the winter months, and its flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as moths and flies. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
