    "intro": "Bidens pilosa subvar. discoidea, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of two, giving it its common name. Its seeds are equipped with tiny hooks, allowing them to attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive plant in some areas."
