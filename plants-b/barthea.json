    "intro": "Barthea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Barthea is known for its unique appearance and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
