    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. erosum, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a fern-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble small, folded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like formation on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
