    "intro": "Bromelia arubaiensis, commonly known as the Red-veined Bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage with distinctive red veins. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers, though less showy than its leaves, are typically orange or red and bloom in summer. Bromelia arubaiensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
