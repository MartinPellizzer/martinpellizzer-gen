The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
