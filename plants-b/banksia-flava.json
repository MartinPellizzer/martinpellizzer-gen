    "intro": "Banksia flava, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower spikes, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Banksia flava typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including honeyeaters and bees."
