It is characterized by its grayish-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Baccharis denticulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
