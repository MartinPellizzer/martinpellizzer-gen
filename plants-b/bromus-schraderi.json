    "intro": "Bromus schraderi, commonly known as Schrader's brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and summer, and it is adapted to survive in arid environments. Bromus schraderi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
