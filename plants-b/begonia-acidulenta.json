It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.
