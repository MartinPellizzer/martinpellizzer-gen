    "intro": "Borealluma munbyana, commonly known as the sandstone lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open woodlands or shrublands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in the dry climate. Borealluma munbyana is also noted for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a characteristic species of its ecosystem."
