    "intro": "Bulbophyllum filicaule f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with intricate, spurred petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
