    "intro": "Bulbophyllum drepananthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it is considered rare in the wild."
