    "intro": "Bacopa nobsiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Bacopa nobsiana is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
