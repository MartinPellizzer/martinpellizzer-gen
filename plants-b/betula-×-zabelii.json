    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 zabelii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and the white birch (Betula pendula). It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and papery, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula \u00d7 zabelii is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America, where it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its adaptability to a range of soil types and climates makes it a popular choice for landscaping."
