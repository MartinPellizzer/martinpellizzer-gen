    "intro": "Beatonia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered beatonia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Beatonia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
