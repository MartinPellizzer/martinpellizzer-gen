    "intro": "Bupleurum schistosum, commonly known as rock skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It typically grows in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often found in limestone or gravelly soils. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Bupleurum schistosum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
