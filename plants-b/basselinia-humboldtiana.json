    "intro": "Basselinia humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's bassel, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
