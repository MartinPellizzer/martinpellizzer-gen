    "intro": "Blechnum valdiviense, commonly known as the Valdivian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is not commonly observed in B. valdiviense."
