It features rosettes of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
