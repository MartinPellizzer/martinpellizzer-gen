    "intro": "Beta rapa, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a hardy biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring alternate, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces a thick, edible root that is often used in traditional dishes. Beta rapa is also a wild relative of the domesticated cabbage and has been used in plant breeding programs to improve crop resilience."
