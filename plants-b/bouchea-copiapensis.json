    "intro": "Bouchea copiapensis, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bouchea copiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh desert conditions."
