    "intro": "Botrychium lunarioides var. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. It features a fiddlehead-like structure that unfurls into a bipinnate frond with a distinct, often curved shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its oblique or slanted frond arrangement, setting it apart from other members of the Botrychium genus."
