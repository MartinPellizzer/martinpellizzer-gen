    "intro": "Bilabrella involuta, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. The plant features delicate, elongated fronds that curl tightly around a central stem, creating a compact, spiral structure. Its leaves are typically green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Bilabrella involuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unusual appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
