    "intro": "Begonia parvuliflora var. parvuliflora, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing habit. Its botanical appeal lies in its compact growth and vibrant floral display."
