    "intro": "Begonia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a reddish-brown hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
