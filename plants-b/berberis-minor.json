    "intro": "Berberis minor, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are glossy and dark green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or gravelly gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent winter interest."
