It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Bulbophyllum procerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
