    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dianthum, commonly known as the Dianthum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features a compact growth habit with clustered pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
