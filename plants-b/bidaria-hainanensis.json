It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Bidaria hainanensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
