    "intro": "Bellis sylvestris subsp. pappulosa, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically blooms in spring and early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it its common name."
