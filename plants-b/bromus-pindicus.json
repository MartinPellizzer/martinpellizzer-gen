    "intro": "Bromus pindicus, commonly known as the Pindus brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment. Bromus pindicus is also used in some ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
