    "intro": "Baccharis rotundifolia f. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, subcuneate leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, finely textured leaves. This species is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
