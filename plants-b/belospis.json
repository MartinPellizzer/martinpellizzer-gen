    "intro": "Belospis, commonly known as the \"saddle-back orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, saddle-shaped flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and Indonesia. Belospis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitats. Their flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
