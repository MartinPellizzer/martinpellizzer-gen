    "intro": "Buddleja albotomentosa, commonly known as the silver-haired buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
