    "intro": "Berberis tabiensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
