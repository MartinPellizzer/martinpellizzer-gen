    "intro": "Bromus megastachys, commonly known as the giant brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, spike-like inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, disturbed soils, and open woodlands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
