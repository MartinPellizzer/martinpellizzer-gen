It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that often exhibit a distinctive striped pattern on the culms. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This bamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
