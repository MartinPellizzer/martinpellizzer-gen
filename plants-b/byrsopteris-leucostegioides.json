    "intro": "Byrsopteris leucostegioides, commonly known as the white-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Its fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
