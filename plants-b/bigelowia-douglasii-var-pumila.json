    "intro": "Bigelowia douglasii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bigelowia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, often reddish stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland areas. This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature compared to the typical form of Bigelowia douglasii."
