    "intro": "Byblis, commonly known as the mistletoe orchid, is a genus of carnivorous plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, which are then digested to provide nutrients. Byblis species typically grow in wet, acidic environments, often near water sources. Their flowers are usually bright and showy, attracting pollinators with their vivid colors. The plants are relatively easy to care for in cultivation, making them popular among enthusiasts."
