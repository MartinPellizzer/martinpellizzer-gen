    "intro": "Bauhinia similis, commonly known as the small-leaved bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that resemble the shape of a fan. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, often appearing in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Bauhinia similis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
