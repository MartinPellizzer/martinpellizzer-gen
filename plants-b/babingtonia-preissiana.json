    "intro": "Babingtonia preissiana, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It blooms during the warmer months, usually between September and December. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to the nectar-rich blooms."
