    "intro": "Betula nakaiana, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
