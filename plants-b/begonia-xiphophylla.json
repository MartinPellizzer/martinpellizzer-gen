    "intro": "Begonia xiphophylla, commonly known as the sword leaf begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
