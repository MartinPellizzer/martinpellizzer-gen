    "intro": "Bistorta major subsp. plumosa, commonly known as the purple falsebush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that are often tinged with purple, and its basal leaves that are rhombic to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
