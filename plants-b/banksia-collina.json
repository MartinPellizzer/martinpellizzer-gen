    "intro": "Banksia collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia collina thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
