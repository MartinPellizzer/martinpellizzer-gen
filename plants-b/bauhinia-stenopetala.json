    "intro": "Bauhinia stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds. Bauhinia stenopetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
