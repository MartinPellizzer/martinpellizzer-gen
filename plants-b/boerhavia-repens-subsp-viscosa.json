    "intro": "Boerhavia repens subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky bluemink, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that gives the plant its sticky texture. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
