    "intro": "Bloomeria clevelandii, commonly known as the Cleveland's bloomera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, and its flowers are small, pinkish-white blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its ornamental appeal. Bloomeria clevelandii is an important species for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
