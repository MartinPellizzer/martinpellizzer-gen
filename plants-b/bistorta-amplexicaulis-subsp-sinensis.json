    "intro": "Bistorta amplexicaulis subsp. sinensis, commonly known as Chinese bistort, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces tall, cylindrical flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
