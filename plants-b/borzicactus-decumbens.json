    "intro": "Borzicactus decumbens, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that features cylindrical stems covered in white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
