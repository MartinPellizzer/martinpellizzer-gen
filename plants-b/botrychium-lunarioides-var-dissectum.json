    "intro": "Botrychium lunarioides var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
