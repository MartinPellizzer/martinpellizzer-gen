    "intro": "Berberis cornuta, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically valuable and a potential invasive species in some regions."
