    "intro": "Bulbophyllum geminum, commonly known as the twin-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its native humid environment. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or greenish, are often arranged in clusters and are notable for their intricate structure."
