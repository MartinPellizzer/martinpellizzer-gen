    "intro": "Bidens macrocarpa var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf beggarweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its ovate, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural areas."
