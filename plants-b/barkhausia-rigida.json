    "intro": "Barkhausia rigida, commonly known as the rigid barkhausia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Barkhausia rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
