    "intro": "Beriesa baselloides, commonly known as the dwarf beryllia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Beriesa baselloides is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
