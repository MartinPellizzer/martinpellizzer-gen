    "intro": "Bassia parkii, commonly known as silverleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive silvery underside that gives it its common name. Bassia parkii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
