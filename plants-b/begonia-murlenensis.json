    "intro": "Begonia murlenensis, commonly known as the Murlen begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northeastern India. It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring deep green, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
