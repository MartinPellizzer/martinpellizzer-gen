    "intro": "Berlinia ivorensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its deep root system makes it well adapted to dry conditions, and it plays an important role in soil stabilization and biodiversity in its native habitat."
