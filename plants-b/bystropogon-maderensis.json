It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate appearance, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a short, narrow spur. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
