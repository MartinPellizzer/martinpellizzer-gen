It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. Blechnum lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
