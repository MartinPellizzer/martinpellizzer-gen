    "intro": "Bupleurum glaucum, commonly known as blue bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of long, fibrous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Bupleurum glaucum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
