    "intro": "Begonia repanda, commonly known as the wrinkled begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that have a distinctive wrinkled texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by both its foliage and its delicate, showy blooms."
