    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. rustica, commonly known as the downy birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Betula pubescens var. rustica is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
