    "intro": "Bassia ventricosa, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often inflated, giving the plant a distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention. Bassia ventricosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments."
