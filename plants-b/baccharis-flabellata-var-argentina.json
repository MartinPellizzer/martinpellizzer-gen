It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves that are often arranged in a flat, fan-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
