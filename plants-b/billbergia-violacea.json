    "intro": "Billbergia violacea, commonly known as the violet billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, violet-colored bracts that surround its small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia violacea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
