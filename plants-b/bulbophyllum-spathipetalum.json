    "intro": "Bulbophyllum spathipetalum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor substrates. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, with intricate, showy petals and a distinctive lip. It requires high humidity, bright indirect light, and well-draining soil to thrive."
