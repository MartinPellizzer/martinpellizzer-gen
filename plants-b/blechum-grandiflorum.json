    "intro": "Blechum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered blechum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, white to pale blue flowers with prominent yellow stamens. Its botanical name reflects its large, showy floral display, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged environments."
