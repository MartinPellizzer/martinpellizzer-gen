    "intro": "Betula michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's birch, is a species of birch native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in mixed hardwood forests. The tree has smooth, white to gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
