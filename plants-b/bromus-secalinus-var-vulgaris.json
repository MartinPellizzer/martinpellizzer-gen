    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. vulgaris, commonly known as the annual bromegrass, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a prominent midrib, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Bromus secalinus var. vulgaris is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can become a weed."
