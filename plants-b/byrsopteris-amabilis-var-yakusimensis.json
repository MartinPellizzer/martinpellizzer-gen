    "intro": "Byrsopteris amabilis var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a rare fern species native to the Japanese island of Yakushima. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of ancient forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of its fronds. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
