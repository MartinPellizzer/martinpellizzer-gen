    "intro": "Betula abolinii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically oval or elliptical in shape. Betula abolinii is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures."
