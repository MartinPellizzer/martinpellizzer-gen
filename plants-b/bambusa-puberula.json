    "intro": "Bambusa puberula, commonly known as the velvet bamboo, is a species native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, slightly hairy surface on the culms, which gives it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as a clump-forming bamboo, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and dark green, while the inflorescences are compound and bear small, pale yellow flowers. Bambusa puberula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in landscaping and as a decorative plant in gardens."
