    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. monostachyon, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikes that are typically arranged in a single, elongated raceme. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid growth, it is widely used in plant biology research."
