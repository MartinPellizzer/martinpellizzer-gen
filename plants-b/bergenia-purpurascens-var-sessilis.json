    "intro": "Bergenia purpurascens var. sessilis, commonly known as the purple leaf bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green to purple-tinged leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-red flowers in early spring, which are borne on sturdy, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Bergenia purpurascens var. sessilis is valued for its ornamental foliage and hardiness in gardens with similar growing conditions."
