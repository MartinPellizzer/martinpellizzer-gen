    "intro": "Banksia oleifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a bluish or greyish hue, and are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Banksia oleifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
