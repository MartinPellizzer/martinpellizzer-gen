    "intro": "Bromus decumbens var. racemosus, commonly known as the racemose brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically arranged in racemose inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas."
