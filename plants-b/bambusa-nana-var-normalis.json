    "intro": "Bambusa nana var. normalis, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clumping bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that grow to a maximum height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, bushy form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its small size and ornamental appearance, it is often used in landscaping and as a container plant."
