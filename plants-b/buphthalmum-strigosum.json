    "intro": "Buphthalmum strigosum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's common name reflects the dense, woolly texture of its leaves."
