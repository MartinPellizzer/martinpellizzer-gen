It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Baxteria species are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their long-lasting blooms. They require well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
