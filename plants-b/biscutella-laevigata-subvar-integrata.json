    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subvar. integrata, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
