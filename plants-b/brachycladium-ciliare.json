It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy margins, which give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet with bracts that are often hairy and elongated. Brachycladium ciliare is typically found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
