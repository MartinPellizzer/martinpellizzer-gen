    "intro": "Blitum polymorphum var. humile, commonly known as dwarf bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils near streams and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months."
