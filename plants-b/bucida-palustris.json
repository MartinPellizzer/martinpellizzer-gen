    "intro": "Bucida palustris, commonly known as the swamp buccina, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in wet, saline environments such as tidal marshes and mangrove swamps. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in the spring. Bucida palustris is well adapted to saltwater conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
