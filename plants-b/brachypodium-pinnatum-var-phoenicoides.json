    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. phoenicoides, commonly known as the golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
