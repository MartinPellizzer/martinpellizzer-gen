    "intro": "Brasiliorchis marginata, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lanceolate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its natural habitat."
