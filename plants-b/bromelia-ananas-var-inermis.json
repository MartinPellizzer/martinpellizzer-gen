    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. inermis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears showy, brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
