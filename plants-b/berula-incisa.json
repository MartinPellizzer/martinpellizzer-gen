    "intro": "Berula incisa, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and serrated. Its flowers are small and white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Berula incisa is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
