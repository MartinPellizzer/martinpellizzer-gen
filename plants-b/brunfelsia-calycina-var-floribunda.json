    "intro": "Brunfelsia calycina var. floribunda, commonly known as the purple shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter to early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
