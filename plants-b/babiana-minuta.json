    "intro": "Babiana minuta, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with a short growth period following rainfall. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive dry seasons. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in fynbos vegetation."
