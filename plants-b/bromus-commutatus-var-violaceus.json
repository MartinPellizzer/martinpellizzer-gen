    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. violaceus, commonly known as the violet false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive violet-blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, roadsides, and gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in association with other grasses and forbs in dry, sunny habitats."
