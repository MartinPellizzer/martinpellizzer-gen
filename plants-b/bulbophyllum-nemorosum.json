    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nemorosum, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it store water, adapting it to its often humid and shaded forest habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
