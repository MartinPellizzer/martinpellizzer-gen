    "intro": "Baccharis cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
