    "intro": "Bauhinia lambiana, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven pointed lobes. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames, hence its common name. Bauhinia lambiana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
