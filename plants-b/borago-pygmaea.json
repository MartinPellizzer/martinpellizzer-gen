    "intro": "Borago pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bugloss, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or small containers. Its flowers bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Borago pygmaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
