    "intro": "Benstonea affinis, commonly known as the Benstonea fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores found on the underside of the fronds. Benstonea affinis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
