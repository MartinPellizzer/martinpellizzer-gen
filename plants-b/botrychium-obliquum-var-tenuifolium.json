    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that resemble a fern, though it is not a true fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like formation. Botrychium obliquum var. tenuifolium is often found in the northern hemisphere and is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats."
