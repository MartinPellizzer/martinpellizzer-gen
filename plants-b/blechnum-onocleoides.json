    "intro": "Blechnum onocleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
