    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, club-shaped rhizome and a single, large, lanceolate frond. The frond is typically divided into several segments, giving it a fern-like appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its frond, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in woodlands or along stream banks."
