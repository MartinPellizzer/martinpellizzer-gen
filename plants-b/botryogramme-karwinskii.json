    "intro": "Botryogramme karwinskii, commonly known as the Karwinski's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark or rock surfaces in temperate forest regions. Botryogramme karwinskii is noted for its slow growth and is considered a bioindicator species for air quality."
