    "intro": "Bilabrella confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in forested areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green, strap-like leaves and a single, delicate white flower that blooms in late summer. It is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its roots rather than soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Bilabrella confusa is considered an endangered species."
