    "intro": "Bolbitis foxii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and striking member of the fern family. It is characterized by its bright golden-green fronds that contrast beautifully with its dark, leathery stems. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
