    "intro": "Baileya multiradiata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. Its scientific name reflects its unique floral structure, with \"multiradiata\" referring to the many ray florets. Baileya multiradiata is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
