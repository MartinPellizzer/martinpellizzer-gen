    "intro": "Baukea maxima, commonly known as the giant baukea, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and clusters of vibrant purple or pink tubular flowers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to grow outside its native range."
