    "intro": "Blechnum patersonii var. normale, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery, and lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive white midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a range of soil types."
