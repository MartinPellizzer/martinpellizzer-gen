    "intro": "Biscutella divionensis, commonly known as the Divion Valley biscutella, is a small annual herb native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
