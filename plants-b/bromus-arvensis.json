    "intro": "Bromus arvensis, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can outcompete native vegetation."
