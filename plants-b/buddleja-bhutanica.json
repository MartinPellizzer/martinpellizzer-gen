    "intro": "Buddleja bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese buddleia, is a shrub native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Buddleja bhutanica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
