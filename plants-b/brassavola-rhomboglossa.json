    "intro": "Brassavola rhomboglossa, commonly known as the rhombic-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower spike with three to five flowers, each having a distinctive rhomboid lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Brassavola rhomboglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
