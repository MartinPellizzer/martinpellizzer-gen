    "intro": "Bromus firmior, commonly known as the rigid brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus firmior is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
