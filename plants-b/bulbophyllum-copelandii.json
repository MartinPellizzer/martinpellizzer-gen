    "intro": "Bulbophyllum copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable environment."
