    "intro": "Banksia marcescens, commonly known as the black banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dark, woody fruiting structures that remain on the plant for several years before disintegrating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. Banksia marcescens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is an important species in the local ecosystem."
