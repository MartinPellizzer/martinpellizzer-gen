    "intro": "Burretiokentia vieillardii, commonly known as the New Caledonia cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical research."
