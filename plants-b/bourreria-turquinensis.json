    "intro": "Bourreria turquinensis, commonly known as the Turquin's bourreria, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its small, yellowish-orange flowers. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, woody fruits called achenes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
