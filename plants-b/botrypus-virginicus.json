    "intro": "Botrypus virginicus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often submerged or floating on the surface of wetlands. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in loose, brush-like clusters along the leaf blades. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Sweet flag is often used in traditional medicine and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
