    "intro": "Betula davurica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a serrated margin. The bark of this variety is smooth and white, often developing a flaky texture as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
