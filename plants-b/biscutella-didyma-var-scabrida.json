It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
