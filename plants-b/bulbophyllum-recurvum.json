    "intro": "Bulbophyllum recurvum, commonly known as the curling lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that have a distinctive curling lip shape, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal rainfall."
