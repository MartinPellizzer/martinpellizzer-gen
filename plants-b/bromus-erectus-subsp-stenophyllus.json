It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and drought tolerance."
