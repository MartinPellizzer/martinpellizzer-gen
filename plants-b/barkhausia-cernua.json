It is characterized by its pendulous, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant's bark is distinctive, featuring a rough, fissured texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
