    "intro": "Bauhinia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bauhinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. Bauhinia hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
