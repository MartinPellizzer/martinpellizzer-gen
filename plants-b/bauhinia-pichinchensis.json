    "intro": "Bauhinia pichinchensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble hands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its seed pods are flat and contain several seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Bauhinia pichinchensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
