    "intro": "Botrypus yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette-like structure on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrypus yunnanensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
