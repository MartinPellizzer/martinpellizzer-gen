    "intro": "Blechnum vulcanicum var. rapense, commonly known as the Vulcan fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
