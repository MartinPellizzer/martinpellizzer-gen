    "intro": "Billbergia jandebrabanderi, commonly known as the Jandebrabander's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathiform inflorescence that displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous covering, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
