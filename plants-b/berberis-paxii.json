    "intro": "Berberis paxii, commonly known as the Corsican barberry, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and dense, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its leaves and stems contain berberine, a compound with medicinal properties. Berberis paxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
