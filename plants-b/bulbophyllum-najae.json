    "intro": "Bulbophyllum najae, commonly known as the Red-Bellied Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant features a rhizome with numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of red and orange, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
