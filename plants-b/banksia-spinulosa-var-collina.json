    "intro": "Banksia spinulosa var. collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in winter and spring. The plant produces large, woody cones that persist on the plant for many years, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
