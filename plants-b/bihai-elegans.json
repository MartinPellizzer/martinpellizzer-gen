    "intro": "Bihai elegans, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with five petals and a prominent central stigma. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bihai elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
