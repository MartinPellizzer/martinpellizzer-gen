    "intro": "Buchnera arenicola, commonly known as the sand bur, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, wind-dispersed fruits. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small insects. Buchnera arenicola is often found in regions with hot, dry climates."
