    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp. cymosus, commonly known as sea club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to form dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
