    "intro": "Bignonia decora, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb structures make it both useful and potentially invasive if not managed properly."
