    "intro": "Bunochilus montanus, commonly known as the mountain bunochilus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bunochilus montanus is considered a vulnerable species."
