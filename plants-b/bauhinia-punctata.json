    "intro": "Bauhinia punctata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves and pods are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Bauhinia punctata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
