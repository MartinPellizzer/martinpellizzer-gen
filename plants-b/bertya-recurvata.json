    "intro": "Bertya recurvata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bertya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Bertya recurvata is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
