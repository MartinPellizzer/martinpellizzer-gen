    "intro": "Biarum tenuifolium var. zelebori, commonly known as the Zelbori bellflower, is a rare and unique variant of the Biarum genus. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Native to specific regions in South Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
