    "intro": "Bromus aveniformis, commonly known as the wheatgrass bromus, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear a dense cluster of spikelets at the apex. The plant typically produces small, greenish to brownish flowers, which are arranged in panicles. Bromus aveniformis is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a variety of soil types. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
