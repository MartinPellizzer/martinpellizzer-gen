    "intro": "Begonia minor, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and modest flowering, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor gardens."
