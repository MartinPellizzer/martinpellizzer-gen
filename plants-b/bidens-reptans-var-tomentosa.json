    "intro": "Bidens reptans var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing botanical feature."
