It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability. The plant also has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
