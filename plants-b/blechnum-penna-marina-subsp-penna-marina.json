    "intro": "Blechnum penna-marina subsp. penna-marina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a feather, with a silvery sheen on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and forests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a feature that aids in its identification and ecological interactions."
