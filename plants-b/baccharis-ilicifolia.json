    "intro": "Baccharis ilicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Baccharis ilicifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
