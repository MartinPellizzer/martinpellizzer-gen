    "intro": "Bromus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu brome, is a grass species endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of the mountain's ecosystem. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the region."
