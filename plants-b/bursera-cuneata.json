    "intro": "Bursera cuneata, commonly known as the Mexican birch, is a small, evergreen tree or shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that resembles the bark of birch trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Bursera cuneata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions."
