    "intro": "Buxus hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Buxus hebecarpa is often cultivated as a hedging plant or topiary due to its ability to maintain a neat shape. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
