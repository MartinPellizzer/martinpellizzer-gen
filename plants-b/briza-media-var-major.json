    "intro": "Briza media var. major, commonly known as the tall quaking grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that sway in the wind, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces feathery, golden-brown seed heads that are prominent in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden settings and ecological restoration projects."
