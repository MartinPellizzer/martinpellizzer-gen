    "intro": "Buxus pubifolia, commonly known as the hairy boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue, oval berries. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens due to its ability to be shaped into various forms. Buxus pubifolia prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a range of garden environments."
