    "intro": "Broughtonia ortgiesiana, commonly known as the Ortgies' bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Broughtonia ortgiesiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
