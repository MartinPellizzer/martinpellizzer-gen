    "intro": "Bergeretia, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plants typically have a short, thick rhizome with a rosette of waxy, leathery leaves that form a tight cluster. Bergeretia species produce an inflorescence called a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. These plants are often grown as ornamental plants due to their unique foliage and striking floral structures."
