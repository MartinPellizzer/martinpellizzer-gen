    "intro": "Brunfelsia brasiliensis subsp. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a strong fragrance. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, and the plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
