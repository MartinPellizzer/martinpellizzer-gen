    "intro": "Boehmeria humilis, commonly known as silky fiber plant or Chinese grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its slender, fibrous stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to produce long, fine fibers that have been historically used in textile production. Its growth habit is often creeping or prostrate, making it suitable for ground cover in moist, shaded environments. Boehmeria humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
