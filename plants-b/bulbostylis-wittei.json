It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, sandy soils near water bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
