    "intro": "Bromopsis pannonica subsp. monoclada, commonly known as the Pannonian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
