    "intro": "Bromus rigidus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender rigid brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the tip of each culm, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
