    "intro": "Buxus latistyla, commonly known as the broad-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are broader than those of typical boxwoods. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for topiary and hedging."
