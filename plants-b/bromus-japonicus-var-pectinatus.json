    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. pectinatus, commonly known as Japanese brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color, and the inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
