    "intro": "Blatti, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-green leaves and small, violet flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Blatti is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
