    "intro": "Begonia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features sprawling, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across surfaces such as soil or rocks. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and the leaves often have a metallic sheen. Begonia prostrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a ground cover or hanging plant in gardens."
