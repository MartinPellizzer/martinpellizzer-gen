    "intro": "Betula longilobata, commonly known as the mountain paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Betula longilobata plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
