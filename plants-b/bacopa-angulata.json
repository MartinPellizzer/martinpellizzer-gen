    "intro": "Bacopa angulata, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas in the Americas. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often lance-shaped. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bacopa angulata is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported cognitive and calming effects."
