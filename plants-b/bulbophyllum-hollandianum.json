    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hollandianum, commonly known as the Hollandian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in drier conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in various colors, typically white or pink, during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
