    "intro": "Biggina \u00d7 conifera, commonly known as the hybrid mangrove, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Biggina alba and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. It is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and tidal environments, often found in coastal areas. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a robust root system and salt-excreting leaves. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological adaptability and potential for restoration projects in degraded coastal ecosystems."
