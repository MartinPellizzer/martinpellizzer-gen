    "intro": "Bromus giganteus var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides. It produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, and its flowering period occurs in the spring to early summer. This grass is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
