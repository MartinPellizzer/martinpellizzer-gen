    "intro": "Boswellia dioscoridis, commonly known as frankincense or olibanum, is a species of flowering plant in the Burseraceae family. It is native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Horn of Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The tree produces a resinous sap that is harvested and used in incense, perfumes, and traditional medicine. The botanical features include its small, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The resin, known as frankincense, is collected by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to exude and harden into droplets."
