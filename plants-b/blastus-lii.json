    "intro": "Blastus lii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive central white star-shaped structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Blastus lii is now considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
