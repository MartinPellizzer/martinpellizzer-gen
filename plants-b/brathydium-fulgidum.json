    "intro": "Brathydium fulgidum, commonly known as the golden cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a bright yellow to orange thallus with a distinctive, cup-like shape. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on decaying wood or bark in temperate forests. Due to its unique color and structure, it is a notable species in ecological studies and lichenology."
