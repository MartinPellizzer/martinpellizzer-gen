    "intro": "Begonia incana var. auriformis, commonly known as the auriform begonia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, silver-green leaves that are often adorned with intricate, auricle-like lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its unique foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
