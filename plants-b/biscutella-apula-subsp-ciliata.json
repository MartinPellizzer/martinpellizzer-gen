    "intro": "Biscutella apula subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the Sicilian biscuit vetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves with finely ciliate margins. This plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a distinctive, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
