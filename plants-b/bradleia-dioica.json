    "intro": "Bradleia dioica, commonly known as the slender bradleia, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Bradleia dioica is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
