    "intro": "Brayopsis calycina var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender brayopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including small spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
