    "intro": "Banara exechandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Banara exechandra is now listed as an endangered species."
