It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil or rocky surfaces. Brassaiopsis malayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
