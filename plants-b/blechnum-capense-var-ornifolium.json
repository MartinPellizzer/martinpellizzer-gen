    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. ornifolium, commonly known as the ornate maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Blechnum capense species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided, and often ornate fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
