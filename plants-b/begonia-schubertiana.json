    "intro": "Begonia schubertiana, commonly known as the Schubert's begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep red to dark purple. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia schubertiana is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
