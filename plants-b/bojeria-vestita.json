    "intro": "Bojeria vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Bojeria vestita thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or forest understory habitats. Its hairy foliage provides a unique texture and contributes to its ecological role in supporting insect life."
