It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate and delicate leaf structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, release spores that contribute to its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bryobium moultonii is of interest to botanists studying rare plant species."
