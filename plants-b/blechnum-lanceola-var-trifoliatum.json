    "intro": "Blechnum lanceola var. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the blechnum fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The leaves are evergreen and can remain viable for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
