    "intro": "Brachystegia tamarindoides subsp. tamarindoides, commonly known as the tamarind tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and valuable timber, it is an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
