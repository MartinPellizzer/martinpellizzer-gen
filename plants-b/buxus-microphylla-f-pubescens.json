    "intro": "Buxus microphylla f. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly box or hairy box, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it ideal for shaping and maintaining in garden landscapes."
