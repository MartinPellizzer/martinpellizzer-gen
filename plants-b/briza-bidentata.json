    "intro": "Briza bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Briza bidentata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
