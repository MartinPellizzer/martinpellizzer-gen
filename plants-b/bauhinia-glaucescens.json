    "intro": "Bauhinia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often blue-green in color, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia glaucescens is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
