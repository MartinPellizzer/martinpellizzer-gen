    "intro": "Bunias erucago var. ambigua, commonly known as the wild radish, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into long, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
