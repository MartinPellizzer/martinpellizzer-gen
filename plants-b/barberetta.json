    "intro": "Barberetta, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments. Barberetta is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to spread through runners."
