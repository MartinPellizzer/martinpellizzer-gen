    "intro": "Barringtonia pauciflora, commonly known as the little cabbage tree, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are large, palmate, and have a waxy surface, contributing to its unique appearance."
