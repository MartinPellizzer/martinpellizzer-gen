    "intro": "Bitteria, commonly known as bitterleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and yellow or green flowers. Bitteria species are often cultivated for their edible leaves, which are used in traditional cuisines, though they can be quite bitter when raw. The fruits of some Bitteria species are also edible and may be used in local remedies. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of both agricultural and medicinal practices in its native habitats."
