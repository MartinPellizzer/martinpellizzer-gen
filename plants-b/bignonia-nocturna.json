It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Bignonia nocturna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
