    "intro": "Bellevalia pseudofominii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
