    "intro": "Bakerisideroxylon bruneelii, commonly known as the Buru ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant belongs to the family Burseraceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several centuries in age. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
