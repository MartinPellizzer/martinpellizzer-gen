    "intro": "Brachypodium \u00d7 cugnacii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a sterile, diploid hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Brachypodium distachyon and Brachypodium stamineum. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grass-like foliage, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its genome is of interest to researchers studying grass genetics and plant evolution. However, it does not produce viable seeds, limiting its role in natural propagation."
