    "intro": "Bertholletia minor, commonly known as the small Brazil nut tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is closely related to the well-known Brazil nut tree, Bertholletia excelsa. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
