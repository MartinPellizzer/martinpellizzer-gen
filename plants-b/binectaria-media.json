    "intro": "Binectaria media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nettle, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can become somewhat woody at the base. Binectaria media is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
