    "intro": "Begonia tuberosa, commonly known as the wax begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce trailing stems, suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
