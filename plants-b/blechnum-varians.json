It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and woodland landscapes."
