    "intro": "Bryonia cordatifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow, cucumber-like fruits that are typically toxic but have been historically used in traditional medicine. Its stems are hairy and often trailing or climbing, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Bryonia cordatifolia is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and its role in the genus Bryonia, which includes several species with similar morphological features."
