    "intro": "Buglossoides arvensis subsp. sibthorpiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and wastelands, and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, branching stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in loose spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
