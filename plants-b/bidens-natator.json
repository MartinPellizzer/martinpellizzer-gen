    "intro": "Bidens natator, commonly known as the floating needle. This aquatic plant is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that float on the surface of water. It produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets that resemble daisies. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rapid growth makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic environments."
