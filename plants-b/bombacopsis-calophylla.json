    "intro": "Bombacopsis calophylla, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions. The silky gum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
