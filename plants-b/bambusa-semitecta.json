    "intro": "Bambusa semitecta, commonly known as the golden bamboo or yellow bamboo, is a species of grass in the family Poaceae. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with its dark green leaves. This bamboo grows in clusters and can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread rapidly in suitable environments. Bambusa semitecta is also valued for its use in construction and as a decorative plant in gardens and parks."
