    "intro": "Bromus erectus subsp. caprearum, commonly known as the creeping brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
