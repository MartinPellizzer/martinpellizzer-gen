    "intro": "Bidens fecunda, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens fecunda is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
