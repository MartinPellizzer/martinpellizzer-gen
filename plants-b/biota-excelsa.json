It is characterized by its enormous, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant has a unique structure with a thick, spongy stem that supports its massive leaves and helps it stay afloat. Its flowers are large and showy, typically white or pink, and bloom at night. Biota excelsa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
