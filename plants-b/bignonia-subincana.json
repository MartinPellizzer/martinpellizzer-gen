    "intro": "Bignonia subincana, commonly known as the silverleaf bignonia, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, spurred shape. The plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its showy blooms and vigorous growth. Bignonia subincana is also known for its ability to climb and twine around supports, making it a popular choice for trellises and fences."
