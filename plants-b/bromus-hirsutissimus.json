    "intro": "Bromus hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other grasses. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are covered in soft, hairy bracts. Bromus hirsutissimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
