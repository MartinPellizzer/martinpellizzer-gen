    "intro": "Berberis hobsonii, commonly known as the Hobson\u2019s barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
