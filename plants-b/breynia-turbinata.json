    "intro": "Breynia turbinata, commonly known as the Turban Breynia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Breynia turbinata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
