    "intro": "Baptisia hugeri, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Baptisia hugeri thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
