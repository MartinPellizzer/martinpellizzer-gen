    "intro": "Bulbostylis contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
