    "intro": "Buxus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as a topiary plant due to its ability to be shaped into various forms. Buxus chinensis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping in temperate climates."
