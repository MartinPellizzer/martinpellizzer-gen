It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow, cross-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, slender pods containing numerous seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in various parts of the world. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can become a weed."
