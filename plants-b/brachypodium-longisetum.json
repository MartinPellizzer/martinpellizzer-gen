    "intro": "Brachypodium longisetum, commonly known as the long-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted shoots and dense, fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, particularly along the edges, giving it its common name. Brachypodium longisetum is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
