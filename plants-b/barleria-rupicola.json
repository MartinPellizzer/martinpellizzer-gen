    "intro": "Barleria rupicola, commonly known as rock barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Barleria rupicola is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
