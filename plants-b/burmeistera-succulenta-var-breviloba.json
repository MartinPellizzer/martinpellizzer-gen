It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its slow growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
