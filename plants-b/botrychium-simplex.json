    "intro": "Botrychium simplex, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, small, and delicate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like shape on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium simplex is a rare and ancient species, with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era."
