    "intro": "Boehmeria zollingeriana var. zollingeriana, commonly known as the giant bamboo or giant arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, fibrous rhizomes and tall, slender stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin, often with a waxy coating. This species is valued for its fibrous stalks, which are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber for textiles and paper."
