    "intro": "Bulbophyllum insectiferum, commonly known as the insect-carrying orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. Its unique name is derived from the way its flowers can attract and carry small insects. Bulbophyllum insectiferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
