    "intro": "Biasolettia parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian biasolettia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
