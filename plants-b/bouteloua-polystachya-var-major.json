    "intro": "Bouteloua polystachya var. major, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of fluffy, silver-green seeds that resemble sea oats. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils, often in prairie or coastal dune environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in xerophytic landscapes. Its feathery inflorescence adds ornamental value, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in sandy areas."
