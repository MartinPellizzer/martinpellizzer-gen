    "intro": "Baccharis triptera, commonly known as wax myrtle or southern wax myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fragrant oils. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its fruits are small, dry drupes that contain a single seed, aiding in its propagation. Baccharis triptera thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in wetland areas, coastal regions, and disturbed sites."
