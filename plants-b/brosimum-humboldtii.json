    "intro": "Brosimum humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its light, porous wood that is remarkably buoyant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
