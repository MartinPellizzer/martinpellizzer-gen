    "intro": "Blastus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean blastus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. Blastus borneensis is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to the humid, warm climate of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the biodiversity of Borneo."
