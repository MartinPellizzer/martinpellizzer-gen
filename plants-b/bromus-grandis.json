    "intro": "Bromus grandis, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Its inflorescence is often branched, with the spikelets oriented downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. Bromus grandis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed sites."
