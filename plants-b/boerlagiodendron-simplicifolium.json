    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved boerlagiodendron, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
