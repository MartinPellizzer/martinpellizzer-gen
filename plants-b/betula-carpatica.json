    "intro": "Betula carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian birch, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that becomes more pronounced with age, and its slender, graceful form. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Betula carpatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
