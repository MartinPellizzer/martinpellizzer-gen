    "intro": "Banksia filiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a distinctive Australian shrub or small tree belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is native to the south-western region of Western Australia, where it typically grows in sandy soils and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its unique, cylindrical inflorescence that produces yellow to orange flowers. These flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance. After flowering, the plant develops woody follicles that release seeds, aiding in its propagation and adaptation to its environment."
