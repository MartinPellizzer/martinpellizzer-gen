    "intro": "Bulbine setifera, commonly known as the needle-flower bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, spiky yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
