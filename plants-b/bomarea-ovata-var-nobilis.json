    "intro": "Bomarea ovata var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble bomarea, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
