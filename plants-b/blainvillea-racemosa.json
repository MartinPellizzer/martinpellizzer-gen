    "intro": "Blainvillea racemosa, commonly known as the yellow passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that resemble those of the passionfruit. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a sweet scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, orange-red berry that ripens in late summer. Blainvillea racemosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates."
