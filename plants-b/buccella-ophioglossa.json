    "intro": "Buccella ophioglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It has a unique morphology characterized by a fleshy, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the end of a slender stalk. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are highly specialized for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with other rare plant species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
