    "intro": "Bromelia cruenta, commonly known as the blood bromeliad, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Bromelia cruenta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid environments."
