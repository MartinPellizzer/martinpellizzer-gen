    "intro": "Brachyotum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine brachyotum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
