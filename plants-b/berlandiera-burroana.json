    "intro": "Berlandiera burroana, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Berlandiera burroana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting desert wildlife."
