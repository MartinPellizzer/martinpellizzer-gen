    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra var. pomacea, commonly known as the pink princess bougainvillea, is a vibrant flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense clusters of papery bracts that range in color from pink to magenta, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers inside the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a potted plant."
