    "intro": "Bulbine spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge bulb, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to its resilience in dry conditions. Bulbine spongiosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental value."
