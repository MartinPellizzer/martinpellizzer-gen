    "intro": "Boerhavia diffusa var. xerophila, commonly known as sandmat or red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing, annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, featuring a deep root system and thick leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The leaves and stems are harvested for use in herbal remedies and as a source of food in some regions."
