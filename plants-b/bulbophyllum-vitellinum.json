    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vitellinum, commonly known as the yellow bulbophyllum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum vitellinum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
