It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its hairy leaves and inflorescence, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. This form is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain ecosystems."
