    "intro": "Begonia peltatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often brightly colored and textured. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
