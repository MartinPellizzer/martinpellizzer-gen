    "intro": "Bidens tripartita var. pumila, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features small, yellow flowers with five petals and produces seeds with fine, silky hairs that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
