    "intro": "Boswellia bhaw-dajiana var. serrulata, commonly known as frankincense tree, is a species of the genus Boswellia native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is harvested from its bark and used in incense, medicine, and traditional rituals. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a serrated edge, giving it the variety name *serrulata*. The tree can live for centuries, making it a valuable and long-lived species in its native ecosystems."
