    "intro": "Baeothryon mattfeldianum, commonly known as the Mattfeld's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates. This lichen is of particular interest in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
