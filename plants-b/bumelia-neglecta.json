    "intro": "Bumelia neglecta, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Bumelia neglecta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
