    "intro": "Blechnum scabrum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its fronds are usually leathery and dark green, with a rough, scaly texture on the underside. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, shaded environments."
