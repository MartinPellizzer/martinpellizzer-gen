    "intro": "Betula alba var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a variant of the white birch native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or greenish inner layer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and they turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in mountainous or forested regions. This species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological systems of boreal and subarctic environments."
