    "intro": "Blechnum punctulatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate harts-tongue fern, is a variant of the harts-tongue fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its fronds are usually divided into smaller, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
