    "intro": "Besleria formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique ability to host ants in specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for the colony. The plant's leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink. The relationship between the plant and its ant inhabitants is mutualistic, with the ants protecting the plant from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food."
