    "intro": "Bromus porteri, commonly known as the Porteri brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each containing a single floret. Bromus porteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
