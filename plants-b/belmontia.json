    "intro": "Belmontia, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically have five petals and a prominent central disk. Belmontia species are often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Their flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
