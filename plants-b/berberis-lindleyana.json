    "intro": "Berberis lindleyana, commonly known as the Lindley barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of southern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are dark green and glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest. The shrub is also notable for its thorny stems, which provide a natural defense against herbivores."
