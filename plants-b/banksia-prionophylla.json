It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that contain the plant's characteristic yellow flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is adapted to fire-prone environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The species plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
