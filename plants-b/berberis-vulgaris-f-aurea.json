    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris f. aurea, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage. Its leaves are narrowly elliptical, with a striking golden-yellow coloration that stands out against the green of other varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the common barberry, known for its vibrant, year-round color."
