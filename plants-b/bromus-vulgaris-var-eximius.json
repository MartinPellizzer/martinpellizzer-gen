    "intro": "Bromus vulgaris var. eximius, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in agricultural areas and can be a common weed in cultivated fields."
