    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longiserpens, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, serpentine-shaped pseudobulbs, which are covered in a dense layer of brownish, fibrous roots. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns resembling snake scales. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
