It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature.
