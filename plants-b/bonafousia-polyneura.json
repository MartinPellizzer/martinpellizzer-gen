    "intro": "Bonafousia polyneura, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
