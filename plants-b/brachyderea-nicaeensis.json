    "intro": "Brachyderea nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean brachyderea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brachyderea nicaeensis is considered a vulnerable species."
