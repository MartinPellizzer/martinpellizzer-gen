    "intro": "Bergia serrata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to rocky or sandy shores. Bergia serrata thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important part of coastal vegetation."
