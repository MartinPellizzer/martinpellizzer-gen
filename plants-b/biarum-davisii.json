    "intro": "Biarum davisii, commonly known as the Davis's bellflower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Biarum davisii is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
