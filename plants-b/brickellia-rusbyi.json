    "intro": "Brickellia rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Brickellia rusbyi is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to native pollinators."
