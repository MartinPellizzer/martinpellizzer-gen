    "intro": "Banksia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody cone-like inflorescences that produce yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are broad, leathery, and resemble oak leaves, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant is well adapted to fire, with serotinous cones that release seeds after a bushfire."
