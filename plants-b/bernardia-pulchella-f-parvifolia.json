    "intro": "Bernardia pulchella f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Bernardia, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained, sunny conditions."
