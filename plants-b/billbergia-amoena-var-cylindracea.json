    "intro": "Billbergia amoena var. cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, bluish-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in summer. Its foliage is often marked with white or yellow stripes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
