    "intro": "Bignonia cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a woody vine that produces striking yellow-orange tubular flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems, a characteristic known as cauliflory. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical forests. Its flowers attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, contributing to its ecological importance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, adding to its ornamental value."
