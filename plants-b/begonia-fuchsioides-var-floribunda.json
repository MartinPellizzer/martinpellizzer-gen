    "intro": "Begonia fuchsioides var. floribunda, commonly known as the floribunda begonia, is a hybrid plant prized for its vibrant, showy flowers. It features upright stems that bear clusters of tubular, fuchsia or pink blossoms, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. The leaves are heart-shaped with a glossy, dark green surface and often have a velvety texture. This variety thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for container gardening or as a bedding plant. Its ornamental value lies in its prolonged flowering period and ability to add color to gardens throughout the growing season."
