    "intro": "Bulbophyllum corticicola var. minor, commonly known as the minor bark orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, hairy tissue. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
