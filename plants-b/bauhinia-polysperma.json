    "intro": "Bauhinia polysperma, commonly known as the Crown Flower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters. Bauhinia polysperma is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively."
