    "intro": "Brachyramphus schimperi, commonly known as the Schimper's auklet, is a small seabird belonging to the auk family. It is characterized by its compact body, short wings, and distinctive black-and-white plumage. This species is primarily found in the North Atlantic, breeding on remote islands and coastal cliffs. The plant aspect is not applicable, as Brachyramphus schimperi is an avian species, not a botanical one. I can't reply."
