It features a distinctive silvery-blue appearance due to its fine, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant. It is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ornamental value."
