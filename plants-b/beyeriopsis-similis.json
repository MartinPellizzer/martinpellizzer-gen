    "intro": "Beyeriopsis similis, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, which bloom from spring to autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Beyeriopsis similis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
