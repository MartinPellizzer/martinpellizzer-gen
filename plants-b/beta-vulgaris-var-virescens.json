    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. virescens, commonly known as the leaf beet or\u8399\u83dc, is a cultivated variant of the beet plant characterized by its leafy foliage rather than its root. It is native to Europe and has been historically grown for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often used in salads or cooked dishes. Its botanical features include a short, thickened stem and a rosette-like growth pattern, making it well-suited for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
