    "intro": "Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea beet, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, edible seeds. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils near the shoreline. Sea beet is often found in tidal zones and is valued for its salt tolerance and ornamental qualities."
