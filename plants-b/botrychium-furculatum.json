    "intro": "Botrychium furculatum, commonly known as the forked spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, forked fronds that resemble a bird's foot, with a central stalk and two lateral branches. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium furculatum is a non-vascular plant that relies on spores for reproduction rather than seeds."
