    "intro": "Betula alba lusus asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliate white birch, is a rare variant of the white birch tree characterized by its unique leaf morphology. This plant exhibits serrated, finely toothed leaves that resemble the shape of the fern genus Asplenium, giving it its common name. It is typically found in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions of Europe. The bark of Betula alba lusus asplenifolia is smooth and white, similar to its parent species, but it tends to develop fissures as the tree matures. Due to its rarity and distinct appearance, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
