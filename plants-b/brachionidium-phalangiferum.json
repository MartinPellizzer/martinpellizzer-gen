    "intro": "Brachionidium phalangiferum, commonly known as the long-tailed brachionid, is a species of rotifer found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the phylum Rotifera and is characterized by its elongated, thread-like body and a distinctive tail-like structure. The organism possesses a crown of cilia, which it uses for locomotion and feeding. It is typically found in ponds, lakes, and other still water habitats. Due to its small size, it plays a significant role in aquatic food webs as a primary consumer."
