    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. hispidum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
