    "intro": "Bulbostylis hispidula subsp. filiformis, commonly known as the slender bulbostylis, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
