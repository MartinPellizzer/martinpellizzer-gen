    "intro": "Briza macrostachya, commonly known as quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, arching stems and feathery, silver-green foliage that shimmers in the wind. The plant produces fluffy, bottlebrush-like seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Briza macrostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for small insects and birds."
