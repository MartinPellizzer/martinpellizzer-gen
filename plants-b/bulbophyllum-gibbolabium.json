    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gibbolabium, commonly known as the broad-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a broad, flat lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged in a spike, often with a strong, spicy fragrance. Bulbophyllum gibbolabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
