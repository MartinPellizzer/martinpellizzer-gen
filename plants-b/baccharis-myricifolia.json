    "intro": "Baccharis myricifolia, commonly known as waxleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage that is covered in a fine layer of wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
