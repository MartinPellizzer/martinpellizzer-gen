    "intro": "Boronia crenulata subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boronia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
