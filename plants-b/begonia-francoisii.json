    "intro": "Begonia francoisii, commonly known as the Francois' begonia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of bright red tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest canopies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and the flowers bloom during the rainy season. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
