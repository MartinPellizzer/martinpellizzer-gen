    "intro": "Barringtonia serrata, commonly known as the mangosteen tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are alternate and serrated. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, followed by edible, bright red fruits with a segmented, white, juicy pulp. The fruit's outer shell, or pericarp, is thick and leathery, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. It thrives in humid, coastal areas and plays a significant role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
