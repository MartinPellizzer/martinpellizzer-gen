    "intro": "Begonia beccariana, commonly known as the Bornean begonia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
