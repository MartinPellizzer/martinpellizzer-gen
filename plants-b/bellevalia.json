    "intro": "Bellevalia, commonly known as the \"star of Bethlehem,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and clusters of star-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Bellevalia is known for its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
