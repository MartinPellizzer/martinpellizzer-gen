    "intro": "Betula acuminata var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy birch, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are elliptical, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
