    "intro": "Brunsvigia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bracts or the sea lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Brunsvigia litoralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
