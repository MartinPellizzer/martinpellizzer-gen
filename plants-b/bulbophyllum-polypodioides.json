    "intro": "Bulbophyllum polypodioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leaf-like pseudobulbs and long, slender roots that help it anchor to trees or rocks. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small, ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses or botanical gardens."
