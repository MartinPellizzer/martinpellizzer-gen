    "intro": "Byblis aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that trap small insects, providing it with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water and support its carnivorous lifestyle. Byblis aquatica is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats."
