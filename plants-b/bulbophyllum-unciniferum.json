    "intro": "Bulbophyllum unciniferum, commonly known as the hooked-strap orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a single, elongated spike bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, have a distinctive shape with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects."
