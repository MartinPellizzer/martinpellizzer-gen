    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. syriacus, commonly known as the Syrian false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
