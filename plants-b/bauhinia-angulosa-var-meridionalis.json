    "intro": "Bauhinia angulosa var. meridionalis, commonly known as the narrow-angled bauhinia, is a species native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its distinctive, angular, leaflets that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
