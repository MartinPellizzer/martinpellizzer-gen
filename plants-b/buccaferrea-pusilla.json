    "intro": "Buccaferrea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf buccaferrera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features compact, rounded foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, bushy form. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
