    "intro": "Bursera occulta, commonly known as the hidden frankincense tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which is similar to frankincense and has been used traditionally in various cultural practices. The plant typically has small, ovate leaves and produces yellowish flowers that give way to small, woody fruits. Bursera occulta thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
