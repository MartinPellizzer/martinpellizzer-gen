    "intro": "Benthamia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Benthamia species are perennial herbs that are well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. They are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
