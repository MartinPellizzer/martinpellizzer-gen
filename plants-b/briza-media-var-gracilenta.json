It is characterized by its delicate, arching stems and feathery, slender spikelets that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in temperate climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
