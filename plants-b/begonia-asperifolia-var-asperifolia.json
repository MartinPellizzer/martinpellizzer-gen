    "intro": "Begonia asperifolia var. asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
