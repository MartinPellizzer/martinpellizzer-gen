    "intro": "Bulbophyllum reptans var. subracemosa, commonly known as the clustered flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. The orchid thrives in humid, warm environments and requires high light exposure for optimal growth."
