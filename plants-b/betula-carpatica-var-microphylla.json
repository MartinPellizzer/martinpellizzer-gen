    "intro": "Betula carpatica var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, rounded branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and white underneath. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers, and the tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
