    "intro": "Bistorta tenuicaulis var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf bistorta, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in alpine settings."
