    "intro": "Bulbocodium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed bulbous gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces a bulb-like structure underground, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
