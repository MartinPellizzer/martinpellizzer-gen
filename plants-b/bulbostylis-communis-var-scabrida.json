    "intro": "Bulbostylis communis var. scabrida, commonly known as the scabrid bristlegrass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, scabrous texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. This variant is distinguished by its coarse texture and is often found in wetland or disturbed habitats."
