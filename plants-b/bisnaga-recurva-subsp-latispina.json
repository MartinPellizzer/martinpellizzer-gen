    "intro": "Bisnaga recurva subsp. latispina, commonly known as the broad-spined bisnaga, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
