    "intro": "Bulbophyllum teretifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed torch orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
