It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
