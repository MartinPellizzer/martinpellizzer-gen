    "intro": "Brachypodium rupestre f. abbreviatum, commonly known as the compact bristlegrass, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its short, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a bristly appearance. It is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky crevices or along dry slopes."
