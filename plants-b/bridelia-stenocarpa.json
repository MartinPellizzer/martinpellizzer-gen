    "intro": "Bridelia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited bridelia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with latex-producing characteristics. The plant is notable for its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Bridelia stenocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
