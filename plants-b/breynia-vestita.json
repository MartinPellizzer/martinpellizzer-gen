    "intro": "Breynia vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Breynia vestita is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance."
