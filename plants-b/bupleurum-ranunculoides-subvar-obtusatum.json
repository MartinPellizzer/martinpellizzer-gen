    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides subvar. obtusatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a loose raceme, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
