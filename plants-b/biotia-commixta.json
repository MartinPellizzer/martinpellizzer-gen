    "intro": "Biotia commixta, commonly known as the mixed biotia, is a rare and delicate lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a symbiotic combination of algae and fungi. The plant exhibits a pale to yellowish-green coloration, often with distinct, irregular patterns on its surface. It is typically found growing on tree trunks and bark in temperate forest regions. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
