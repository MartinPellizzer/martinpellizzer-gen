    "intro": "Biophytum reinwardtii var. nervioides, commonly known as the veined ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is prostrate, forming dense mats that can spread across rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
