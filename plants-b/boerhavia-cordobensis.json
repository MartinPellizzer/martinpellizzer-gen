    "intro": "Boerhavia cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba blite, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Boerhavia cordobensis is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent foliage and shallow root system."
