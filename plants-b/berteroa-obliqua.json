    "intro": "Berteroa obliqua, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
