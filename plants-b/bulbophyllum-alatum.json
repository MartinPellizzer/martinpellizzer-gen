It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
