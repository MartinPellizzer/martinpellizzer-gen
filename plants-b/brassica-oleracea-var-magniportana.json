    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. magniportana, commonly known as the cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage species characterized by its dense, white curd made up of tightly packed flower buds. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other members of the Brassica genus, such as broccoli and kale. The plant typically grows to a height of 40\u201360 cm, with large, dark green leaves that form a rosette at the base. The edible portion is the undeveloped flower head, which is harvested before the flowers open, ensuring a crisp and tender texture. This variety is valued for its nutritional content, including vitamins C and K, and is a staple in many cuisines worldwide."
