    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides f. souliaei, commonly known as the souliaei buttercup, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like foliage that gives it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
