    "intro": "Bulbostylis breviculmis, commonly known as the short-styled bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact stature and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-parted flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
