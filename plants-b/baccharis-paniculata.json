    "intro": "Baccharis paniculata, commonly known as brittle bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Baccharis paniculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
