    "intro": "Betula vulcani, commonly known as the volcanic birch, is a unique species native to the volcanic regions of Japan. It is characterized by its striking white bark, which resembles the ash and rock formations of its volcanic environment. The tree has slender, drooping branches and produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its seasonal beauty. Betula vulcani thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic landscapes."
