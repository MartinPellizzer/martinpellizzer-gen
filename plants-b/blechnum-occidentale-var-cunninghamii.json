    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's hart's tongue fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble a heart shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
