    "intro": "Brachystegia ferruginea var. angustifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. The wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and tool-making in local communities."
