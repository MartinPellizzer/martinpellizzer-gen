    "intro": "Blechnum urbani, commonly known as the urban fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of leaves. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a unique pattern of sori on the underside."
