    "intro": "Bourreria tuxtlae, commonly known as the Tuxtla burr, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with woody stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces a unique, three-lobed fruit that splits open to release its seeds. Due to habitat loss, Bourreria tuxtlae is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
