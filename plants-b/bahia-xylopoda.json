It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along coastal areas and in dunes. It has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs.
