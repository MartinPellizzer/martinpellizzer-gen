    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum subvar. rupestre, commonly known as rock bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers. It is often found growing on limestone or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
