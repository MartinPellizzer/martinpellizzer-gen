    "intro": "Bassia laurifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical Bassia laurifolia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a hedge or topiary plant."
