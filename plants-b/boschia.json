    "intro": "Boschia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers that resemble small, delicate ghosts, hence their common name. Boschia species typically grow as shrubs or herbs, with opposite leaves and showy bracts that attract pollinators. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
