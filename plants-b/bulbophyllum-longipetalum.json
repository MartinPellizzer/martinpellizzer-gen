    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longipetalum, commonly known as the long-petaled orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, long, and narrow petals that are often brightly colored, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
