    "intro": "Bertolonia carmoi, commonly known as the Carmo\u00ed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Balsa*. The plant has a dense, leafy crown and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Bertolonia carmoi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
