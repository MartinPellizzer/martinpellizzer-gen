    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scandens, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, flexible stems that enable it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the wet season. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
