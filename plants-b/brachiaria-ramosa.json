It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often curl and twist. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. It is highly adaptable and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. Brachiaria ramosa is also valued for its use in livestock forage and its role in soil stabilization."
