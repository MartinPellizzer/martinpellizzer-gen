    "intro": "Byrsonima gaulterioides, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon basin. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits resembling large cherries. Its botanical significance lies in its unique fruit composition, which contains high levels of antioxidants and nutrients, making it valuable in both traditional and modern contexts."
