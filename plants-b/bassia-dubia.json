    "intro": "Bassia dubia, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss. Bassia dubia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
