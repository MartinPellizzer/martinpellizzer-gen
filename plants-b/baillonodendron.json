    "intro": "Baillonodendron, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and features woody stems with a distinctive, aromatic bark. The leaves are usually opposite, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often with five petals, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
