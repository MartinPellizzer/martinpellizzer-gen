    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its rugged habitat. Bulbophyllum sikkimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
