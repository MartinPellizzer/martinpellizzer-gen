It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid or seasonally dry environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. Bulbophyllum buchenauianum is often grown as a decorative orchid due to its unique floral structure and ornamental value."
