    "intro": "Betula alba lusus latifolia, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula alba lusus latifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
