    "intro": "Bletia hyacinthina var. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Liukiu Bletia, is a rare orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, violet-blue flowers during the spring. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
