    "intro": "Baskervilla auriculata var. yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas Baskervilla, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid subtropical forests of the Yungas region in Bolivia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a deep green coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires high levels of humidity and partial shade. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
