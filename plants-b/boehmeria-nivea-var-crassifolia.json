    "intro": "Boehmeria nivea var. crassifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hemp, is a variant of the nettle family (Urticaceae) native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional textiles and papermaking."
