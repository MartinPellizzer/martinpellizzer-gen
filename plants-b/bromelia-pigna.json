    "intro": "Bromelia pigna, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous husk. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears showy, red or orange bracts, which are not actual flowers but serve to attract pollinators. Bromelia pigna is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, known for its ability to store water in its leaf axils, making it well adapted to humid, tropical environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
