    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. amphilahensis, commonly known as the creeping bluemink, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and disturbed habitats."
