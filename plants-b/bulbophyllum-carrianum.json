    "intro": "Bulbophyllum carrianum, commonly known as the Carrian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers are often clustered together, making it a visually striking addition to tropical gardens."
