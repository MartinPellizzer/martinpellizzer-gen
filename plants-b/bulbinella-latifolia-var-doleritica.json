    "intro": "Bulbinella latifolia var. doleritica, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulbinella, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features rosettes of broad, fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped, cream to pale yellow flowers during spring. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
