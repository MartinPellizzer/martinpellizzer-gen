    "intro": "Bactris penicillata, commonly known as the pink pineapple or pink guava, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its clustering growth habit. The plant produces a distinctive fruit with a pink or red coloration, which is edible and has a sweet, tropical flavor. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a fan shape, typical of many palm species. Bactris penicillata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic qualities."
