It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking white petals and a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette pattern near the ground. Due to its rarity and cultural significance, Beneditaea is highly valued in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
