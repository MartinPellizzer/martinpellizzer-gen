    "intro": "Besleria saxicola, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Besleria saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
