    "intro": "Bromus barbatoides, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often covered in short, hairy structures. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments. Bromus barbatoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
