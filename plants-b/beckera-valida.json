It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care. Beckera valida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
