    "intro": "Banksia fraseri var. oxycedra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its striking cylindrical inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody cones that contain hard, persistent seeds, which are released after a fire or when the cones open naturally. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
