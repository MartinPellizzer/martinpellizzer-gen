    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically lance-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat and morphological features."
