It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for making textiles and paper."
