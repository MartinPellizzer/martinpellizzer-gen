    "intro": "Begonia ravenii, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often marbled with silver or white patterns. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among indoor gardeners and collectors."
