    "intro": "Bobartia parva, commonly known as the small bobartia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
