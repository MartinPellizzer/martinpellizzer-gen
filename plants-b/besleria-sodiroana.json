It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a rhizomatous perennial, often forming dense clumps with broad, glossy leaves. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments.
