    "intro": "Bellis perennis var. caulescens, commonly known as the cushion daisy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense, mat-like growth habit with tightly packed, woolly leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
