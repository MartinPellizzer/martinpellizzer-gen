    "intro": "Baeckea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered baeckea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. These flowers bloom in spring and are followed by small, woody capsules that contain several seeds. Baeckea parviflora is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
