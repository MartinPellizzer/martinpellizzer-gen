    "intro": "Blechnum parvulum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with dense clusters of lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's compact size and ornamental fronds make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
