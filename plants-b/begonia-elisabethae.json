    "intro": "Begonia elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the island of Java. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
