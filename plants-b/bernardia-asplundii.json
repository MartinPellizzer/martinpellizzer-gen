    "intro": "Bernardia asplundii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, edible fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardia asplundii is considered a rare and endangered species."
