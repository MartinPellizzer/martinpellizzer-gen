    "intro": "Brickellia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Brickellia palmeri is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
