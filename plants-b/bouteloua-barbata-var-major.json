It is characterized by its dark green, wiry foliage and distinctive, bristly seed heads. This grass thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.

Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for native plant landscapes."
