    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris f. serrata, commonly known as the serrated barberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in autumn. The plant has thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that give it its common name. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant foliage and hardy nature. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming them."
