    "intro": "Bulbophyllum putaoensis, commonly known as the Putao orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of northern Myanmar. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral characteristics."
