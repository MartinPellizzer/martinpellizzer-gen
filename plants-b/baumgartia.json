    "intro": "Baumgartia, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble small bells, often blooming in clusters. Baumgartia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
