    "intro": "Balanophora celebica, commonly known as the Celebes ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on trees in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
