The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical use in herbal medicine."
