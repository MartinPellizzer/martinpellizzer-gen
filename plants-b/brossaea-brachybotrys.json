    "intro": "Brossaea brachybotrys, commonly known as the short-stemmed brossaea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and sunny habitats, such as dry slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, round fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
