    "intro": "Brownea holtonii, commonly known as the yellow-bellied bower vine, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces long, twisting vines that climb towards the canopy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
