    "intro": "Baccharis linearifolia subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its linear, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in the fall and are followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests and grasslands, and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
