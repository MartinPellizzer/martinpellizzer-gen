    "intro": "Bromus scopulorum, commonly known as the rock brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is typically found in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray glumes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Bromus scopulorum is an important component of grassland ecosystems and can serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
