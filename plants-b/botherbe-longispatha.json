    "intro": "Botherbe longispatha, commonly known as the long-spurred orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. Its most distinctive feature is the elongated, spurred petal that extends from the flower's base, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. B. longispatha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
