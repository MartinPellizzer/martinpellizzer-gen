    "intro": "Baccharis pendula, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that appear in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and scrublands. Baccharis pendula is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
