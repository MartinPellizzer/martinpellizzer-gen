    "intro": "Baccharis saxatilis, commonly known as rock baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a valuable plant for erosion control. Baccharis saxatilis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
