    "intro": "Begonia gilgiana, commonly known as the Gilgian begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia gilgiana is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
