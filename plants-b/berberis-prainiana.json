    "intro": "Berberis prainiana, commonly known as the Prain's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous regions, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its yellow flowers appear in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a sharp taste. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
