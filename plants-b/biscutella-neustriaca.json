    "intro": "Biscutella neustriaca, commonly known as the European biscuit flower, is a small annual herb native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Biscutella neustriaca is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
