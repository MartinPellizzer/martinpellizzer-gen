    "intro": "Baccharis nebulae, commonly known as the cloud baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Baccharis nebulae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
