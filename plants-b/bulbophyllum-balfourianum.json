    "intro": "Bulbophyllum balfourianum, commonly known as the Balfour's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces showy, white to pale yellow blossoms that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
