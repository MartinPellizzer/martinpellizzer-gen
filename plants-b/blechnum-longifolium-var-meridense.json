    "intro": "Blechnum longifolium var. meridense, commonly known as the long-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a variant of the harts-tongue fern native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
