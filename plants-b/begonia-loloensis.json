    "intro": "Begonia loloensis, commonly known as the Lolo begonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
