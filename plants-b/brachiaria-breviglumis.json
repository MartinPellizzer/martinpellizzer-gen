    "intro": "Brachiaria breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed brachiaria, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, erect stems and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in pastureland due to its hardiness and nutritional value for livestock. Brachiaria breviglumis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas."
