    "intro": "Bocconia integrifolia subf. subtomentosa, commonly known as the silky bocconia, is a shrub native to the western Pacific, including parts of Japan and Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth margin and a thick, waxy texture. This sub-species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and compact growth habit."
