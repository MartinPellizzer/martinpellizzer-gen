    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis var. brevisiliqua, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock mustard, is a perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family, and its fruits are small, pod-like silique containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Due to its resilience, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
