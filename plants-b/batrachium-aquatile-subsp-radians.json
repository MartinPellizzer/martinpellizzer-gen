    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile subsp. radians, commonly known as the aquatic frog plant, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of South America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged substrates. The plant's fronds are typically elongated and ribbon-like, with a distinctive marginal spore-producing structure called a sorus. Its reproductive cycle involves the release of spores into the water, facilitating dispersal to new habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
