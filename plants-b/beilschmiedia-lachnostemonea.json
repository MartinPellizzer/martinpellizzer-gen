    "intro": "Beilschmiedia lachnostemonea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of primary forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
