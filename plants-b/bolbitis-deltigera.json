    "intro": "Bolbitis deltigera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its soft, moss-like appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that forms dense mats, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery texture. Bolbitis deltigera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas. Its distinctive appearance and growth habit make it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
