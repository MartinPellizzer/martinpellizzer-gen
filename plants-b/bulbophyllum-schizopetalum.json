    "intro": "Bulbophyllum schizopetalum, commonly known as the split-petals orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, typically growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it derives its nutrients from the surrounding environment. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers with a distinctive split-petals structure, which is a key feature in its common name. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often arid or shaded habitat. This orchid is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
