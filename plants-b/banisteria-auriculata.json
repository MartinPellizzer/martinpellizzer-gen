    "intro": "Banisteria auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Banisteria auriculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
