    "intro": "Bauhinia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock bauhinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, consisting of many small, oval-shaped leaflets. Bauhinia saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
