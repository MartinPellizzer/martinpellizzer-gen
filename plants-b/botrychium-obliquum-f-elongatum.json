    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum f. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, sporangiferous fronds that bear spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its morphology includes a short, erect stem with a single, divided frond that is longer than the stem itself. Botrychium obliquum f. elongatum is a rare and ancient plant species, often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions."
