The plant thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires stable water parameters to flourish. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Bucephalandra gigantea is a popular choice among aquarists due to its hardy nature and minimal maintenance requirements."
