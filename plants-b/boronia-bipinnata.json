It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring dense, compact foliage. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the flowers are borne on short pedicels. Boronia bipinnata is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
