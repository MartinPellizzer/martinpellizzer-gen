It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can climb by twining around supports, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
