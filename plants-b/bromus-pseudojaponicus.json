    "intro": "Bromus pseudojaponicus, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib. Bromus pseudojaponicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
