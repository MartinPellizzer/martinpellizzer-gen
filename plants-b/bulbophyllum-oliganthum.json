    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oliganthum, commonly known as the rare orchid of the genus Bulbophyllum, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It possesses thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its often-dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as an endangered species in its native range."
