It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Boerhavia graminicola is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
