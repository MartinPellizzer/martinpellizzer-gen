    "intro": "Benzoin glaucum var. glabellum, commonly known as the smooth benzoin, is a rare and unique variant of the benzoin plant. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and produces a fragrant resin that has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine. Its botanical features include a woody stem and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native range."
