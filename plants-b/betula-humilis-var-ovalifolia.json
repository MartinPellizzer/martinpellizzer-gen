    "intro": "Betula humilis var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale white underneath. The bark of this variety is smooth and typically light gray, becoming fissured with age. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
