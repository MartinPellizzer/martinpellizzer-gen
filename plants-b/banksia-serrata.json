    "intro": "Banksia serrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, giving it its common name. Banksia serrata is an important species in the ecological communities of its native habitat."
