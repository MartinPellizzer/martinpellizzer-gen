    "intro": "Belonophora, commonly known as the \"false pomegranate,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. Belonophora species produce small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, similar in appearance to pomegranates. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
