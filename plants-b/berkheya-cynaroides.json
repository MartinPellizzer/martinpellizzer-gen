    "intro": "Berkheya cynaroides, commonly known as the African crownbeard, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble those of the dandelion, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. The plant has silvery-gray, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. Berkheya cynaroides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
