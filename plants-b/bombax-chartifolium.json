    "intro": "Bombax chartifolium, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to red bract-covered flowers that bloom in the dry season. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine and for making ropes. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
