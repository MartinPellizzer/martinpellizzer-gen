It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates as a decorative houseplant."
