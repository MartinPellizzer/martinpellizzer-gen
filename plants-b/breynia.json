    "intro": "Breynia, commonly known as the fireplant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking, often red or orange-colored leaves that resemble flames, hence its common name. Breynia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some varieties producing small, capsule-like fruits. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
