    "intro": "Bromelia tricolor, commonly known as the three-color bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that displays three distinct shades of green, red, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the growth of its flowering stems. Its flowers, which are typically orange or red, bloom in a spike and are followed by small, showy bracts. Bromelia tricolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its visual appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
