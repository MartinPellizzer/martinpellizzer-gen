    "intro": "Bombax faroense, commonly known as the Faroe cotton tree, is a tropical plant native to the Faroe Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in coastal areas with sandy soil and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small birds."
