    "intro": "Brachypodium schumannianum, commonly known as Schumann's brachypodium, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
