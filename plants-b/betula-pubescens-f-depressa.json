    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a shrub-like form of the silver birch. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often reaching only a few meters in height. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a serrated margin. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in boreal and subarctic regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family."
