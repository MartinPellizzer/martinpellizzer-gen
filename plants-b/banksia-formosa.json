    "intro": "Banksia formosa, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Banksia formosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its unique floral structure and ecological importance make it a significant species in Australian flora."
