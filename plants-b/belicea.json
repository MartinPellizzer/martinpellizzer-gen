    "intro": "Belicea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Belicea is known for its rapid growth and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is also sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
