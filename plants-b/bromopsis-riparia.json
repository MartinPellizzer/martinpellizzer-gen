    "intro": "Bromopsis riparia, commonly known as the river rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along rivers, streams, and lakeshores. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in aquatic environments. Bromopsis riparia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
