    "intro": "Borreria saponariifolia, commonly known as the soapberry shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their saponin content. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Borreria saponariifolia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
