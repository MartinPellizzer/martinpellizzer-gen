    "intro": "Broughtonia fusca, commonly known as the dwarf rainforest plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. Broughtonia fusca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
