    "intro": "Buxus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with oval, leathery leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning make it a versatile plant in landscaping."
