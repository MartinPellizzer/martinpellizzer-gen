    "intro": "Buphthalmum scandens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with thin, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Buphthalmum scandens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
