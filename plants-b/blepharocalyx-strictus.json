    "intro": "Blepharocalyx strictus, commonly known as the wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name and help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a dense canopy that provides shade. The wood of Blepharocalyx strictus is valued for its durability and is used in traditional craftsmanship and construction."
