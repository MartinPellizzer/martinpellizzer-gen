    "intro": "Begonia cardiophora, commonly known as the heart-shaped begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia cardiophora is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
