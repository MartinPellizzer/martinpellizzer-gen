    "intro": "Bromus asper var. depauperatus, commonly known as the scabrous grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and often clustered closely together. This variety is distinguished by its reduced floral structures and shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other Bromus species."
