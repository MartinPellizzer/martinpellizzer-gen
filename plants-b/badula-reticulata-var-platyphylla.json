    "intro": "Badula reticulata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a robust root system and a sprawling growth habit, with thick, fleshy stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive net-like venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
