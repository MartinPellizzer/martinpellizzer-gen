    "intro": "Bergenia ligulata, commonly known as narrowleaf bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features rosettes of dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Bergenia ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
