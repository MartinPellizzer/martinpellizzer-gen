    "intro": "Banisteria fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed banisteria, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fringed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by ornamental, winged fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. However, it can be invasive in some areas if not properly managed."
