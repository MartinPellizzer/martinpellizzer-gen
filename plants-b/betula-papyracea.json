    "intro": "Betula papyracea, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of northern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, which gives it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has slender, pendulous branches. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula papyracea is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
