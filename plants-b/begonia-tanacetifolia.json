    "intro": "Begonia tanacetifolia, commonly known as the Daisy Begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its finely toothed, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the daisy plant, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often grown as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
