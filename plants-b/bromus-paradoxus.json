It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus paradoxus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Its ecological significance includes providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in arid environments."
