It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Boerhavia ramulosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
