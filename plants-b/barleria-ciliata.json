    "intro": "Barleria ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or hairy barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped with cilia (fine hairs) along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Barleria ciliata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
