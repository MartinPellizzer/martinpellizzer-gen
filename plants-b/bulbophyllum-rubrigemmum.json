It is characterized by its striking red and green foliage, which features distinctive red veins and a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant orchid flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
