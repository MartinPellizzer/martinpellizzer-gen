    "intro": "Bulbophyllum odoratum var. niveum, commonly known as the White Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
