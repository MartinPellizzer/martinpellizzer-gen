    "intro": "Biophytum sensitivum var. poterioides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun. Its unique behavior and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
