    "intro": "Boerhavia dichotoma, commonly known as the twin-stemmed bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branching stems that often spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Boerhavia dichotoma is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
