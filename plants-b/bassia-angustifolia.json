    "intro": "Bassia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
