    "intro": "Bulbophyllum caryophyllum, commonly known as the carnation orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, resembling the blooms of carnations. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The plant is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
