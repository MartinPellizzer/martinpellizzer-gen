    "intro": "Bassia quinquecuspis var. semiglabra, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with a branched stem and small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
