    "intro": "Brachystephanus africanus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet stephanus, is a rare and distinctive plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
