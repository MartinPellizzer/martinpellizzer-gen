    "intro": "Botor palustris, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs and marshes. The plant features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Botor palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
