    "intro": "Bromus villifer, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus villifer thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
