    "intro": "Bolbitis virens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its lush, dark green leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Bolbitis virens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
