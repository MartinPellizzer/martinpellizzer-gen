    "intro": "Bigelowia douglasii var. puberula, commonly known as the Douglas's bigelowia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically pubescent, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
