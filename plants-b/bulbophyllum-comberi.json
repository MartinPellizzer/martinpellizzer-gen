    "intro": "Bulbophyllum comberi, commonly known as the Comber's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Bulbophyllum comberi is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
