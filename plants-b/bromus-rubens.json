    "intro": "Bromus rubens, commonly known as red brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is an important forage plant for livestock and also serves as a host for various insects and fungi. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
