    "intro": "Bromus pseudodanthoniae var. pubiglumis, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is often covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
