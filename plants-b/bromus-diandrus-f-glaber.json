    "intro": "Bromus diandrus f. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous brome, is a variant of the brome grass characterized by its smooth, hairless surface. It is a perennial grass native to the western United States, typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This form is notable for its reduced foliage and is often used in ecological studies to understand plant adaptations to arid environments."
