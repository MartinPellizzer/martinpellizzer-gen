    "intro": "Boswellia scopulorum, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested from its branches and used in incense, medicine, and perfumery. Boswellia scopulorum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various desert species and contributing to soil stability in its native regions."
