    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus characterized by its hairy or pubescent surfaces. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, with a distinct pubescence along the edges. This form is notable for its ecological adaptability and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
