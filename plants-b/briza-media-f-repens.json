    "intro": "Briza media f. repens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that becomes more intense in full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
