    "intro": "Bulbophyllum annandalei, commonly known as the Annandale's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a unique lip structure that aids in pollination. Its rhizomes and pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
