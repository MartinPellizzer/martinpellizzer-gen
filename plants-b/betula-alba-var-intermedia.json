    "intro": "Betula alba var. intermedia, commonly known as the silver birch variant, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, drooping branches. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
