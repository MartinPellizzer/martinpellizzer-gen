    "intro": "Baccharis teucrifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Baccharis teucrifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
