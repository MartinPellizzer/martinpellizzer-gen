It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils, often in coastal or tidal areas, and is adapted to brackish or saline conditions. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on wind pollination. Bulbostylis ovatus is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands."
