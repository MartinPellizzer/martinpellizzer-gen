It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
