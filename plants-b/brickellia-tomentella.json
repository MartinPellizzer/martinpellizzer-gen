    "intro": "Brickellia tomentella, commonly known as wooly brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal heads. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Brickellia tomentella is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
