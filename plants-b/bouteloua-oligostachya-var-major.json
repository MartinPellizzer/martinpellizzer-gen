It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in native plant landscaping."
