    "intro": "Betula papyracea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch species native to parts of Asia and the Russian Far East. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
