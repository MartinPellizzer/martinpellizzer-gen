    "intro": "Baccharis loxensis var. oligocephala, commonly known as the Brazilian burr bush, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, wiry branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by woody, spiny fruits. It is adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
