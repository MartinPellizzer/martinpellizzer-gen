    "intro": "Bellis scandens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, often with a slightly wavy margin. Bellis scandens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and garden beds."
