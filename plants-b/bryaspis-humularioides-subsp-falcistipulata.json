    "intro": "Bryaspis humularioides subsp. falcistipulata, commonly known as the falcate-tipped clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear whorls of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that are elongated and often have a distinctive, curved tip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. This subspecies is notable for its primitive morphology and its role in the study of early plant evolution."
