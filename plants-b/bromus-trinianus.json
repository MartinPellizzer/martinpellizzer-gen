    "intro": "Bromus trinianus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. Bromus trinianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
