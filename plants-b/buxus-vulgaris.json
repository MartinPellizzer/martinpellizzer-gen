    "intro": "Buxus vulgaris, commonly known as common boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into topiaries make it a popular choice in horticulture. Buxus vulgaris thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for various garden settings."
