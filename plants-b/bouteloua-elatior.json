    "intro": "Bouteloua elatior, commonly known as hairy grama, is a native grass species found in the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common component of native grasslands. Hairy grama is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
