    "intro": "Brachistus dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows low to the ground, with a sprawling habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive, lobed shape, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Brachistus dimorphus is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in conditions of limited water availability."
