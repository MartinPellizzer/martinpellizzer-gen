    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oreogenum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
