    "intro": "Brassica sabularia var. papillaris, commonly known as the rough wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along streambanks and walls. This variety is distinguished by its papillate (bump-like) structures on the leaves, which give it its specific name."
