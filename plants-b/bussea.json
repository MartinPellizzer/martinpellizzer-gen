    "intro": "Bussea, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or khejri tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its deep root system helps it survive in poor soils and drought conditions. Bussea is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports agricultural practices in the region."
