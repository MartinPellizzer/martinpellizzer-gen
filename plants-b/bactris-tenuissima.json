    "intro": "Bactris tenuissima, commonly known as the dwarf palm or small-leaf palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce yellow flowers, which are followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Bactris tenuissima is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
