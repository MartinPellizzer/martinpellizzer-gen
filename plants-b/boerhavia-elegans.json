    "intro": "Boerhavia elegans, commonly known as the pretty blushing bride, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate ornamental quality to gardens. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Boerhavia elegans is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ability to spread easily and its drought-tolerant nature."
