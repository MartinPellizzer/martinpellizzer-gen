    "intro": "Bromus fasciculatus var. fallax, commonly known as fallax brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
