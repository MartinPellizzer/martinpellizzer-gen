    "intro": "Butyrospermum parkii var. cuneatum, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a variant of the shea tree native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces a valuable nut used for extracting shea butter. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit contains a high oil content, which is essential for both traditional and industrial uses. The tree also plays a crucial role in local ecosystems and is often used in agroforestry systems."
