    "intro": "Bidens rueppellioides, commonly known as the yellow beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, branched stems and hairy leaves, with yellow flowers that bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
