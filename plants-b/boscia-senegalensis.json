    "intro": "Boscia senegalensis, commonly known as the sour fig or wild date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dense, rounded crown, which provides habitat for various animals. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Boscia senegalensis is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional African medicine."
