It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop. Its seeds are small and oval, typically harvested for livestock feed or seed propagation."
