    "intro": "Bromelia commeliniana, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that typically displays red or orange hues. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports a variety of microorganisms and small animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few weeks before the plant produces a new growth from the base."
