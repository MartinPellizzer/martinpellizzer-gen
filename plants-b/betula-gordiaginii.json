    "intro": "Betula gordiaginii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a rare and endangered species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and distinctive, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and reddish-brown beneath. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
