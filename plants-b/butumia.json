    "intro": "Butumia, commonly known as the false olive, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. Butumia species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
