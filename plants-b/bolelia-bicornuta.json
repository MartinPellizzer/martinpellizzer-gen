    "intro": "Bolelia bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned fern, is a unique species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear two prominent, horn-like projections, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, and it relies on spores for propagation. Bolelia bicornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
