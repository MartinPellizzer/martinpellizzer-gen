    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leucorhachis, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking white or pale green pseudobulbs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with yellow and white petals, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
