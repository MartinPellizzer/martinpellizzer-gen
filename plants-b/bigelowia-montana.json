    "intro": "Bigelowia montana, commonly known as the mountain bigelowia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval fruits called cypselae. Bigelowia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
