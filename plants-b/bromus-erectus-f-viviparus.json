This plant exhibits vivipary, a phenomenon where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. It typically grows in temperate regions, often in disturbed soils such as roadsides or fields. The plant has a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its ecological role includes contributing to soil stabilization and serving as forage for grazing animals."
