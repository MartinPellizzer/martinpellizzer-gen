    "intro": "Begonia didyma, commonly known as the velvet leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a rich sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
