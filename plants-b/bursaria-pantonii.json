    "intro": "Bursaria pantonii, commonly known as the silver leaf bursaria, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Bursaria pantonii is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions."
