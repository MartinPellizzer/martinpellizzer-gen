    "intro": "Begonia umbraculifolia var. flocculosa, commonly known as the cloud begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its velvety, fuzzy leaves that resemble clouds. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, it thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from spring to summer. Its foliage is particularly notable for its dense, velvety texture, which adds a unique aesthetic to indoor or greenhouse settings. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
