    "intro": "Bracteolaria, commonly known as the \"Cape ivy,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and includes several species that are often found in rocky or coastal habitats. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Bracteolaria species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some varieties growing as climbers. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their attractive foliage and flowering habits."
