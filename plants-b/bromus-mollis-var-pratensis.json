It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
