    "intro": "Betula pumila var. renifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, elongated leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The bark of this variety is smooth and pale, often developing a flaky texture as the tree matures. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams."
