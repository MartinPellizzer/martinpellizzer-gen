    "intro": "Blechnum ambiguum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive pattern of sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators."
