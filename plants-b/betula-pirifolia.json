    "intro": "Betula pirifolia, commonly known as the cherry birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The bark of Betula pirifolia is smooth and pale, often with a reddish tint, and exfoliates in thin, papery strips. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. This ornamental tree is valued for its graceful appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
