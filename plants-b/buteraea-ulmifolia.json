    "intro": "Buteraea ulmifolia, commonly known as the common sycamore or the European sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks. Buteraea ulmifolia is valued for its ornamental bark and its role in supporting local wildlife."
