    "intro": "Bulbophyllum heidelbergianum, commonly known as the Heidelberg orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, organic soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less favorable conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
