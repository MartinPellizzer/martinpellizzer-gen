    "intro": "Bolivicactus schwebsianus, commonly known as the Schwebes' bolivian cactus, is a species of cactus native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is characterized by its columnar stem, which is typically ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the stem tips. It is adapted to arid and cold environments, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
