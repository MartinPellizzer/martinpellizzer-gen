    "intro": "Bizonula, commonly known as the golden bison grass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bright yellow-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bizonula is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils, making it a hardy ornamental and forage plant. Its resilience and aesthetic appeal make it a valued species in alpine gardens and ecological restoration projects."
