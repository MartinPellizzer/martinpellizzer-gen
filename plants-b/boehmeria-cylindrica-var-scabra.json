    "intro": "Boehmeria cylindrica var. scabra, commonly known as rough horseweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a distinctive, rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Boehmeria cylindrica var. scabra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
