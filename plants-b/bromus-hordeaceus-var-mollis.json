    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. mollis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Smooth brome is valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment."
