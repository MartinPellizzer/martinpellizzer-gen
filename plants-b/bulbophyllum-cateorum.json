    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cateorum, commonly known as the Cate's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive coloration that varies by species. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
