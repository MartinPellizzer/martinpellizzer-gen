    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed bulbostylis, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense arrangement along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its compressed or narrowed stem structure, which is a key feature in its botanical classification. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil."
