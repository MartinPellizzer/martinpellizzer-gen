    "intro": "Betula cylindrostachya var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-barked birch, is a variant of the cylindrostachya birch species. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that lacks the typical flaky texture found in other birch species. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, pendulous catkins and is typically found in cool, moist environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
