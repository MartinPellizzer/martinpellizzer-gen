    "intro": "Buxus fortunei, commonly known as Fortune's boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain glossy throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is highly valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. Buxus fortunei prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
