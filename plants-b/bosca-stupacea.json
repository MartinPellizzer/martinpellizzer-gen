    "intro": "Bosca stupacea, commonly known as the stinking wonder, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract certain pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Bosca stupacea is often found in moist, shaded areas near rivers and in dense forests."
