    "intro": "Barleria oxyphylla, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red tubular flowers, which are borne in terminal spikes. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Barleria oxyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils."
