It features fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
