    "intro": "Bromheadia pungens, commonly known as the spiky bromhead, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Bromheadia pungens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections."
