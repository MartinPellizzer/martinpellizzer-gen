    "intro": "Brassia cyrtopetala, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper shape, and its erect, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Brassia cyrtopetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
