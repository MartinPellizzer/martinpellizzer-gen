    "intro": "Breynia subindochinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese breynia, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent leaves and branching structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Breynia subindochinensis is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
