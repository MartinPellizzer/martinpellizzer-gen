    "intro": "Bosistoa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical Africa. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Bosistoa species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, many species are threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
