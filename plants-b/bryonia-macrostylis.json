    "intro": "Bryonia macrostylis, commonly known as the large-styled bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and melons. The plant produces yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange, spiny fruits. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and lobed, often with a waxy coating. Bryonia macrostylis is known for its medicinal properties, though its toxic nature requires caution in handling and use."
