    "intro": "Baccharis pentodonta, commonly known as the smooth baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. These flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Baccharis pentodonta is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods."
