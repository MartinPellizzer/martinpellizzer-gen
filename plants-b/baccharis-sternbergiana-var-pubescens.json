    "intro": "Baccharis sternbergiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
