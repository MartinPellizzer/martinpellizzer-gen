    "intro": "Begonia quaternata, commonly known as the four-leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking combination of green and silver hues. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique leaf patterns, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
