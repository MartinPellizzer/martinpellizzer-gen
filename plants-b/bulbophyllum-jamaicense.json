    "intro": "Bulbophyllum jamaicense, commonly known as the Jamaican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean island of Jamaica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces elongated, linear leaves and bears small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
