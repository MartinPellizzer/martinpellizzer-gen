The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its dry habitat. Bertya opponens is often found growing in sandy soils and is a rare species due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements."
