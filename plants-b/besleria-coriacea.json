    "intro": "Besleria coriacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost velvety texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange in color, often with a contrasting white or yellow center. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant. Besleria coriacea is well-suited for greenhouse or indoor cultivation due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures."
