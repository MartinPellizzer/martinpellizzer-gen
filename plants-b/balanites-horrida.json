    "intro": "Balanites horrida, commonly known as the African burr bush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its spiny branches and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by fruit that contains hard, angular seeds. Balanites horrida is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having deep root systems. It is also valued for its medicinal properties and as a source of fodder for livestock."
