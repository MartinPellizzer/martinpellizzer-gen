    "intro": "Bonellia, commonly known as the \"barnacle worm,\" is a marine polychaete annelid belonging to the family Bonellidae. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a small, worm-like body with a specialized anterior region called the acicula. Bonellia typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to substrates such as rocks or shells. The plant-like appearance of its anterior end has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. Its ecological role includes contributing to benthic communities and serving as prey for various marine organisms."
