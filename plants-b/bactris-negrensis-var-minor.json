    "intro": "Bactris negrensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm or lesser bactris, is a small, compact palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a short trunk and a dense crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling cherries. Its leaves are palmate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
