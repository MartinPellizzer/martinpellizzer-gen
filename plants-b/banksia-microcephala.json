    "intro": "Banksia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Banksia microcephala is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological structure of its habitat."
