    "intro": "Brachyscome thomsonii var. membranifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to Western Australia. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and summer. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and have a distinctive silver or greyish hue due to their densely covered trichomes. This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
