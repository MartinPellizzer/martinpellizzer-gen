    "intro": "Betula tristis, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula tristis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
