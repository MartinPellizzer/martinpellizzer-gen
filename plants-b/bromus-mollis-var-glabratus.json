    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This grass is often used in agricultural settings for forage and in erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
