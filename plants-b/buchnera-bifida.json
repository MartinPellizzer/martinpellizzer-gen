    "intro": "Buchnera bifida, commonly known as the two-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which is typical for many lichens. Buchnera bifida typically grows on rocks and trees in temperate regions, thriving in moist and shaded environments. Its morphology includes a pale green to yellowish upper cortex and a darker lower cortex, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
