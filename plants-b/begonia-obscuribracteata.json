    "intro": "Begonia obscuribracteata, commonly known as the dark bract begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The plant produces unique bracts, which are modified leaves that enclose the flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
