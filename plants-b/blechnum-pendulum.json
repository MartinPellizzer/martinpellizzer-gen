    "intro": "Blechnum pendulum, commonly known as the weeping fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, cascading fronds that give it a distinctive, flowing appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce new shoots. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery texture. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas."
