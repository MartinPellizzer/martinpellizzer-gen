    "intro": "Begonia ruboides, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that have prominent red veins against a deep green background. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
