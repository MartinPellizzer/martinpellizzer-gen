It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are similar in appearance to pineapples. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for sustainable use, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local agricultural purposes."
