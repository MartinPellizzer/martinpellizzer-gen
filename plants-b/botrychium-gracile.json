    "intro": "Botrychium gracile, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, often curved frond with a distinct, segmented structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the frond. Botrychium gracile is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its rare and ancient lineage within the fern group."
