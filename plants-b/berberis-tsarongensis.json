    "intro": "Berberis tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of Nepal and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions."
