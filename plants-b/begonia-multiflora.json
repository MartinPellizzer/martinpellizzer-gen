    "intro": "Begonia multiflora, commonly known as the clustered begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Begonia multiflora is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season, adding continuous color to gardens and indoor spaces."
