    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tropidopous, commonly known as the twisted lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, twisted petals and a lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, often blooming in clusters during the rainy season. The botanical structure of Bulbophyllum tropidopous includes a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates."
