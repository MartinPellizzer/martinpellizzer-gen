    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dichilus, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that resemble torches, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, which is crucial for its survival in humid tropical environments. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts and horticulturists."
