    "intro": "Betula derbetica var. amnicola, commonly known as the Amnica birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in boreal forests. The plant has smooth, white to gray bark that peels in thin layers, and its leaves are triangular with serrated edges. It produces small, yellow-green catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The Amnica birch is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
