    "intro": "Bichenia crenata, commonly known as the waxy leaf bichenia, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often hairy on the underside, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Bichenia crenata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
