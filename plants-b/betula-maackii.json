    "intro": "Betula maackii, commonly known as paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Betula maackii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
