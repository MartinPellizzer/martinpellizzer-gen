It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and densely packed, giving it a neat, formal appearance. The plant is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense foliage, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in temperate climates. While it is relatively disease-resistant, it is susceptible to boxwood blight under certain conditions."
