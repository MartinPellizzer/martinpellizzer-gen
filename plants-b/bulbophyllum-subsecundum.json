    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subsecundum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive zigzag pattern on its petals. It requires bright, indirect light and a humid environment to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
