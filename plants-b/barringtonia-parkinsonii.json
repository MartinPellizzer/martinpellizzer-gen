    "intro": "Barringtonia parkinsonii, commonly known as the white cedar or white sand tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a unique fruit structure, with a fibrous, spiky outer layer that encases a fleshy interior containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Barringtonia parkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
