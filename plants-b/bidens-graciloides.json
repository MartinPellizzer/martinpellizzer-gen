It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 inches tall, featuring slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive, bristled seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in various habitats across its range."
