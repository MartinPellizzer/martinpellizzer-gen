    "intro": "Baptisia pendula var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved false indigo, is a deciduous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking, pendulous clusters of bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often larger than those of the typical Baptisia pendula. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
