    "intro": "Bradleia glochidion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Bradleia glochidion is known for its delicate and ephemeral beauty, making it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, it is listed as endangered in several regions."
