    "intro": "Bromus corniculatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spike with spikelets that are loosely arranged. Bromus corniculatus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and adaptability."
