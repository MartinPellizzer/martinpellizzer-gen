    "intro": "Baeothryon pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf thryon, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty air and drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
