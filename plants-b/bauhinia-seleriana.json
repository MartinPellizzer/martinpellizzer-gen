It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and often shed during the dry season, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically tubular and are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds. Bauhinia seleriana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
