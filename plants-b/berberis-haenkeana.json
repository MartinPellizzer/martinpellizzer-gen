It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
