    "intro": "Begonia splendens, commonly known as the velvet leaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia splendens is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and vibrant blooms."
