    "intro": "Brassia aristata, commonly known as the orchid with the spathaceous bracts, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the pseudobulb. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom during the warmer months. Brassia aristata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
