    "intro": "Bougainvillea spectabilis marmorata, commonly known as the marble pink bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, purple, and white, which are often more showy than the small, white flowers it produces. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 6 meters in height, with woody stems and dense foliage. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to produce its colorful blooms. The marmorata variety is noted for its distinctive variegated leaf patterns and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant."
