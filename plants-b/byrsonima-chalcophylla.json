    "intro": "Byrsonima chalcophylla, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The red mulberry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
