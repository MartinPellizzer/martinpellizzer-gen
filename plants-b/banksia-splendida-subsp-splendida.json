    "intro": "Banksia splendida subsp. splendida, commonly known as the Splendid Banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical yellow flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
