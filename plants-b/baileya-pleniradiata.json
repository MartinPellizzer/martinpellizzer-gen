    "intro": "Baileya pleniradiata, commonly known as the Arizona sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange ray flowers and a central disk of tubular florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as deserts and rocky soils, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Arizona sunflower is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
