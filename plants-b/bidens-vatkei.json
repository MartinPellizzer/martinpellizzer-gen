    "intro": "Bidens vatkei, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by bristly, seed-bearing structures. Bidens vatkei typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it an adaptable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
