    "intro": "Blechnum corralense, commonly known as the Corralense hartsia, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
