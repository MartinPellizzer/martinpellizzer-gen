It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
