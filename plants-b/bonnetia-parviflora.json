    "intro": "Bonnetia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Bonnetia parviflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
