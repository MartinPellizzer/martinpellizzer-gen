    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum f. occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in regions with cool, humid climates. This fern is noted for its primitive morphology and is considered a relict species with limited distribution."
