    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. hibernifolia, commonly known as the hairy birch or winter birch, is a subspecies of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often retained throughout the winter, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows in boreal and temperate regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
