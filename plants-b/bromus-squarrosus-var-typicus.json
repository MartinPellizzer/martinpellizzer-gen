    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. typicus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are often hairy and scabrous. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
