    "intro": "Bulbophyllum micronesiacum, commonly known as the Micronesia orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often-dry habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
