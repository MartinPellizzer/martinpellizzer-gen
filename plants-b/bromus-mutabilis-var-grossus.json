    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis var. grossus, commonly known as the giant brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
