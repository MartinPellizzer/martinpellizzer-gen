    "intro": "Blancoa, commonly known as the \"white bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Blancoa species are often found in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous areas, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. Their botanical features make them popular among gardeners and botanists interested in alpine flora."
