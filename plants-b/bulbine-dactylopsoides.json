It features fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
