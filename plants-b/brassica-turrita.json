    "intro": "Brassica turrita, commonly known as the turban cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Brassica turrita is often cultivated for its edible leaves and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
