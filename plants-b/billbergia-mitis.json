    "intro": "Billbergia mitis, commonly known as the silver vase plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, silvery-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia mitis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
