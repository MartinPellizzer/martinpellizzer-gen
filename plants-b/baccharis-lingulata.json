    "intro": "Baccharis lingulata, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. It has a woody stem and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Baccharis lingulata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its drought tolerance."
