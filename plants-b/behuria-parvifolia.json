    "intro": "Behuria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved behuria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in shaded gardens and traditional herbal practices."
