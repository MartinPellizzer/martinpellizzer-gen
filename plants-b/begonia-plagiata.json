    "intro": "Begonia plagiata, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Begonia plagiata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
