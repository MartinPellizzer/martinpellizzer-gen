    "intro": "Borreria velascoana, commonly known as desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Borreria velascoana is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
