    "intro": "Bernardia brasiliensis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate bernardia, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
