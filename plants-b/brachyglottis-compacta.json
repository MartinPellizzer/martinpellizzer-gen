    "intro": "Brachyglottis compacta, commonly known as the small-leaved flax, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Brachyglottis compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
