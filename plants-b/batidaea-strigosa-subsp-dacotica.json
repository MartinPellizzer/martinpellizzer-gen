    "intro": "Batidaea strigosa subsp. dacotica, commonly known as the Dakota bristlepod, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
