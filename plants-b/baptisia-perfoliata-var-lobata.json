    "intro": "Baptisia perfoliata var. lobata, commonly known as the Indian plantain or wild indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower spikes that appear in early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often mistaken for those of the common plantain. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
