    "intro": "Batrachium trichophyllum var. paucistamineum, commonly known as the small-stemmed frog's ear, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments with rich, organic soil. Its leaves are elongated and somewhat fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
