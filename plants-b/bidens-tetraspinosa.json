    "intro": "Bidens tetraspinosa, commonly known as the spiny tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with dark centers and spiny, bristly leaves. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
