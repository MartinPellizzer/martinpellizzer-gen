    "intro": "Bulbine floribunda, commonly known as the African marguerite, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. It grows from a short, thick stem and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
