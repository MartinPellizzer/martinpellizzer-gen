    "intro": "Bromus kerkerianus, commonly known as the Kerkerian brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Bromus kerkerianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
