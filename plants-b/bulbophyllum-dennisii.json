    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dennisii, commonly known as the Dennis's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually borne on terminal spikes and can last for several weeks. Bulbophyllum dennisii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
