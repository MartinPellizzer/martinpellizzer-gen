    "intro": "Banksia cypholoba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and distinctive yellow flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. Banksia cypholoba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
