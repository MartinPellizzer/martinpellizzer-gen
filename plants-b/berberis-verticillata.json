    "intro": "Berberis verticillata, commonly known as the spiral barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia. It features slender, twisted branches that give it a distinctive, spiraling appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
