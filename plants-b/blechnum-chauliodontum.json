    "intro": "Blechnum chauliodontum, commonly known as the narrow-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
