It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, spiny seed pods that disperse its seeds effectively. Bidens mandonii is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
