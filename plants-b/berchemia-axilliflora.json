    "intro": "Berchemia axilliflora, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Berchemia axilliflora is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils."
