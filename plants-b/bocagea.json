    "intro": "Bocagea, commonly known as the \"mock strawberry,\" is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Bocagea produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to strawberries but are not related to them botanically. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
