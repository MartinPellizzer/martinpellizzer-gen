    "intro": "Buxus arborea, commonly known as the tree boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus arborea is valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
