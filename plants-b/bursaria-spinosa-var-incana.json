    "intro": "Bursaria spinosa var. incana, commonly known as the woolly burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, grey-green foliage and spiny, woody fruits that resemble small burrs. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
