    "intro": "Banksia colorans, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces woody cones that remain on the plant for several years. Banksia colorans is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought."
