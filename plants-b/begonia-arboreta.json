    "intro": "Begonia arboreta, commonly known as the tree begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is also notable for its ability to retain moisture, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Begonia arboreta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
