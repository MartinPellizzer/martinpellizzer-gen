    "intro": "Blepharodon angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blepharodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lanceolate leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
