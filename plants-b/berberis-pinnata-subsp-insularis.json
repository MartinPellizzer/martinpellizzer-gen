    "intro": "Berberis pinnata subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island barberry, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It features slender, spiny stems and alternate, pinnate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
