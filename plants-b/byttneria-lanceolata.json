    "intro": "Byttneria lanceolata, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
