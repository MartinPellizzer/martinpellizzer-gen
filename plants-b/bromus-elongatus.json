    "intro": "Bromus elongatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned flowers. Bromus elongatus thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
