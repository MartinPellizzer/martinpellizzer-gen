    "intro": "Blechnum eburneum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a shimmering appearance. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
