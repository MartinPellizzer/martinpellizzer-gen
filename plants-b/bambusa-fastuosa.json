    "intro": "Bambusa fastuosa, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a striking ornamental grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green culms that contrast beautifully with its dark green leaves. The plant forms dense clumps and can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a popular choice for landscaping. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Bambusa fastuosa is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to create a lush, textured appearance in gardens."
