    "intro": "Buccella strigosa, commonly known as the hairy bough plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, strigose stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
