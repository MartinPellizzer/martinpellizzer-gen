    "intro": "Batocarpus maranhensis, commonly known as the Maranh\u00e3o batocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes plants such as cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
