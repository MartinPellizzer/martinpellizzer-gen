    "intro": "Bolbitis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to substrates and facilitates nutrient absorption. Bolbitis sumatrana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
