    "intro": "Bolbitis valida, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem covered with whorled leaves that are often described as resembling a pinecone. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are located at the top of the stem. Bolbitis valida is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Carboniferous period."
