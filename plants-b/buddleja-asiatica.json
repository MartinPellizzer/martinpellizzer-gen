    "intro": "Buddleja asiatica, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Buddleja asiatica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
