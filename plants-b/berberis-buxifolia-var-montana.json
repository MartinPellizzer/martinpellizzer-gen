    "intro": "Berberis buxifolia var. montana, commonly known as mountain barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in colder climates."
