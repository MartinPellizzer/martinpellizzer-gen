    "intro": "Bulbophyllum univenum, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, solitary flower that typically blooms in shades of yellow or orange. The plant produces a pseudobulb, which serves as a storage organ for water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient photosynthesis. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
