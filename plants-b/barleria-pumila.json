    "intro": "Barleria pumila, commonly known as dwarf barleria, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Barleria pumila is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
