    "intro": "Begonia floccifera, commonly known as the fluff begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, cotton-like hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
