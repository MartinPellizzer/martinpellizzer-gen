    "intro": "Bulbophyllum deminutum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
