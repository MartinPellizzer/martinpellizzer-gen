It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within coastal heathlands and woodland areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers during the winter months. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and locally significant species."
