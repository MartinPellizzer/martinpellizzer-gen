    "intro": "Batrachium baudotii var. marinum, commonly known as the marine batrachium, is a rare variant of the batrachium genus native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which features a thick, waxy cuticle to withstand saline conditions. The plant exhibits halophytic traits, allowing it to thrive in brackish or saltwater environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
