    "intro": "Betula sollennis, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silvery hue beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn golden in autumn. Betula sollennis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
