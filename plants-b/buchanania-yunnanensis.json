    "intro": "Buchanania yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan Buchanania, is a flowering plant species native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats within mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
