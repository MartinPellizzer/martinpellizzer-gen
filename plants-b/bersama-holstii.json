    "intro": "Bersama holstii, commonly known as the Holstii cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and preference for well-drained soil make it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
