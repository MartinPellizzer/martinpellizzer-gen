    "intro": "Baumea acuta, commonly known as the sharp rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, often emerging from a basal rosette. Baumea acuta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
