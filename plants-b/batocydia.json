    "intro": "Batocydia, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and showy, butterfly-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Batocydia species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They grow in shaded, moist environments, often as epiphytes on trees or as terrestrial plants in forest understories. The flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and moths, through their color and scent."
