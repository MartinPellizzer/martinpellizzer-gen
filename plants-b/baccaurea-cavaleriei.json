It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red or orange berries. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany, though it is not widely cultivated."
