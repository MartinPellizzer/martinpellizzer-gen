    "intro": "Bifrenaria villosula, commonly known as the hairy bifrenaria, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with dappled sunlight. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Bifrenaria villosula is considered a threatened species."
