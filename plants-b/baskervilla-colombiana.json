    "intro": "Baskervilla colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian baskervilla, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Baskervilla colombiana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
