    "intro": "Blechnopsis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
