    "intro": "Bauhinia lunarioides, commonly known as the moonflower bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature. Bauhinia lunarioides is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in horticulture for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
