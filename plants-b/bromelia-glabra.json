    "intro": "Bromelia glabra, commonly known as the smooth bromeliad, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically smooth and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
