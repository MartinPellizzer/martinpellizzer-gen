It features thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
