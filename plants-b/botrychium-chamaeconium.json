    "intro": "Botrychium chamaeconium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, club-shaped rhizome that supports its leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. Botrychium chamaeconium typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in the understory of forests."
