    "intro": "Barola, commonly known as the snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, spherical flowers that appear in early spring, giving it its common name. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. Barola thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
