    "intro": "Baccharis salicifolia subsp. salicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
