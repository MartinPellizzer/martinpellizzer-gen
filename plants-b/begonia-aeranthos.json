    "intro": "Begonia aeranthos, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety leaves with a silvery sheen and prominent veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage, though it can add subtle floral interest to the landscape."
