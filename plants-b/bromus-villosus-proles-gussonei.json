    "intro": "Bromus villosus proles gussonei, commonly known as the Gussonei hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. This grass is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in arid environments."
