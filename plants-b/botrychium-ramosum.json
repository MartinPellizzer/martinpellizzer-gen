    "intro": "Botrychium ramosum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, upright rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf. The leaf is divided into two parts, with the lower portion forming a rosette of small, spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls. Botrychium ramosum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with spores produced on the underside of the sporophylls."
