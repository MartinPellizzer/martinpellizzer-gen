It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, purple-pink flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters called florescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
