    "intro": "Bulbophyllum treschii, commonly known as the Red-tipped Pterostigma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals and a distinctive red-tipped lip, which are key features in its floral morphology. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Bulbophyllum treschii is typically epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments."
