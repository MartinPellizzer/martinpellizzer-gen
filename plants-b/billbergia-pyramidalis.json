    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant orange-red bracts. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers are small and white, emerging from the base of the inflorescence. Billbergia pyramidalis thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
