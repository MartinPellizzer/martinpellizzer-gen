    "intro": "Bauhinia dipetala var. deserti, commonly known as the desert bauhinia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several flattened seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia dipetala var. deserti is well-suited to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
