    "intro": "Blechnum cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a perennial fern native to New Zealand. It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces fronds that are typically heart-shaped, hence its common name. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth form with lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are evergreen, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
