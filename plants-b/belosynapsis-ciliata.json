    "intro": "Belosynapsis ciliata, commonly known as the silky synapsis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, silky leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
