    "intro": "Blechnopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, triangular pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
