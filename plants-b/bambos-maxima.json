It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, segmented stems that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in traditional construction and as a source of biomass. Bambos maxima thrives in wet, humid environments and is adapted to rapid growth cycles. Its structural strength and abundance make it an important resource in certain ecosystems."
