    "intro": "Buxus myrica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to parts of Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat shape make it ideal for hedges and topiary."
