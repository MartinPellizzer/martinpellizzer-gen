    "intro": "Bulbophyllum xylocarpi, commonly known as the sandstone orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces unique, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rock surfaces, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized growing conditions."
