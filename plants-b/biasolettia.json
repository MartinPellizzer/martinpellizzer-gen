    "intro": "Biasolettia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, with Biasolettia madagascariensis being the most well-known. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnate leaves. They produce cones rather than flowers, and their reproductive structures are unique to the cycad family. Biasolettia species are slow-growing and can live for hundreds of years, making them important components of their native ecosystems."
