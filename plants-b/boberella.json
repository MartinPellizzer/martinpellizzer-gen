    "intro": "Boberella, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its distinctive silver or gray foliage. The leaves are usually compound, with small, rounded leaflets that give the plant a silvery appearance. Boberella species often grow as shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
