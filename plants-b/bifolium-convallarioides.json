It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its berries are dark blue to black and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Botanically, it is closely related to the genus Convallaria, which includes the traditional poison ivy."
