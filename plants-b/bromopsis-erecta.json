    "intro": "Bromopsis erecta, commonly known as the upright bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Bromopsis erecta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
