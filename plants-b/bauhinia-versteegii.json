    "intro": "Bauhinia versteegii, commonly known as the velvetwood or yellow bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Bauhinia versteegii is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
