    "intro": "Banksia hispida, commonly known as the hispid banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Banksia hispida is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal and heathland environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the flora of Western Australia."
