    "intro": "Barkhausia triangularis, commonly known as the triangular barkhausia, is a distinctive shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique triangular-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Barkhausia triangularis is well-suited to dry, well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
