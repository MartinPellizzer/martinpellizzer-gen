    "intro": "Biscutella didyma var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky biscuit flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to fine cilia along the edges. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
