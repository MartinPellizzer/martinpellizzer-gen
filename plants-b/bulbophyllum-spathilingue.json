    "intro": "Bulbophyllum spathilingue, commonly known as the pink spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom in spikes, making it a visually appealing plant. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its leaves are typically broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in forest understories."
