    "intro": "Bulbophyllum clinocoryphe, commonly known as the narrow-lobed helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, helmet-shaped flowers. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat."
