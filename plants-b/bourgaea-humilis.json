    "intro": "Bourgaea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, purple, and red, which are often mistaken for flowers. The actual flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging from the base of the bracts. This plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain its health and bloom."
