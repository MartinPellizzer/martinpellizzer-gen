    "intro": "Banksia integerrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces hard, woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia integerrima is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
