    "intro": "Bromus lanceolatus var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
