It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique foliage and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Begonia lucifuga thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
