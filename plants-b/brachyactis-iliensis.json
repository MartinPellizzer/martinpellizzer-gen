    "intro": "Brachyactis iliensis, commonly known as the Ili Valley grass. This plant is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Ili River valley in China. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Brachyactis iliensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
