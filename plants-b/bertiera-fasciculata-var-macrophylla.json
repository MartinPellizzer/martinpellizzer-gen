    "intro": "Bertiera fasciculata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf bertiera, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often large and have a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds through a mechanism involving the explosive opening of the pod. This species is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils."
