It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
