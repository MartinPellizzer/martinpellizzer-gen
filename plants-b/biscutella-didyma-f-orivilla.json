    "intro": "Biscutella didyma f. orivilla, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its fleshy leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
