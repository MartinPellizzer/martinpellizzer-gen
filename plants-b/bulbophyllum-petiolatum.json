    "intro": "Bulbophyllum petiolatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and long, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and yellow, are often used in ornamental horticulture. Bulbophyllum petiolatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor growers."
