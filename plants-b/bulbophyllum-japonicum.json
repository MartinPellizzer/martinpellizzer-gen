    "intro": "Bulbophyllum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually borne on long, slender inflorescences, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
