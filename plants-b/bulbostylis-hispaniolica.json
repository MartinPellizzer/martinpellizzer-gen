    "intro": "Bulbostylis hispaniolica, commonly known as the Hispaniola bulbostylis, is a rare grass species native to the island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
