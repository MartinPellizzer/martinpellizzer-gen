    "intro": "Billbergia sphacelata, commonly known as the \"Brazillian Billbergia,\" is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its roots. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage is often variegated with yellow and green stripes, adding visual interest. Billbergia sphacelata is well-suited for indoor cultivation and thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity."
