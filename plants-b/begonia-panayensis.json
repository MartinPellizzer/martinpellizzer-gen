    "intro": "Begonia panayensis, commonly known as the Panay begonia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Panay in the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
