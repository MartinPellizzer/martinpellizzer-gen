    "intro": "Buchanania glaberrima, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
