    "intro": "Barleria lanceolata subsp. tristis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
