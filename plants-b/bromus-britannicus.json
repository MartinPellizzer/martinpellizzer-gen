    "intro": "Bromus britannicus, commonly known as the British brome, is a perennial grass native to the United Kingdom. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It is often found in acidic soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Bromus britannicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
