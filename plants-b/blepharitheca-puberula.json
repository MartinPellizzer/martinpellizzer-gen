It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
