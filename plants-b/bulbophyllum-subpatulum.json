    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subpatulum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
