    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed brome grass, is a variant of the brome grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness and ecological adaptability."
