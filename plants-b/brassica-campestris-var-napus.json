    "intro": "Brassica campestris var. napus, commonly known as rapeseed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, branching stems and large, alternating leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods containing round, hard seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but is now cultivated worldwide for its oil-rich seeds. Brassica campestris var. napus is also known for its high erucic acid content in some varieties, which has led to the development of lower-acid strains for agricultural and culinary use."
