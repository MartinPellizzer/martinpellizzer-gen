    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus subsp. briziformis, commonly known as the bristly brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, bristly lemma and palea, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
