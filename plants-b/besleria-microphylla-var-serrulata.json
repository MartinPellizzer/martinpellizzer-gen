    "intro": "Besleria microphylla var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated leaf begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
