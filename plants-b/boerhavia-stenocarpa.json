    "intro": "Boerhavia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited purslane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The small, pink or white flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
