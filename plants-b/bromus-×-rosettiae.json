    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 rosettiae, commonly known as the rosette brome, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits a distinctive rosette growth form. It is characterized by its tightly clustered, succulent-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. This plant is native to the western United States and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
