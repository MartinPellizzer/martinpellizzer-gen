    "intro": "Brachiaria orthostachys, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is widely used in pastures and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is well adapted to warm, moist environments."
