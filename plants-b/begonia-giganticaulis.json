    "intro": "Begonia giganticaulis, commonly known as the giant tree begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure, which can grow up to 10 meters tall, making it one of the tallest begonias. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are often green with a reddish or purple tinge, and it produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its unique morphology and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservatories. Due to its size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
