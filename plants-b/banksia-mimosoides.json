    "intro": "Banksia mimosoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind after the follicles open. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Banksia mimosoides plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for native wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of coastal and heathland habitats."
