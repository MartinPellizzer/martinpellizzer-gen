It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. These berries are rich in nutrients and are often used in local cuisines. Baccaurea multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
