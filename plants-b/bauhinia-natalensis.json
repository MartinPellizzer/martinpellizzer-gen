    "intro": "Bauhinia natalensis, commonly known as the Natal orchid tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feathery leaflets, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. Bauhinia natalensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
