It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, contributing to its common name."
