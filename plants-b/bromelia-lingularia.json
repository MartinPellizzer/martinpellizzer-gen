    "intro": "Bromelia lingularia, commonly known as the red-tipped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Bromelia lingularia is known for its ability to survive in shaded environments while still maintaining its vibrant appearance."
