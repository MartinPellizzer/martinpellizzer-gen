    "intro": "Begonia ehuangzhangensis, commonly known as the Huangzhang begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
