    "intro": "Bambusa viminalis, commonly known as the common bamboo, is a fast-growing, clump-forming grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are typically green or yellowish in color, with a smooth, sometimes slightly ribbed surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slight sheen. Bambusa viminalis is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of bamboo products. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of light conditions."
