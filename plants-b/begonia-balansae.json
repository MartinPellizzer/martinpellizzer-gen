    "intro": "Begonia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae begonia, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
