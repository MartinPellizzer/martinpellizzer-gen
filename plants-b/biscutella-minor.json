    "intro": "Biscutella minor, commonly known as the lesser biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are often lobed or divided, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated today. Biscutella minor is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in harsh climates."
