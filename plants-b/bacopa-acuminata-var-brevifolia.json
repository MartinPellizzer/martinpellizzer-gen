It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in ornamental gardens and as a ground cover."
