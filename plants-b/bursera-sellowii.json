    "intro": "Bursera sellowii, commonly known as the Sellow's bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by distinctive, resinous fruits that split open to release seeds. It is adapted to dry, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Bursera sellowii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some regions for its resin and wood."
