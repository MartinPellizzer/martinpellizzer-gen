    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Bermuda grass, is a variant of the species Bermudiana bermudiana. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow inflorescences, which set it apart from the typical green or brown flowers of the standard variety. This fern-like plant is native to the coastal regions of Bermuda and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing in open areas with full sun exposure. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
