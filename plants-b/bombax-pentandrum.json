    "intro": "Bombax pentandrum, commonly known as the red cotton tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The plant has a shallow root system and is relatively fast-growing, making it suitable for ornamental and reforestation purposes."
