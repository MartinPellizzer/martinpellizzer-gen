It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia pauciflora is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in its ecosystem."
