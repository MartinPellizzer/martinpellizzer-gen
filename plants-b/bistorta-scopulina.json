    "intro": "Bistorta scopulina, commonly known as the alpine bistorta, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has thick, rhizomatous stems that form dense clumps, and its leaves are typically broad and slightly hairy. It produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries. Bistorta scopulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
