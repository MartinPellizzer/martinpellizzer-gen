It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
