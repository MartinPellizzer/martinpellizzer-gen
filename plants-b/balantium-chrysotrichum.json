It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow inflorescences covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy in appearance. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.
