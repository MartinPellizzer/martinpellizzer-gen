    "intro": "Bunochilus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Bunochilus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
