It is characterized by its aromatic, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrowly elliptic and covered in fine, soft hairs, which distinguish it from other varieties. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrant blooms."
