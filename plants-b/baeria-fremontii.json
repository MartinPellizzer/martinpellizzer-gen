    "intro": "Baeria fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's baeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in full sun. Baeria fremontii is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
