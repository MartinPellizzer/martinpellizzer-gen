    "intro": "Bromus jubatus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while its seeds are small and dispersed by wind. Bromus jubatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
