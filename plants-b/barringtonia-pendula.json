    "intro": "Barringtonia pendula, commonly known as the white ghost tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds. The tree has smooth, greyish bark and can grow up to 30 meters tall. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
