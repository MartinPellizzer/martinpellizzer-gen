    "intro": "Bromus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that have a distinctive silver-gray margin. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, two-rowed spikelets that are often tinged with purple. Bromus marginatus is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it an important part of the coastal ecosystem."
