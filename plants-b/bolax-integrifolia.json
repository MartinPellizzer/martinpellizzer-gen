    "intro": "Bolax integrifolia, commonly known as the California buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic with smooth, entire margins. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves, and it thrives in dry, open habitats. Bolax integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
