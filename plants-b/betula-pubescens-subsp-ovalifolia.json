    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a serrated margin. The bark is white and smooth when young, developing fissures with age, and the tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
