    "intro": "Botrychium australe subsp. australe, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a small fern native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped sporangia that are clustered in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually simple and delicate, with a pale green coloration. Botrychium australe subsp. australe plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
