    "intro": "Blitum salsum, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Blitum salsum is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes."
