    "intro": "Bactris acanthocarpa var. intermedia, commonly known as the pink palm, is a species of palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-orange inflorescences, which give way to small, round fruits that are edible and have a sweet, fibrous pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands or near rivers. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in many regions for both aesthetic and agricultural purposes."
