It is characterized by its dense, velvety white tomentum that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
