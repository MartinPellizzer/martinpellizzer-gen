    "intro": "Blechnum asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain attached to the plant for several years. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitats."
