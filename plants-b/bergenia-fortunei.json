    "intro": "Bergenia fortunei, commonly known as the Caucasian rockfoil, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, erect stems. Bergenia fortunei is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for shady garden conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cold climates."
