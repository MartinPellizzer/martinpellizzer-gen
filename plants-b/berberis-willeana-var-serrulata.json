It features erect, spiny stems covered with small, yellowish-brown bark. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. Its leaves are elliptical, with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and attractive foliage."
