    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum f. europaeum, commonly known as the European moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, horizontally pinnate fronds that resemble a moon or crescent shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, fleshy structure called a sorus, which is positioned on the underside of the fronds. This fern is relatively rare and has a limited distribution in Europe, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
