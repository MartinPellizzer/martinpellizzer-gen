    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. korotkiji, commonly known as the Korotkij's bromus, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
