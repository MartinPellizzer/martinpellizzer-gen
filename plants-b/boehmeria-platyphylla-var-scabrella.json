    "intro": "Boehmeria platyphylla var. scabrella, commonly known as the roughleaf nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, characterized by its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, scabrous texture that gives it its common name. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
