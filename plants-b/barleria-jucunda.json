It features slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Barleria jucunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
