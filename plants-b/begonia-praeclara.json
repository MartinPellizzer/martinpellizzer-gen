    "intro": "Begonia praeclara, commonly known as the splendid begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green hue and prominent veins, often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor landscapes."
