It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and distinctive hairy margins along the leaf edges. This grass thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Hairy grama is an important component of native grasslands and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
