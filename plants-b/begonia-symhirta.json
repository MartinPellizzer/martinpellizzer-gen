    "intro": "Begonia symhirta, commonly known as the wax begonia, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white, green, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia symhirta is commonly used in hanging baskets and as a trailing plant due to its compact growth habit."
