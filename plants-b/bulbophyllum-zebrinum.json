    "intro": "Bulbophyllum zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique, segmented pseudobulbs and strikingly patterned leaves that resemble a zebra's stripes. It produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange with contrasting markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
