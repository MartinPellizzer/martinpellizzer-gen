    "intro": "Bupleurum stenophyllum var. kiusianum, commonly known as the Kiusianum angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clustered, small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated margin, while the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
