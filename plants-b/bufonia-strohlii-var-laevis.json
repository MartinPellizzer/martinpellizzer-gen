    "intro": "Bufonia strohlii var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth bufonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, spiky fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
