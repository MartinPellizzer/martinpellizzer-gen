    "intro": "Biscutella scaposa, commonly known as the scapose biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and slender, leafless stems that bear small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Biscutella scaposa is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
