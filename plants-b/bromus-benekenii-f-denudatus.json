    "intro": "Bromus benekenii f. denudatus, commonly known as the naked false brome, is a variant of the false brome species native to the western United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often partially or fully exposed, giving it its \"naked\" appearance. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
