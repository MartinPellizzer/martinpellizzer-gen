    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. multiflorum, commonly known as the multibranched false brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid growth, it is widely used in plant biology research."
