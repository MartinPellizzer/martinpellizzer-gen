    "intro": "Bauhinia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically light green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia cordifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
