It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent, hairy sepals that give it its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Banisteria pubipetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
