    "intro": "Bonafousia palustris, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a soft, fuzzy texture, and the plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Bonafousia palustris plays an important role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
