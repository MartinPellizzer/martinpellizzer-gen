    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus subsp. molliformis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
