    "intro": "Betula recurvata, commonly known as the zigzag birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Betula recurvata is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
