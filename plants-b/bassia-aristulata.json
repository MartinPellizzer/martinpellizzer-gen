    "intro": "Bassia aristulata, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Bassia aristulata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
