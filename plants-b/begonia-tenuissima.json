    "intro": "Begonia tenuissima, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its ornamental foliage. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful watering and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
