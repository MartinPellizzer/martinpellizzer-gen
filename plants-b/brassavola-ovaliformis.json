    "intro": "Brassavola ovaliformis, commonly known as the oval-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems. Brassavola ovaliformis is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
