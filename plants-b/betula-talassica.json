    "intro": "Betula talassica, commonly known as the coastal birch, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and smooth, gray bark that exudes a fragrant resin. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and dunes. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
