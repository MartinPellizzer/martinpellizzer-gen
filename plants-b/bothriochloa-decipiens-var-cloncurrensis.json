    "intro": "Bothriochloa decipiens var. cloncurrensis, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver-gray coloration due to fine pubescence. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its erosion-control capabilities."
