    "intro": "Bulbophyllum careyanum var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim Bulbophyllum, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single or few branched inflorescence bearing small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
