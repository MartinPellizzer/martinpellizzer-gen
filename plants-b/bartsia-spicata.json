It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in dense spikes, often in shades of pink or red. Bartsia spicata is known for its short life cycle and reliance on host plants for nutrients."
