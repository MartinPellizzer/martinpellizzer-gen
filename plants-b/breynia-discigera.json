    "intro": "Breynia discigera, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves make it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Breynia discigera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
