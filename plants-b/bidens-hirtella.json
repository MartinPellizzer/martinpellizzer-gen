    "intro": "Bidens hirtella, commonly known as roughleaf beggarweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features erect stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated margins and hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers, which appear in clusters, consist of two ray florets and numerous disk florets. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
