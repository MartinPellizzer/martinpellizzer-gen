It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a slightly serrated margin, and are often aromatic. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes."
