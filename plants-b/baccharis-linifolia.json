    "intro": "Baccharis linifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its aromatic leaves that emit a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and desert regions. Baccharis linifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
