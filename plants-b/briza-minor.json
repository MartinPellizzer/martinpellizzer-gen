    "intro": "Briza minor, commonly known as little quaking grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, arching stems that bear delicate, feathery spikelets, which sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Briza minor is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
