    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. insularis, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a neat, sculptural appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm, making it ideal for hedges, topiaries, and ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is a popular choice for formal garden designs."
