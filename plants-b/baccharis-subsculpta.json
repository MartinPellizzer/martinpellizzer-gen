    "intro": "Baccharis subsculpta, commonly known as the sculpted baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, sculpted appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Baccharis subsculpta is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
