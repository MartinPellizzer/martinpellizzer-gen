    "intro": "Bergia perennis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Bergia perennis is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
