    "intro": "Bowenia serrulata, commonly known as the Queensland cycad, is a unique cycad species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
