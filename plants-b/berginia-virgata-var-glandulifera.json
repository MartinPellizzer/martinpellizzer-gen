    "intro": "Berginia virgata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, leathery leaves that are often covered with glandular hairs, giving the plant its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
