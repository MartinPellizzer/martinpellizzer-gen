    "intro": "Balsamea mollis, commonly known as the sticky balsam, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Balsamea mollis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
