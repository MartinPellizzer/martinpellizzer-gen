It features thorny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive midrib. Berberis heteracantha is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
