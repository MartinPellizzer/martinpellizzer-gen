This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in wetlands and marshy environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to its modest size. The inflorescence is a dense, spherical cluster, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to form dense mats."
