    "intro": "Bursera caudata, commonly known as the Mexican angel's trumpet, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds when mature. Bursera caudata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
