    "intro": "Benthamia nivea subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the white benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and the species is characterized by its compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
