    "intro": "Bernoullia swietenioides, commonly known as the Swietenioides fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bernoullia swietenioides is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
