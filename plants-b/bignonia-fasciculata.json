    "intro": "Bignonia fasciculata, commonly known as the yellow bell vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces striking yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or structures. Bignonia fasciculata is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
