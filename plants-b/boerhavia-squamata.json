    "intro": "Boerhavia squamata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with fleshy, succulent stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Boerhavia squamata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
