The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
