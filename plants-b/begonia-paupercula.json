    "intro": "Begonia paupercula, commonly known as the poor begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
