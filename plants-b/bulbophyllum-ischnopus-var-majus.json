    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ischnopus var. majus, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, spider-like flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive periods of drought. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
