It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Banffya has narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in mountainous regions."
