    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ngoyense, commonly known as the Ngoyi's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its bulbs, which are a defining feature of the genus, store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. The flowers usually bloom in shades of white, yellow, or green, and are often adorned with intricate patterns."
