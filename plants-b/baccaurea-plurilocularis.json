    "intro": "Baccaurea plurilocularis, commonly known as the many-seeded bocoa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. These fruits are typically red when ripe and contain several seeds enclosed in a gelatinous pulp. Baccaurea plurilocularis is often found in tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
