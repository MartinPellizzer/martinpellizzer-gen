    "intro": "Begonia subcostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety leaves with prominent, raised veins that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
