    "intro": "Begonia quadrialata subsp. dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, and often bi-colored leaves that display a combination of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
