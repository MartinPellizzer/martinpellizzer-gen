    "intro": "Bubonium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny bubon, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, often with a fuzzy texture. Bubonium spinosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
