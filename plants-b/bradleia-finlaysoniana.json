    "intro": "Bradleia finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's bradleia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
