It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
