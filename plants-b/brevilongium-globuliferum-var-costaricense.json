    "intro": "Brevilongium globuliferum var. costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican globular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of closely packed, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant produces small, globular sporophytes that are borne on short stalks, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and is adapted to humid tropical climates."
