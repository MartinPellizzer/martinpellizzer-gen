    "intro": "Bifaria khasiensis, commonly known as the Khasi bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of mountainous forests, thriving in cool and humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bifaria khasiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
