    "intro": "Bulbophyllum quadrangulare var. latisepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in photosynthesis. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or orange, are borne on terminal inflorescences and are often fragrant."
