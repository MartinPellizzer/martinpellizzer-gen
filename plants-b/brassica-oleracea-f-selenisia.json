    "intro": "Brassica oleracea f. selenisia, commonly known as the Romanesco cauliflower, is a unique cultivar characterized by its striking, fractal-like inflorescence. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is a variant of the common cabbage species. Its tightly packed, spiral-shaped florets are a result of genetic mutations that affect flower development. The plant typically grows to a height of 40\u201360 cm and produces edible, pale-green to cream-colored buds. It is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its mild, nutty flavor when cooked."
