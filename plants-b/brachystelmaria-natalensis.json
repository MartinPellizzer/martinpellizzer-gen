    "intro": "Brachystelmaria natalensis, commonly known as Natal's short-stemmed orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to South Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, preferring a sunny to partially shaded environment. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle violet hue. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, well-drained substrates it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
