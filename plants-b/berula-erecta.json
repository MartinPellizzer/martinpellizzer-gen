    "intro": "Berula erecta, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and arranged in dense clusters, producing small, oval fruits. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
