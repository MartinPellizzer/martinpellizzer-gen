    "intro": "Beilschmiedia sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane rainforests, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
