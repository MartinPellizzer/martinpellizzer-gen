    "intro": "Blepharistemma, commonly known as the eye-leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf shapes, often featuring lobes that resemble eyes, giving it its common name. The plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Blepharistemma species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of care."
