    "intro": "Baccharis floribundoides, commonly known as the Florida baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It is also a valuable food source for various insects and birds."
