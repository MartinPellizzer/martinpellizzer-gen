    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nocturnum, commonly known as the night orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that enhance their appeal to pollinators."
