    "intro": "Bassia fiedleri, commonly known as desert sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well-suited for sandy and rocky soils. Bassia fiedleri plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
