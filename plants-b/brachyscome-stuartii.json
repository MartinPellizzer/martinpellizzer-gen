    "intro": "Brachyscome stuartii, commonly known as Stuart's everlasting. It is a flowering plant native to Western Australia, characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and profuse display of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of yellow to orange disc florets, which are often retained on the plant after flowering, giving it a \"everlasting\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Brachyscome stuartii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
