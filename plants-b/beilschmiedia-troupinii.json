    "intro": "Beilschmiedia troupinii, commonly known as the Trinidadian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, waxy bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
