    "intro": "Benthamiella azorella, commonly known as the Azorean benthamiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Azores. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. This plant is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the humid, maritime climate of the Azores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
