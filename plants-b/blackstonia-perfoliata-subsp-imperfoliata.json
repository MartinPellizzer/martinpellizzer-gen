    "intro": "Blackstonia perfoliata subsp. imperfoliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackstonia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often appear to be clasping the stem, a feature that distinguishes it from its more common counterpart, B. perfoliata. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, often growing in association with other moisture-loving flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
