    "intro": "Begonia discrepans, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and pink hues. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
