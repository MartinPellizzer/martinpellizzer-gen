    "intro": "Byttneria amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
