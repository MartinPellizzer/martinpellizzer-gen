    "intro": "Bletia ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. Bletia ensiformis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
