It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, pink or purple flowers during the spring season. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as gravel plains and sandplains. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
