    "intro": "Brachyscome ciliaris var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bristlebur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments. Its fluffy appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control."
