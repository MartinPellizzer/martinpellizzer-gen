    "intro": "Banisteria obovata, commonly known as the red batik plant, is a climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and support itself on structures. Banisteria obovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
