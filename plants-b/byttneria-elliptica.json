    "intro": "Byttneria elliptica, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
