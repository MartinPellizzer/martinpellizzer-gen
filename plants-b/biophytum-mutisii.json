It belongs to the family Phytolacceae and is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, red or pink flowers. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.
