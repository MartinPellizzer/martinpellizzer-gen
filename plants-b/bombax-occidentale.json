    "intro": "Bombax occidentale, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the early dry season. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often shed seasonally, contributing to its deciduous nature. The bark is smooth and light gray, and the tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
