    "intro": "Balsamea caudata, commonly known as the trailing arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaf that often has a red or purple coloration along its veins. The plant produces a striking, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
