    "intro": "Berberis \u00d7 kewensis, commonly known as the Kew barberry, is a hybrid shrub resulting from the cross between Berberis julis and Berberis lycium. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, oval leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. Native to the British Isles, it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedging."
