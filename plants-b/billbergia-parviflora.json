    "intro": "Billbergia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia parviflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
