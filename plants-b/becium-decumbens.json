    "intro": "Becium decumbens, commonly known as the creeping becium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a low, sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Becium decumbens is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of its native habitat."
