    "intro": "Bryonia nitida, commonly known as the smooth bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features a trailing or ascending stem with tendrils that help it climb or spread across surfaces. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with five petals. The fruit is a spiny, orange-colored berry that contains toxic seeds, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested."
