    "intro": "Baccharis halimifolia, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces small, woody fruits called drupes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
