    "intro": "Bentleya spinescens, commonly known as the spiny bentleya, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
