    "intro": "Brassia longissima, commonly known as the long-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pendulous, fragrant flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in length. The flowers are typically white or pale pink with a yellow lip, and they bloom during the warmer months. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
