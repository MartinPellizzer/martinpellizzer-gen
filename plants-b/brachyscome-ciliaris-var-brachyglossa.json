It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a central yellow disc, blooming throughout the year in mild climates. The plant has finely divided, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
