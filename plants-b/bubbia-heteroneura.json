It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, elongated capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
