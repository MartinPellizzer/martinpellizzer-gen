It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet, marshy habitats. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments."
