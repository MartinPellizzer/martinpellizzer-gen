    "intro": "Bulbophyllum complanatum, commonly known as the flat-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flat, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum complanatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper conditions."
