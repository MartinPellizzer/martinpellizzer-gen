    "intro": "Bromus megapotamicus, commonly known as the Andean brome, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, and is often found in temperate to subtropical climates. Bromus megapotamicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
