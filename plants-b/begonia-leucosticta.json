    "intro": "Begonia leucosticta, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green veining. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia leucosticta is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
