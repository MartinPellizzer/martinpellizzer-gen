    "intro": "Bauhinia reticulata var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the crimson flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often tinged with red or pink hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil types, it is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
