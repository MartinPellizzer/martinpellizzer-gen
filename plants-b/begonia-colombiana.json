    "intro": "Begonia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to shades of red and purple. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
