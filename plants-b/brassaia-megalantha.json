    "intro": "Brassaia megalantha, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright orange-red flowers that resemble flames, making it a dramatic ornamental plant. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates with plenty of sunlight. It is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and can grow quite large, reaching up to 10 meters in length. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it requires careful management in garden settings."
