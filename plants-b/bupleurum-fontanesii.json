    "intro": "Bupleurum fontanesii, commonly known as the Alpine Bupleurum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
