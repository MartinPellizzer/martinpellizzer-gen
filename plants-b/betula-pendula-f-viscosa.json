    "intro": "Betula pendula f. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a variant of the silver birch characterized by its glandular hairs on the young shoots and leaves. This feature gives the plant a distinctive sticky texture, which is more pronounced in its juvenile stages. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that thrives in temperate climates, often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its bark is smooth and white when young, becoming fissured and darker with age."
