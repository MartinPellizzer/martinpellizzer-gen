    "intro": "Begonia grandibracteolata, commonly known as the giant bract begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
