    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum f. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, moon-shaped fronds that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
