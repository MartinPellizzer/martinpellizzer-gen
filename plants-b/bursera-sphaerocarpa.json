    "intro": "Bursera sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe curlleaf mohavea, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, woody fruit that resembles a small globe, which gives the plant its common name. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
