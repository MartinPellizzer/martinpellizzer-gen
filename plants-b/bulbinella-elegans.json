    "intro": "Bulbinella elegans, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that produces small, showy pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Bulbinella elegans plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
