    "intro": "Blechnum humile, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum humile is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, forested areas."
