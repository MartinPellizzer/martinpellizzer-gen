    "intro": "Blechnum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are usually bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
