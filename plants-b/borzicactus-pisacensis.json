    "intro": "Borzicactus pisacensis, commonly known as the Pisac cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the local flora."
