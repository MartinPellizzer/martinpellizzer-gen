    "intro": "Bromus caroli-henrici subsp. biaristulatus, commonly known as the Caroli-Henrici brome, is a grass species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
