    "intro": "Bistorta globispica, commonly known as the globe bistort, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky and barren ground. Bistorta globispica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas."
