    "intro": "Bulbophyllum saltatorium var. calamarium, commonly known as the sea hare orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, and often colorful pseudobulbs that resemble the shape of a sea hare, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, elongated flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good ventilation for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
