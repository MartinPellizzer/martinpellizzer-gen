    "intro": "Biscutella microcarpa f. carpohirta, commonly known as the hairy-fruited biscuitroot, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive, capsule-like fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
