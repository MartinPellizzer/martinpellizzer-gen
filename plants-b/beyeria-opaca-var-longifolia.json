    "intro": "Beyeria opaca var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its twigs. Its flowers are usually greenish-white, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to parts of Australia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
