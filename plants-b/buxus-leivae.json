    "intro": "Buxus leivae, commonly known as the Canary Islands boxwood, is a shrub native to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Buxus leivae thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
