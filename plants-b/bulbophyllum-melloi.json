    "intro": "Bulbophyllum melloi, commonly known as the Mello's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant features a slender stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
