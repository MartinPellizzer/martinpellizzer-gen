    "intro": "Betula chinensis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a compact, shrub-like form of the Chinese birch. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few feet in height, and its dense, rounded growth habit. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and light gray in color. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
