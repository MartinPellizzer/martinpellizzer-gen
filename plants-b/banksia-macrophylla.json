    "intro": "Banksia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant's leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, adapting to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Banksia macrophylla plays an important ecological role, providing nectar for a variety of pollinators, including honeyeaters and bees. Its resilience to fire and ability to regenerate from seed make it a key component of many Australian ecosystems."
