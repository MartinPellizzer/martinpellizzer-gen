    "intro": "Bromus pratensis var. simplex, commonly known as the simple meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each branch, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its simpler structure compared to other bromus species, with fewer branches and a more compact appearance."
