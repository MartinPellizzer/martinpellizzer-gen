    "intro": "Betula bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's birch, is a species of deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white to pale gray bark. The leaves are elliptical, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
