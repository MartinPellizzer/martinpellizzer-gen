    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. millefolium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble a cluster of tiny leaves, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium ternatum var. millefolium plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
