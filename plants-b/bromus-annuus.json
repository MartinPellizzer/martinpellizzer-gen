    "intro": "Bromus annuus, commonly known as annual brome, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in temperate climates. Bromus annuus is sometimes considered a weed but can play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
