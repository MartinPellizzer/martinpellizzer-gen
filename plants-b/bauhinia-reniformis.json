    "intro": "Bauhinia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney bean tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Bauhinia reniformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems."
