    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium f. gracile, commonly known as the slender nettle fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
