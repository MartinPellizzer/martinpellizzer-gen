    "intro": "Bashania qingchengshanensis, commonly known as Qingchengshan Bashania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Thaumatococcus, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and ecological adaptations. The plant is typically found in high-altitude regions with cool and moist climates, often in forested areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
