It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a mist-like appearance. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, while the flowers are borne in terminal or axillary clusters. Blumea fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
