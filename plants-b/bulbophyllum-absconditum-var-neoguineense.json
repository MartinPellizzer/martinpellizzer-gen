    "intro": "Bulbophyllum absconditum var. neoguineense, commonly known as the hidden bulbophyllum of New Guinea, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It possesses a compact growth habit with dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a challenging and rare species for cultivation."
