    "intro": "Batatas, commonly known as sweet potatoes, are tropical root vegetables belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. They are characterized by their rough, reddish-brown skin and sweet, moist flesh that varies in color from white to yellow, orange, or purple. Batatas thrive in warm climates and are typically grown in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. They are rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and essential vitamins such as A and C. The plant's tuberous roots are the primary edible part, while the leaves and vines are also used in some traditional cuisines."
