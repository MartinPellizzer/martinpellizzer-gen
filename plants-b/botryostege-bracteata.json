    "intro": "Botryostege bracteata, commonly known as the clustered bract fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by spherical, spore-bearing structures known as soruses. Botryostege bracteata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
