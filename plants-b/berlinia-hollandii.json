    "intro": "Berlinia hollandii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are odd-pinnate, with small, elliptical leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing several seeds. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
