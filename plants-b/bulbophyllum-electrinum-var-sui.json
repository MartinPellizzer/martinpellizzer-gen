    "intro": "Bulbophyllum electrinum var. sui, commonly known as the Sui's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, often growing on trees or rocks in the canopy. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
