It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid climate. The orchid's striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
