    "intro": "Barringtonia elongata, commonly known as the long-fruited flowering tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The tree produces a distinctive, elongated fruit that contains a single large seed surrounded by a fleshy, yellowish pulp. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
