    "intro": "Brachytome hirtellata, commonly known as the hairy brachytome, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine pubescence, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Brachytome hirtellata is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
