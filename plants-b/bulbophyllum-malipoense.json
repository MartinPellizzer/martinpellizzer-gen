    "intro": "Bulbophyllum malipoense, commonly known as the Malipo orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with periodic drought. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and yellow."
