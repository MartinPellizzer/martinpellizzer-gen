    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium subsp. rutifolium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spoon-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on specialized stalks called indusia, which are typically located near the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium matricariifolium subsp. rutifolium is a relatively small fern, typically growing to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters."
