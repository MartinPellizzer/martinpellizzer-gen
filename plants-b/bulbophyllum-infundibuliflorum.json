    "intro": "Bulbophyllum infundibuliflorum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. The botanical features of this orchid make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
