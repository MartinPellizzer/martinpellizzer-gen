    "intro": "Begonia mazae var. deminuta, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care in both indoor and outdoor settings."
