    "intro": "Boronia anemonifolia subsp. wadbilligensis, commonly known as the Wadbilligensis boronia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
