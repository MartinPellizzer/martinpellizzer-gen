It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that produces small, yellowish flowers and large, palmate leaves. The plant is valued for its seeds, which yield a rich source of natural oils used in cosmetics and traditional medicine. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role in both ecological systems and economic livelihoods in local communities."
