    "intro": "Blaeria viscosa, commonly known as the sticky blazer, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sticky resin, which gives it its common name, has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes. Blaeria viscosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
