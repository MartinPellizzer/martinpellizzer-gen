    "intro": "Betula rubra, commonly known as the red birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk that peels to reveal a lighter inner layer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, turning yellow in autumn before falling. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
