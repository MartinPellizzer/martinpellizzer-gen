It is a member of the genus Bryonia in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are lobed and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often trailing or climbing. Bryonia multiflora is characterized by its medicinal properties, though its berries are poisonous and should be handled with care."
