    "intro": "Berberis glomerata, commonly known as the clustered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and domestic animals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant red in the fall. Berberis glomerata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
