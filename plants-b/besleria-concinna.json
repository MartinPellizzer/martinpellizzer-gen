    "intro": "Besleria concinna, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Besleria concinna is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
