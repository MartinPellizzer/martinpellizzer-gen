    "intro": "Boerhavia diffusa var. undulata, commonly known as spreading hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with undulating edges that give it its species name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively. It is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in other moist environments."
