    "intro": "Buxus caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape and slightly pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its compact form and ability to be shaped into topiaries. Buxus caucasica prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings."
