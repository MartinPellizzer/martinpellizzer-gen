    "intro": "Bulbostylis ciliatifolia var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family. It is characterized by its narrow, ciliate (fringed) leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other varieties of Bulbostylis."
