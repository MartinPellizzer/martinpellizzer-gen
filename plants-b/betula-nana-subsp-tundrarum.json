It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often prostrate branches. The leaves are small, ovate, and deciduous, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is an important component of tundra vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various arctic organisms."
