    "intro": "Binaria kleiniana, commonly known as the Klein's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between June and September. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of old trees or in rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Binaria kleiniana is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
