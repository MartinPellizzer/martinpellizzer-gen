    "intro": "Bolbitis subcrenatoides, commonly known as the creeping hart's tongue fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural use."
