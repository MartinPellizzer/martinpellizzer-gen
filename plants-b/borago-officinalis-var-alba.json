    "intro": "[WRONG START] Borago officinalus var. alba, commonly known as white comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. While it has historical use in herbal medicine, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
