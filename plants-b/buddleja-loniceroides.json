    "intro": "Buddleja loniceroides, commonly known as the giant butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically medium green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces panicles of fragrant, nectar-rich flowers in shades of purple to pink, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Buddleja loniceroides thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is a popular choice for attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
