    "intro": "Bandeiraea speciosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which has been historically valued for its use in musical instruments and furniture. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the flowering season. The tree produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its propagation in its native habitat."
