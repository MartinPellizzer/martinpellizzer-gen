    "intro": "Bauhinia sericea, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are soft and silky to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its seeds are encased in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature. Bauhinia sericea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
