    "intro": "Begonia fischeri var. eufischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's begonia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep green color and a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
