    "intro": "Begonia micranthera var. venturii, commonly known as the Venturi's begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep green color and a distinctive, almost waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
