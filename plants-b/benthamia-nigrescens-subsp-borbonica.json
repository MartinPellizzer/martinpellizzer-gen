    "intro": "Benthamia nigrescens subsp. borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
