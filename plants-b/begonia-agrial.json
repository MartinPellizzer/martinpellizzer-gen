    "intro": "Begonia agrial, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety silver-green foliage with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pink, which are typically borne on short stalks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia agrial is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves and relatively low maintenance requirements."
