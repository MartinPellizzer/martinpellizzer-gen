    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. vestitus, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, awned flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
