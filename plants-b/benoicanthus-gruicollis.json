    "intro": "Benoicanthus gruicollis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment. Benoicanthus gruicollis is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
