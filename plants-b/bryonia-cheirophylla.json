It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with five petals. It bears orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a potentially hazardous plant. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
