It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. This orchid is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues.

Its bulbs, which are a distinguishing feature, help it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat."
