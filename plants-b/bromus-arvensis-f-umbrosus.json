    "intro": "Bromus arvensis f. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark bromegrass, is a variant of the common brome grass. It is characterized by its darker, often more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. This subspecies is typically found in shaded or moist environments, such as woodlands or disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually narrower and more elongated, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to low-light conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
