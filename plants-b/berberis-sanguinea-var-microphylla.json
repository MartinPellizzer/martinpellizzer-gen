It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often considered ornamental. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
