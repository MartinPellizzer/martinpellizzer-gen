    "intro": "Bubroma invira, commonly known as the slender burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Bubroma invira is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
