    "intro": "Begonia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
