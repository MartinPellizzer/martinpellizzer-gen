    "intro": "Bryopsis, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a genus of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on rocky substrates in marine environments. Bryopsis species typically grow in shallow coastal waters and are often found in tidal zones where they can absorb nutrients from the water. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a single layer of cells and lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
