It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky, arid environments at high altitudes. The plant has a cylindrical stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, and it produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native range."
