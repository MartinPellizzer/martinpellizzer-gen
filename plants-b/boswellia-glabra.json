    "intro": "Boswellia glabra, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is tapped from its bark and used in incense, perfumes, and traditional medicine. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable and often endangered species. Its leaves are alternate, leathery, and have a distinctive scent, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. The resin, known as olibanum, contains boswellic acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties."
