    "intro": "Bouteloua tenuis var. humilis, commonly known as blue grama grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to North America. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, drought-resistant turf. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
