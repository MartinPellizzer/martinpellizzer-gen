    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum subsp. robustum, commonly known as the robust sorrel fern, is a fern species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in small, rounded structures called sorghi. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Botrychium multifidum subsp. robustum is a perennial plant that plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
