    "intro": "Bragantia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bragantia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
