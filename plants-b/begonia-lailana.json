    "intro": "Begonia lailana, commonly known as the Malayan begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lailana is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
