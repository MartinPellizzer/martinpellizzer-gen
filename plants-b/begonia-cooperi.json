    "intro": "Begonia cooperi, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia cooperi is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
