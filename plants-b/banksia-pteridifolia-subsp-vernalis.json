    "intro": "Banksia pteridifolia subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its coastal habitat. It is typically found in heathlands and open forests, often growing in areas with good drainage. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is also cultivated for its ornamental appeal."
