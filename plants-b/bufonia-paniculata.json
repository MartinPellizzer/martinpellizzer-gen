    "intro": "Bufonia paniculata, commonly known as the panicle beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bufonia paniculata is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has hairy leaves and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
