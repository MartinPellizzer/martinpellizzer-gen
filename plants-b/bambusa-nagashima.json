    "intro": "Bambusa nagashima, commonly known as the Nagashima bamboo, is a species native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is a tall, clump-forming bamboo that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with slender, hollow stems that are often used in construction and crafts. The plant produces small, yellow-green inflorescences that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seeds. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a slightly wavy edge, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. Bambusa nagashima is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight."
