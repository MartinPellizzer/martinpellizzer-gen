    "intro": "Bignonia grandiflora rubra, commonly known as the red flame trumpetvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates."
