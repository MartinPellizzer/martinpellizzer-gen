    "intro": "Brassia helenae, commonly known as the Helen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically come in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Brassia helenae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
