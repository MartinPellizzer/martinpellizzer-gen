It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of the grass. Bromus kalmii var. porteri is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
