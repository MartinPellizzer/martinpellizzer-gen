    "intro": "Bromfeldia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, meaning it can be found growing on trees or rocks. Bromfeldia species have small, lance-shaped leaves and produce fragrant, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
