    "intro": "Bromus gyganteus, commonly known as the giant brome, is a tall perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stalks. It is adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil fertility. Bromus gyganteus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
