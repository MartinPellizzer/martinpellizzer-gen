    "intro": "Balanites aegyptiaca var. pallida, commonly known as the pale desert date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing a single large seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant is also valued for its hard wood and has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes."
