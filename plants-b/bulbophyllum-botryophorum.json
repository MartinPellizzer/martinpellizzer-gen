    "intro": "Bulbophyllum botryophorum, commonly known as the clustered pineapple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fleshy, greenish-yellow pseudobulbs. The plant typically blooms with fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in a spike-like structure. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
