It features wiry, hair-covered stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.
