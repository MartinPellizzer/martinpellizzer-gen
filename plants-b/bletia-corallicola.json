    "intro": "Bletia corallicola, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking coral-pink flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve water in its humid, low-light habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bletia corallicola is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
