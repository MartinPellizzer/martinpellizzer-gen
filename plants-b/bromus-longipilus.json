    "intro": "Bromus longipilus, commonly known as the long-haired brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open grasslands, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Bromus longipilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
