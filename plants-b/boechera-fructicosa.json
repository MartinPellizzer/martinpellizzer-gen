    "intro": "Boechera fructicosa, commonly known as the fruiting rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. Boechera fructicosa is also notable for its ability to produce fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
