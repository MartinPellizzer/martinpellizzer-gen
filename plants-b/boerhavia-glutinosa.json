    "intro": "Boerhavia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky blite, is an annual herbaceous plant native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, pale green, ovate leaves that are covered in a sticky substance. The flowers are typically pink to purple, borne in clusters at the leaf axils, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
