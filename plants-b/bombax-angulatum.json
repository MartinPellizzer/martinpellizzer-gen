    "intro": "Bombax angulatum, commonly known as the African silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
