    "intro": "Brachyramphus goraeensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos storm-petrel, is a small seabird native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its short, stubby bill and pale plumage, which helps it blend into its marine environment. The plant is not actually a botanical species but a bird, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. This confusion may arise from a misidentification or a mix-up with plant names. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name for clarification."
