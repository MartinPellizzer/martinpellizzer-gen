    "intro": "Biophytum sensitivum var. cumingianum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular choice for educational and ornamental purposes."
