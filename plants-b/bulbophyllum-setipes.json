    "intro": "Bulbophyllum setipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence typically bears multiple small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
