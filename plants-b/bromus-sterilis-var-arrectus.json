    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. arrectus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems."
