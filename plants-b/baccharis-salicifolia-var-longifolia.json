    "intro": "Baccharis salicifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as longleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, clustered yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
