    "intro": "Balanophora cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It is a fully mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant has a unique morphology, with a short, thick rhizome and fleshy, leaf-like structures that are not true leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and often have a faintly fragrant scent. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
