    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. megastachyus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
