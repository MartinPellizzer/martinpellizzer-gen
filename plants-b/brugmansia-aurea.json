It is characterized by its large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The flowers are typically white, yellow, or orange, and they emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially in the evening. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Brugmansia aurea is known for its rapid growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it is toxic and should be handled with care."
