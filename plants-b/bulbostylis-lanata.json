    "intro": "Bulbostylis lanata, commonly known as the hairy bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along water edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the wet season. Bulbostylis lanata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
