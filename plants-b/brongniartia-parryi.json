    "intro": "Brongniartia parryi, commonly known as the Parry's brongniartia, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves and conifer-like structure, which reflect its evolutionary link to early coniferous plants. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Brongniartia parryi is adapted to cold, arid environments, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
