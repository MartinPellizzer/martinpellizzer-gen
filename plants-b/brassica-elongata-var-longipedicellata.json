    "intro": "Brassica elongata var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-seed mustard, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, branched stems and small, green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by long, slender pods containing numerous tiny seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and potential as a wildflower, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
