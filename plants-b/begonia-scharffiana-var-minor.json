    "intro": "Begonia scharffiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care. Its varietal form, var. minor, is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the standard Begonia scharffiana."
