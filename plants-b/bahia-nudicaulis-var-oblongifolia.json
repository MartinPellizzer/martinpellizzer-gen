    "intro": "Bahia nudicaulis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bahia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy and disturbed soils, making it a common sight in coastal and open areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a useful plant for erosion control and landscaping."
