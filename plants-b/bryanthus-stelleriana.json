    "intro": "Bryanthus stelleriana, commonly known as the Steller's bryanthus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It is adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
