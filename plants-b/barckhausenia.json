It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in diverse habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. They have a fibrous root system and are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. Barckhausenia species are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
