It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a dense canopy with dark green, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Beilschmiedia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
