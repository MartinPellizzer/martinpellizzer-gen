    "intro": "Begonia lineata, commonly known as the zigzag begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that have a zigzag or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lineata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
