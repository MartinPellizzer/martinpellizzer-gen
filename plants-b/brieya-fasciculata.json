    "intro": "Brieya fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bristly broom, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to arid conditions. Brieya fasciculata is characterized by its compact growth form and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
