    "intro": "Belvala tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and produces bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Belvala tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
