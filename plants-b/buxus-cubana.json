    "intro": "Buxus cubana, commonly known as Cuban boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Cuba. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage consisting of small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Buxus cubana prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate pruning make it a popular choice for topiary and garden borders."
