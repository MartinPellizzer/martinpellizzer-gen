    "intro": "Bidens viciosoi, commonly known as the black beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and sticky, hairy leaves. The plant produces seeds with barbed structures that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
