    "intro": "Berghausia patula, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, where it forms dense clumps with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access moisture in arid mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
