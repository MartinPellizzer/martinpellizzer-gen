    "intro": "Bryonia jatrophifolia, commonly known as the Jerusalem thorn, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and spiny stems. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
