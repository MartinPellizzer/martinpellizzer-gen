    "intro": "Brassia transamazonica, commonly known as the Transamazonian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique botanical features include intricate floral structures and specialized root systems adapted to its humid, tropical environment. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
