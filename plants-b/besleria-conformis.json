    "intro": "Besleria conformis, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, dark green, zigzag-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
