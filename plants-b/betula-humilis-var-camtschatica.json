    "intro": "Betula humilis var. camtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open, rocky areas. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and hardiness in harsh environments."
