    "intro": "Bulbophyllum wangkaense, commonly known as the Wangka Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to store water, reflecting its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of Australian flora."
