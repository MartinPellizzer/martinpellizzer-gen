    "intro": "Baccharis marginalis, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various insects and birds. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
