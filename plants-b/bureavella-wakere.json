    "intro": "Bureavella wakere, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, evergreen shrub form with waxy, dark green leaves that are slightly serrated along the edges. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that intensifies at night. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Bureavella wakere is considered an endangered species."
