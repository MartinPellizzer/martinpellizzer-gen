It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with intricate, wavy edges that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
