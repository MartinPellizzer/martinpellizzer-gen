    "intro": "Bursa belgica, commonly known as the Belgian bur or the common bur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are encased in prickly burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Bursa belgica is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
