It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
