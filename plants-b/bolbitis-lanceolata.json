    "intro": "Bolbitis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Bolbitis lanceolata is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to oxygenate water."
