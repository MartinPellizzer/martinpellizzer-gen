    "intro": "Brassica sabularia var. psammophila, commonly known as sand cabbage, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions makes it an important component of pioneer vegetation in disturbed areas."
