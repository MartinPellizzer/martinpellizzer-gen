    "intro": "Biscutella didyma var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar biscutella, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its unique columnar growth habit, which sets it apart from other members of the genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
