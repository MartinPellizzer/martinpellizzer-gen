    "intro": "Begonia anamalayana, commonly known as the Anamalayana begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of India. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
