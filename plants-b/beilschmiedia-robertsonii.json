    "intro": "Beilschmiedia robertsonii, commonly known as the Robertson's beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and is often found in secondary forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
