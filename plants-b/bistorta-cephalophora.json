    "intro": "Bistorta cephalophora, commonly known as the nodding bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheat and sorrel, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features upright, somewhat zigzagging stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Bistorta cephalophora is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
