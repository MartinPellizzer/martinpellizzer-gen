    "intro": "Bulbophyllum schistopogon, commonly known as the stone-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, and its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. It has a complex root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is appreciated for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
