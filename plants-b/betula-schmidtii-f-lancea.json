    "intro": "Betula schmidtii f. lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the birch genus. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant is native to specific regions in East Asia, particularly in China and Korea, where it grows in temperate forest environments. Its bark is similar to other birches, featuring a white, peeling texture, but its foliage sets it apart. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
