    "intro": "Buettneria, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Buettneria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. They produce showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
