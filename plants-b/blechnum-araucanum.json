    "intro": "Blechnum araucanum, commonly known as the Andean maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
