    "intro": "Borzicactus serpens, commonly known as the snake-shaped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, ribbed stems that resemble the scales of a snake, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in a sprawling, low-lying form, with each segment being cylindrical and covered in small, white spines. It produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Borzicactus serpens is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in its harsh environment."
