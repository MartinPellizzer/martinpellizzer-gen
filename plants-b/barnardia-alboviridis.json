    "intro": "Barnardia alboviridis, commonly known as the white-veined bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a contrasting green throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, daisy-like blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
