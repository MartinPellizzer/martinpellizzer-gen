It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and large, compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody pods containing edible seeds. Its seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in hard shells and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
