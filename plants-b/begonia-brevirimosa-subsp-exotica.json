    "intro": "Begonia brevirimosa subsp. exotica, commonly known as the compact begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact growth habit, it is popular as a container plant and for rock garden displays."
