    "intro": "Boswellia samhaensis, commonly known as frankincense from the Socotra Islands, is a unique tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny foliage and pale yellow sap. The tree produces a resinous gum, which is harvested and used in traditional medicine and incense. Its ecological role is significant in the arid environments where it thrives, contributing to local biodiversity. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
