    "intro": "Biscutella segurae, commonly known as Segura's biscuitroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
