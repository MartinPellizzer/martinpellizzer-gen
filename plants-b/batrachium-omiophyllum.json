    "intro": "Batrachium omiophyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved frog's mouth, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are zygomorphic, meaning they are bilaterally symmetrical, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Batrachium omiophyllum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
