These plants are typically found in rocky or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Bolandra species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The leaves are usually grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. They are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
