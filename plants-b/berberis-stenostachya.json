    "intro": "Berberis stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stalked barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, which are dark green and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
