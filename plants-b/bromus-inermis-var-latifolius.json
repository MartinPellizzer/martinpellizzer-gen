    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its spread across various environments. This variety is characterized by its broad, flat leaves, distinguishing it from other bromus species."
