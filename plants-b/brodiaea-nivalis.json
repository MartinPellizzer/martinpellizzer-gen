It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. Brodiaea nivalis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-elevation environments."
