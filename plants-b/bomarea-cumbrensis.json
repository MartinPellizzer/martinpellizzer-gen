    "intro": "Bomarea cumbrensis, commonly known as the Cumbrian bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bomarea cumbrensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
