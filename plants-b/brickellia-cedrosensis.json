    "intro": "Brickellia cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the rocky shores of Cedros Island in the Gulf of California. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
