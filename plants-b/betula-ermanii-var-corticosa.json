    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. corticosa, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variety is closely related to other birch species but is distinguished by its unique bark texture and growth habits."
