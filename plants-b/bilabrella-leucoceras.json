It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in wet environments. The white-capped bilabrella plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
