    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. nova-macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant pineapple bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, waxy, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears clusters of small, fragrant flowers, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common in epiphytic bromeliads. The plant is native to the humid rainforests of South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
