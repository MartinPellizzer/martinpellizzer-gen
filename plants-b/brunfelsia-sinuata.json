    "intro": "Brunfelsia sinuata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces striking, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions."
