    "intro": "Bouteloua dimorpha, commonly known as grayblue grama, is a native grass species found in the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities. Bouteloua dimorpha plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
