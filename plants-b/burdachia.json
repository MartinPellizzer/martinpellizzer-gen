    "intro": "Burdachia, commonly known as the \"false burdock,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Burdachia species typically have hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. They produce small, bract-like structures that enclose the flowers, which are pollinated by insects. The genus includes several species, such as Burdachia heterophylla, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
