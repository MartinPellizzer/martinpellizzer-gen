    "intro": "Begonia suborbiculata, commonly known as the rounded-leaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
