    "intro": "Botrychium alabamense, commonly known as the Alabama moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, erect, spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is typically found on the underside of its fronds. The plant has a distinctive, narrow, and often curling frond that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodlands or along stream banks. Botrychium alabamense is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Alabama and adjacent regions."
