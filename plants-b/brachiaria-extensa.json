    "intro": "Brachiaria extensa, commonly known as Brazilian grass or horse grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Brachiaria extensa is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its vigorous growth and resilience."
