It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, reddish-brown leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
