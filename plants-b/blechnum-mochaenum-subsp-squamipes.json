    "intro": "Blechnum mochaenum subsp. squamipes, commonly known as the Mocha fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
