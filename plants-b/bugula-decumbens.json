    "intro": "Bugula decumbens, commonly known as the fluted sponge or fluted bugula, is a species of bryozoan that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its branching, coral-like structure composed of calcareous or chitinous exoskeletons. The organism forms colonies that can be either erect or sprawling, depending on environmental conditions. It is typically found attached to rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. Bugula decumbens plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to reef biodiversity."
