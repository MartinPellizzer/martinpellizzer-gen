    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, which helps it survive in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native range."
