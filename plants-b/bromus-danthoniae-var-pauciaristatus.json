    "intro": "Bromus danthoniae var. pauciaristatus, commonly known as the sparse-awned brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, with the distinctive feature of having few awns on the lemma. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and habitat restoration efforts."
