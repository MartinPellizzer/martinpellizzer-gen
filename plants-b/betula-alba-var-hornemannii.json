It is characterized by its unique bark patterns, which feature a combination of white and black markings. The tree has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions of Europe."
