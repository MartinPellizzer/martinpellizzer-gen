    "intro": "Brickellia oligadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia oligadenia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
