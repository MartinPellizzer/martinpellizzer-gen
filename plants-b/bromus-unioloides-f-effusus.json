    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. effusus, commonly known as the soft bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are typically curled at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. This form is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in disturbed environments."
