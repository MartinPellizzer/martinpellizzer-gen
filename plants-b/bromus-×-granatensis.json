    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 granatensis, commonly known as the granatense brome, is a hybrid grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
