    "intro": "Buglossoides gastonii, commonly known as the Arizona bugloss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and produces showy blue to violet flowers in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and open grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. The Arizona bugloss is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
