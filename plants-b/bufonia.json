    "intro": "Bufonia, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers, which attract pollinators. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, making it potentially harmful to the skin when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
