    "intro": "Begonia nagaensis, commonly known as the Naga begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
