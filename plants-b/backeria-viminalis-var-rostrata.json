    "intro": "Backeria viminalis var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, blooming in early summer. The species is notable for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations."
