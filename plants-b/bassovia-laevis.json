    "intro": "Bassovia laevis, commonly known as the smooth basswood, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Bassovia laevis is valued for its hard, fine-grained wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
