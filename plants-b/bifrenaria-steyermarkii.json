    "intro": "Bifrenaria steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's bifrenaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as montane forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive two-lobed structure, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
