    "intro": "Bashania victorialis, commonly known as the Victor's bashania, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bashania victorialis is considered a vulnerable species."
