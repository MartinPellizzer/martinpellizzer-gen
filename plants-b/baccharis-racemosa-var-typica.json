    "intro": "Baccharis racemosa var. typica, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and showy, fluffy white to yellow flower heads that appear in late summer to early fall. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to salt spray, making it a hardy component of coastal ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
