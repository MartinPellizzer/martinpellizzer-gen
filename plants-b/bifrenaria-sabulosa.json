    "intro": "Bifrenaria sabulosa, commonly known as the sandstone fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often growing on rocky slopes or in sandy habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Bifrenaria sabulosa is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments."
