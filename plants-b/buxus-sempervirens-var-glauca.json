    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. glauca, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is often covered with a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy and ornamental qualities. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. This variety is prized for its slow growth and ability to maintain a compact shape, making it a popular choice for topiary and formal garden designs."
