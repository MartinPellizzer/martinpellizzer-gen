    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris f. lycium, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a variant of the barberry plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine. The f. lycium form is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth pattern compared to the typical Berberis vulgaris."
