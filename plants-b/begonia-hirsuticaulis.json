    "intro": "Begonia hirsuticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden beds."
