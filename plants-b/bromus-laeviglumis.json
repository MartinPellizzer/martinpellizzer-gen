    "intro": "Bromus laeviglumis, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense tussocks, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth upper surface. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three flowering glumes. Its seeds are small, oval, and have a distinctive smooth texture, contributing to its adaptability in various soil types. Bromus laeviglumis is often used in pastureland and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
