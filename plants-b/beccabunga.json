    "intro": "Beccabunga, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has delicate, floating leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Beccabunga thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often used in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
