    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. parva-praecox, commonly known as the wild cabbage or early cabbage, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and small, cabbage-like heads that form in the second year. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is a hardy species that can tolerate cooler temperatures and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This subspecies is considered an ancestor of several cultivated brassicas, including cabbage and kale."
