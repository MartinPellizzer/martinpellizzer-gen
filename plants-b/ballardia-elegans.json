    "intro": "Ballardia elegans, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ballardia elegans is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance and stinging hairs."
