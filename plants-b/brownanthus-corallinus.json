    "intro": "Brownanthus corallinus, commonly known as the coral bush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking coral-pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Brownanthus corallinus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune systems along the Atlantic coast."
