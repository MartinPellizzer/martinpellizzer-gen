    "intro": "Begonia acutis, commonly known as the sharp-leaved begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
