    "intro": "Borreria tenella var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Borreria tenella var. angustifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
