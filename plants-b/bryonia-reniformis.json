    "intro": "Bryonia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are thick and tuberous. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its medicinal compounds."
