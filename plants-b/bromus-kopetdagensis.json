    "intro": "Bromus kopetdagensis, commonly known as Kopetdagen grass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus kopetdagensis plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies."
