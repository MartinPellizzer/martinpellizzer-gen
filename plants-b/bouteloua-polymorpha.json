    "intro": "Bouteloua polymorpha, commonly known as blue grama, is a grass species native to the central and western United States. It is a perennial plant characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil. Blue grama is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in restoration projects."
