    "intro": "Barya monadelpha, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and woody stems. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Barya monadelpha is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
