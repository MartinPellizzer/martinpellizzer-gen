    "intro": "Barbarea barbarea var. stricta, commonly known as the upright winter cress, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its seeds are small, oblong, and often dispersed by wind or water. This variety is distinguished by its upright growth habit, contrasting with the more sprawling form of the typical B. barbarea."
