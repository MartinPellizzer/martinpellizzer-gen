It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is herbaceous, with slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers typically appear in late summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, contributing to its common occurrence in open habitats."
