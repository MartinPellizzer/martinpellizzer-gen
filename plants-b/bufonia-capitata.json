    "intro": "Bufonia capitata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its bright yellow to orange berries that are highly visible against the green foliage. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. It produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. Bufonia capitata is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it forms symbiotic relationships with its host trees."
