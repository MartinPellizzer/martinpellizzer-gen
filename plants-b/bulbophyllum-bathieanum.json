    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bathieanum, commonly known as the Bathiean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the summer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
