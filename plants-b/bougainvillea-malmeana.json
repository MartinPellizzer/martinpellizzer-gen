    "intro": "Bougainvillea malmeana, commonly known as the Malme's paperflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and white, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers inside the bracts, which are typically white or yellow. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Bougainvillea malmeana is known for its ability to grow on trellises or as a shrub, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
