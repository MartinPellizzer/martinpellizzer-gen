    "intro": "Baccharoides lilacina, commonly known as the lilac baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, pinkish to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Baccharoides lilacina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
