    "intro": "Buddleja vetula, commonly known as the European butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Buddleja vetula is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
