    "intro": "Bartsia decurva, commonly known as the slender bartsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Bartsia decurva has a fibrous root system and spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
