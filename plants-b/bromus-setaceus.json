    "intro": "Bromus setaceus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Bromus setaceus is relatively drought-tolerant and has a moderate growth rate, making it a common species in temperate climates."
