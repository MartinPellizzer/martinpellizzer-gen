    "intro": "Bellevalia fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces striking violet-blue flowers in early summer. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive two-lipped structure, typical of the Campanulaceae family. Bellevalia fuliginosa is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
