It is characterized by its distinct reddish hue in the flower heads, which sets it apart from the typical green or golden varieties. This form thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and landscaping purposes. The plant also plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
