    "intro": "Basanacantha calycina, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and vibrant purple petals that resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Basanacantha calycina is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
