It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for arid environments."
