    "intro": "Bouteloua curtipendula, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, drooping seed heads that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize and persist in various environments. Bouteloua curtipendula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
