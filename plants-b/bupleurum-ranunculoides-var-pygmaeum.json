    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth habits, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
