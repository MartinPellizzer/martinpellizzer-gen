    "intro": "Blechnum wardiae, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile shoots. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching appearance. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
