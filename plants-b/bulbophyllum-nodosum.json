    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nodosum, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, nodding flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The orchid produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
