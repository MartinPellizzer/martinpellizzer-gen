    "intro": "Bolbitis occidentalis, commonly known as the western shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread and establish new growth. Bolbitis occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
