    "intro": "Buxus argentea, commonly known as silver boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with silvery-white undersides that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form neat, sculptural shapes."
