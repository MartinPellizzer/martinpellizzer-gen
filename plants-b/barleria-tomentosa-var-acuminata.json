It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
