    "intro": "Bambusa vulgaris f. waminii, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a clumping bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow to orange-colored culms, which provide a vibrant contrast to its green leaves. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the nodes. It grows in dense clusters and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. This bamboo is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
