    "intro": "Busbeckea arborea, commonly known as the tree hakea, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces striking, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it exhibits a high degree of drought tolerance. Busbeckea arborea is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
