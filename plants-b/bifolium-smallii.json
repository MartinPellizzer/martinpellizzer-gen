    "intro": "Bifolium smallii, commonly known as the small's two-leaf plant, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bifolium smallii is considered a vulnerable species."
