    "intro": "Botrychium simplex subsp. simplex, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a unique reproductive strategy, with the sporangia developing directly on the leaf surfaces rather than in specialized structures. Botrychium simplex subsp. simplex is often found in temperate regions and is known for its delicate, pale green foliage."
