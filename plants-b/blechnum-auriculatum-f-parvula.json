    "intro": "Blechnum auriculatum f. parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The fronds are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Blechnum auriculatum, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) shape at the base of the pinnae. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
