It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike with short, compact spikelets. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, distinguishing it from other members of the Bromus genus."
