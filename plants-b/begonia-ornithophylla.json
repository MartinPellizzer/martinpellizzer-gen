    "intro": "Begonia ornithophylla, commonly known as the birdwing begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, with a unique bird-like shape that inspired its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
