    "intro": "Brodiaea lutea var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-leaved brodiaea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish flowers and rough, hairy foliage, which give it its scientific name \"scabra,\" meaning rough in Latin. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is part of the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
