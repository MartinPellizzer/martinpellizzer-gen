    "intro": "Banksia nobilis subsp. fragrans, commonly known as the sweet banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces a unique, sweet-smelling nectar that attracts a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This subspecies is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is an important component of the local flora."
