    "intro": "Bidens setigera subsp. bipinnatopartita, commonly known as the bipinnate beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are deeply divided into small, thread-like segments. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent white markings, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands. Its seeds are dispersed by attachment to animals or clothing, a feature that contributes to its widespread distribution."
