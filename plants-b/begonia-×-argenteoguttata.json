    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 argenteoguttata, commonly known as the silver-spotted begonia, is a hybrid plant prized for its ornamental value. It features striking foliage with silver and green mottling, which adds visual interest to gardens or indoor spaces. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for containers, hanging baskets, or as a border plant."
