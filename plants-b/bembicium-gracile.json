    "intro": "Bembicium gracile, commonly known as the slender bembicium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its wetland habitat. Bembicium gracile is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
