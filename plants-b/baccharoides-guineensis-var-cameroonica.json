It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.
