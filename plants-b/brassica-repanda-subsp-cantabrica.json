    "intro": "Brassica repanda subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian Brassica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and rocky outcrops. The plant features a rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and environmental changes."
