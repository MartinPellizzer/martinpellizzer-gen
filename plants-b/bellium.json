    "intro": "Bellium, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of about 30 species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or linear, and they produce small, bright yellow or white flowers in racemes. Bellium species often grow in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
