    "intro": "Bulbophyllum eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
