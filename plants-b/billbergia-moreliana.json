    "intro": "Billbergia moreliana, commonly known as the pink bottlebrush. It is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil, characterized by its vibrant pink bracts that surround a central spadix. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with the showy bracts serving as the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
