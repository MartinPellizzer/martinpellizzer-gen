    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ochrochlamys, commonly known as the golden-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture. The orchid thrives in shaded, humid conditions and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild."
