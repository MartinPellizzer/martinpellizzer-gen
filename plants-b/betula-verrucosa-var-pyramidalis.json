    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive conical shape and smooth, white bark. It is native to the northern regions of North America and thrives in cold climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark, which peels in thin, papery layers, is a key identifying feature and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes. This deciduous tree is often found in boreal forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
