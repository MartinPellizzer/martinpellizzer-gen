    "intro": "Batschia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Batschia thrives in hot, dry climates and has adapted to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
