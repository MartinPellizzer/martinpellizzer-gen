    "intro": "Brachystele atramentaria, commonly known as the black-stemmed moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish stems and tightly packed, cushion-like growth form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in forest understories. Its leaves are short and narrow, with a smooth or slightly rough surface. Brachystele atramentaria is notable for its ability to retain water and survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
