It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous flowers that hang in clusters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and hanging baskets. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
