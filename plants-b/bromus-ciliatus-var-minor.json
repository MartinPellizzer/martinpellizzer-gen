    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with hairy leaves that are often curled at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
