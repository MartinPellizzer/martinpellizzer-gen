It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and along streams, contributing to local biodiversity."
