    "intro": "Bromus attenuatus, commonly known as slender brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Bromus attenuatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
