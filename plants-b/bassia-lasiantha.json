    "intro": "Bassia lasiantha, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly curled margin, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Bassia lasiantha is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open plains."
