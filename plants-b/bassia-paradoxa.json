    "intro": "Bassia paradoxa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
