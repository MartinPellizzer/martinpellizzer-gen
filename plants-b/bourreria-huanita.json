The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation."
