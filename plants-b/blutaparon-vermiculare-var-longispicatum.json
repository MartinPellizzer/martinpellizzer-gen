    "intro": "Blutaparon vermiculare var. longispicatum, commonly known as the long-spined vermiculare, is a distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces unique, elongated bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is notable for its spiny structures, which provide both a defensive mechanism and a distinguishing feature."
