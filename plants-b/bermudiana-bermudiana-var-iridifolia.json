    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana var. iridifolia, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, low-growing habit that forms a thick sod. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common ornamental and turfgrass in warm climates. Its ability to spread through stolons and rhizomes allows it to form extensive mats, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
