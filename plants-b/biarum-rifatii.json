    "intro": "Biarum rifatii, commonly known as the Rif Valley bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa, it is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Biarum rifatii is considered a rare and endangered species."
