    "intro": "Botrydium aromaticum, commonly known as the fragrant liverwort, is a type of moss belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically clustered in small, stalked clusters on the leafy shoots. Botrydium aromaticum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its aromatic properties are attributed to the presence of volatile compounds in its tissues."
