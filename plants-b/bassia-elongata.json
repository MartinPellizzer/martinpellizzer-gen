    "intro": "Bassia elongata, commonly known as jointed grass or prairie sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in prairie and steppe habitats. The plant has slender, jointed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Bassia elongata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
