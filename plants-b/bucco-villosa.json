    "intro": "Bucco villosa, commonly known as the woolly bucco, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, or villosa, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
