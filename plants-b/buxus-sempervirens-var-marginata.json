    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. marginata, commonly known as the silver-edged boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with distinctive white or silver margins on the leaf edges. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for topiary and formal garden designs. Its slow growth rate allows for precise shaping, and it prefers well-drained soil in full to partial sunlight. The leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in garden settings."
