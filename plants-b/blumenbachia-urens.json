    "intro": "Blumenbachia urens, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called vesicles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These vesicles are inflated with air, allowing the plant to float and attract prey. Blumenbachia urens is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, where it supplements its nutrient intake through carnivory."
