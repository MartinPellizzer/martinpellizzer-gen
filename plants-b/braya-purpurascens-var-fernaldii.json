    "intro": "Braya purpurascens var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's cushion-brake, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in tight clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of B. purpurascens."
