    "intro": "Baccharis pluridentata, commonly known as whitebrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and showy clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as plains and rocky slopes. Its aromatic leaves and branches have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. Baccharis pluridentata is also valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
