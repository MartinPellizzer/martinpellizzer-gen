    "intro": "Blechnum vittatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, overlapping segments resembling a feather. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and silvery-white on the underside, giving it its common name. Blechnum vittatum is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
