    "intro": "Borreria lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy leaf borreria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Borreria lasiocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
