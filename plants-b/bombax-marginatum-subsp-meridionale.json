    "intro": "Bombax marginatum subsp. meridionale, commonly known as the red cotton tree or ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters and are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a fibrous capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It has a buttressed trunk and can grow quite tall, making it a prominent feature in its native habitat. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its adaptability in humid environments."
