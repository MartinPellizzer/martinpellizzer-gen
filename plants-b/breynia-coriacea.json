    "intro": "Breynia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Breynia coriacea is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
