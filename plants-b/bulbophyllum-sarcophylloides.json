    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sarcophylloides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive veined structure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
