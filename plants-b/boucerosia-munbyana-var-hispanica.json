    "intro": "Boucerosia munbyana var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish boucerosia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
