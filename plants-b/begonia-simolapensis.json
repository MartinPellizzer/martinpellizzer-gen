    "intro": "Begonia simolapensis, commonly known as the Malawi begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in horticulture, although it remains relatively uncommon in the global trade."
