    "intro": "Brassia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It features showy, pendulous flowers that are typically pink or purple with yellow markings, and it blooms during the warmer months. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water, adapting to its humid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Brassia ecuadorensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
