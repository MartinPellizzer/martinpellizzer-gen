    "intro": "Batrachium circinatum subsp. fucoides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America. It is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae, characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The subspecies fucoides is particularly adapted to saline and sandy environments, often growing in dunes or on rocky shores. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
