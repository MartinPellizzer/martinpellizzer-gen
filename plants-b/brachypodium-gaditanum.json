    "intro": "Brachypodium gaditanum, commonly known as the Iberian false brome, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Brachypodium gaditanum is adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
