    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. dumosum, commonly known as the tufted false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of temperate forest ecosystems."
