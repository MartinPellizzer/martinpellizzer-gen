It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Becium ternatum is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
