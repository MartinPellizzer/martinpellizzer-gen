    "intro": "Brachyris ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are ovate and slightly narrowed at the base, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Brachyris ovatifolia is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
