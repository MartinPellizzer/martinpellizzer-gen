    "intro": "Breynia hyposauropus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of resinous exudate, which provides protection against herbivores and extreme weather. Breynia hyposauropus is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water."
