    "intro": "Botrychium breynii, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium breynii is a perennial plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction."
