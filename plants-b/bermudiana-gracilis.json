    "intro": "Bermudiana gracilis, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing in dunes and along the shoreline, where it helps stabilize the sand. Bermudiana gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in coastal ecosystems."
