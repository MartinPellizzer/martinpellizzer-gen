    "intro": "Blechnum vulcanicum var. lobatum, commonly known as the lobate holly fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of pale, fuzzy hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
