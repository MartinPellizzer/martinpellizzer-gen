It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and squash. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has tendrils that help it climb and support its growth. Its fruits are typically green and turn orange or red when mature, containing toxic seeds. Due to its poisonous nature, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution when handling."
