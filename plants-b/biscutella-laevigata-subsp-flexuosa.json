    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
