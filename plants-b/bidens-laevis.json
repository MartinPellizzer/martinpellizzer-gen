    "intro": "Bidens laevis, commonly known as the smooth beggar-ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It features slender, branching stems and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Bidens laevis is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in many regions."
