    "intro": "Billbergia chlorantha, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. It produces striking purple flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. Billbergia chlorantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture."
