    "intro": "Betula kelleriana, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Betula kelleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
