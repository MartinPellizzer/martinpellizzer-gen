    "intro": "Bellevalia battandieri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
