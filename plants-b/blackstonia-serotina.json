    "intro": "Blackstonia serotina, commonly known as the late blackstonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Blackstonia serotina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
