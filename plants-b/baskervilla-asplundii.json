It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
