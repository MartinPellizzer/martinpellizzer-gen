    "intro": "Blechnum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curved and slightly notched at the tips."
