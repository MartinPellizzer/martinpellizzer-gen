    "intro": "Baumea ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf baumea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Baumea ensifolia is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
