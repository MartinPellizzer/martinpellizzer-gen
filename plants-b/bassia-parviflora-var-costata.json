    "intro": "Bassia parviflora var. costata, commonly known as the wrinkled sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny bracts that enclose its tiny yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are enclosed in a spiny capsule, aiding in its propagation in sandy or disturbed soils. This plant is often found in grasslands, dunes, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
