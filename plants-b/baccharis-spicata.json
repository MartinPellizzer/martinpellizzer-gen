    "intro": "Baccharis spicata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Baccharis spicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
