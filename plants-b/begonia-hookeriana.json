    "intro": "Begonia hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
