    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its environment. Bulbophyllum nepalense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
