It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, white to greenish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps each. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Bunium denudatum is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
