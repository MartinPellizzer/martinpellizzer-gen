    "intro": "Bothriochloa saccharoides subsp. parvispicula, commonly known as dwarf sugar grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
