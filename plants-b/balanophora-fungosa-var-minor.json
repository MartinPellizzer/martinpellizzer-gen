    "intro": "Balanophora fungosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with a unique, intricate structure typical of orchids. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide essential carbohydrates. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes."
