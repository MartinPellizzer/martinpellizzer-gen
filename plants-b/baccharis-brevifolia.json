    "intro": "Baccharis brevifolia, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Baccharis brevifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
