    "intro": "Bicornella glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bicornella, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often glandular and hairy, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Bicornella glandulosa is noted for its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle yet distinctive presence to its habitat."
