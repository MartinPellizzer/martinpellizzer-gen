It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plants typically grow as annuals or perennials, depending on the species and climate. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. Brassiopsis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
