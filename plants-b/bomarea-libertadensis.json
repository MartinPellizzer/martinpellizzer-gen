    "intro": "Bomarea libertadensis, commonly known as the Libertador's bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bomarea libertadensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
