    "intro": "Bumelia undulata, commonly known as the zigzag gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Bumelia undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
