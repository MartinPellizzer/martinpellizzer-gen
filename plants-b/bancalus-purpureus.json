    "intro": "Bancalus purpureus, commonly known as the purple longhorned beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its striking purple coloration and elongated body, which can reach up to 3 centimeters in length. The plant it interacts with is primarily the sapling of the genus *Celtis*, commonly known as hackberry. Its larvae feed on the wood of these trees, contributing to the natural decomposition process. This beetle plays a role in forest ecosystems by aiding in the breakdown of dead wood and recycling nutrients."
