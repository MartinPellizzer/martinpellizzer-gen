    "intro": "Barringtonia insignis, commonly known as the white cedar or mountain cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hairy seeds. The plant is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit make it an important species for pollinators like moths."
