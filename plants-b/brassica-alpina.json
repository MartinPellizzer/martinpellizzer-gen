    "intro": "Brassica alpina, commonly known as the alpine cabbage, is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, typically growing in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its rosette of dark green, waxy leaves and small white or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Brassica alpina is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
