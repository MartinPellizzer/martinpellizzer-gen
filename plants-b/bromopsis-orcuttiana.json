    "intro": "Bromopsis orcuttiana, commonly known as the Orcutt's bromus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromopsis orcuttiana is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
