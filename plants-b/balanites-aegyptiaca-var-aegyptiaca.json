    "intro": "Balanites aegyptiaca var. aegyptiaca, commonly known as the desert date or Egyptian date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a thick, gnarled trunk with a rough, fissured bark that provides protection against drought and fire. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that give way to hard, woody fruits containing sweet, edible seeds. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
