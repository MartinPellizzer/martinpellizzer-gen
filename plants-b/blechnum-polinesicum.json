    "intro": "Blechnum polinesicum, commonly known as the Polynesian holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, stiff texture that distinguishes it from other fern species."
