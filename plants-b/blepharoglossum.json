    "intro": "Blepharoglossum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rock crevices. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive structure that aids in their identification. Blepharoglossum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
