    "intro": "Bulbophyllum annamense, commonly known as the Annam orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and adaptability make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
