    "intro": "Brunia thyrsophora, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in rounded, branched clusters called thyrses. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Brunia thyrsophora is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appeal."
