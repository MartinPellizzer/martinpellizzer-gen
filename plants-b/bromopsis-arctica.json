    "intro": "Bromopsis arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Bromopsis arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
