    "intro": "Bignonia tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slender trumpetvine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its long, slender tendrils allow it to climb and spread along structures or trees. Bignonia tenuisiliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
