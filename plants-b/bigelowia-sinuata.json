    "intro": "Bigelowia sinuata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Bigelowia sinuata is often found in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates."
