    "intro": "Baccaurea minahassae, commonly known as the Minahassa baccaurea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Indonesia, particularly the islands of Sulawesi and neighboring regions. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, ovate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. Its fruits are small, spherical berries that contain a single seed, and the plant is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
