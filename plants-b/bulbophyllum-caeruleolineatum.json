    "intro": "Bulbophyllum caeruleolineatum, commonly known as the blue-lined orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-green pseudobulbs and linear, often hairy leaves. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive blue-violet coloration, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
