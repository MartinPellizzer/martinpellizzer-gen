    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is known for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated in gardens. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
