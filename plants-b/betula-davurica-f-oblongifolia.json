    "intro": "Betula davurica f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf birch, is a variant of the Davurian birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in cold, dry climates and is adapted to high altitudes. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
