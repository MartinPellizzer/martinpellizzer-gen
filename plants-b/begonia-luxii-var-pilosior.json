    "intro": "Begonia luxii var. pilosior, commonly known as the velvety begonia, is a striking hybrid plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
