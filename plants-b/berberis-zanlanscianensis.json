It features spiny, thorned stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
