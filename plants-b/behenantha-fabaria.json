    "intro": "Behenantha fabaria, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological systems."
