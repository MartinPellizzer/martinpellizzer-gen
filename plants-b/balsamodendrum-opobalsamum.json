It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its vibrant floral display."
