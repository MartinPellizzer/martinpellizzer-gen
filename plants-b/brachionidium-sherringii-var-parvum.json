    "intro": "Brachionidium sherringii var. parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered brachionidium, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered inflorescences and finely divided leaves, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
