    "intro": "Biscutella ciliata var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar biscutella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which gives it its common name. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
