    "intro": "Biasolettia montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegrin biasolettia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Montenegro. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged spirally along the stems, while its cones are small and woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
