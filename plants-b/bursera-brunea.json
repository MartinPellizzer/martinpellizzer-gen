    "intro": "Bursera brunea, commonly known as the \"Copaiba tree,\" is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The tree has a rounded crown, smooth gray bark, and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant is valued for its resin, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and aromatic applications."
