    "intro": "Bouchea pumila var. subcanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
