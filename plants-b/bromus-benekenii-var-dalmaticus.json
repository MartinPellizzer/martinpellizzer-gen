    "intro": "Bromus benekenii var. dalmaticus, commonly known as the Dalmatian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
