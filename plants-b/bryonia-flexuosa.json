    "intro": "Bryonia flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, often found in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow, cucumber-like flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are lobed and can be mistaken for those of other nightshade plants. Bryonia flexuosa is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia."
