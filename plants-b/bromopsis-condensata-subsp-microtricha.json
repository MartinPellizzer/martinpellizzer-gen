    "intro": "Bromopsis condensata subsp. microtricha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulblet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are borne in tight clusters, and it produces bulbils for vegetative propagation. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely textured leaves and compact growth habit."
