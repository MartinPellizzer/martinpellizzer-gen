    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra var. sanderiana, commonly known as the pink sanders bougainvillea, is a popular flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that range from pale pink to deep magenta, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a trailing or shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems that can be trained into shapes. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping and as a container plant."
