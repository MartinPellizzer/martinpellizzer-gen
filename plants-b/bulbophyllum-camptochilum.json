    "intro": "Bulbophyllum camptochilum, commonly known as the twisted-lip orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with distinctive, twisted lip petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical collections and horticultural enthusiasts."
