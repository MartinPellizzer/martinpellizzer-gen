    "intro": "Blechnopsis pectinata, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the spore-bearing fronds in the second."
