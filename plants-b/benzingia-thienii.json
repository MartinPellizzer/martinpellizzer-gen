    "intro": "Benzingia thienii, commonly known as the Thien's bracken, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
