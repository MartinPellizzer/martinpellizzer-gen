    "intro": "Blechnum lomariaceum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
