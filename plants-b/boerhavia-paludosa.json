    "intro": "Boerhavia paludosa, commonly known as swamp bluemink, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a herbaceous annual that grows in marshy areas, often in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant has small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. It has a shallow root system adapted to waterlogged conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Boerhavia paludosa is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
