    "intro": "Bernardina pentapetala, commonly known as the five-petaled bellflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Andes. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five distinct petals. The plant grows in rocky, high-altitude environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardina pentapetala is considered a vulnerable species."
