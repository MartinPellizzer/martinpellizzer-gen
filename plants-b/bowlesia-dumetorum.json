    "intro": "Bowlesia dumetorum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Bowlesia dumetorum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
