These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Boutonia species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, often with opposite, lance-shaped leaves.
