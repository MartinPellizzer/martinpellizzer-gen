    "intro": "Baphia punctulata subsp. descampsii, commonly known as the African violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical Africa. It features rosettes of velvety, ovate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a dark center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
