    "intro": "Berberis trollii, commonly known as the Armenian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features thorny stems and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The berries are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
