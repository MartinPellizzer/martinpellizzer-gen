    "intro": "Bromus subvelutinus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist to dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, often forming dense clumps. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Bromus subvelutinus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
