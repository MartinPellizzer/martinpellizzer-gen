    "intro": "Bennettia finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's bennettia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bennettia finlaysoniana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
