    "intro": "Batis fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found along shorelines. Batis fruticosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
