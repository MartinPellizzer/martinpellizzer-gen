    "intro": "Bryonia multiflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the genus Bryonia in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in the axils of the leaves, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
