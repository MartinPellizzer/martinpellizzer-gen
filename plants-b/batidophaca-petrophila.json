    "intro": "Batidophaca petrophila, commonly known as the rock-loving orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, which helps in attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are highly specialized to absorb moisture from crevices in the rock formations. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
