    "intro": "Brasilidium, commonly known as the Brazilian fireplant, is a unique genus within the family Bromeliaceae. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Brasilidium species typically have rosette-shaped leaves that collect water, supporting the growth of epiphytic organisms. Due to habitat loss, many species are now considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
