    "intro": "Bakerophyton lateritium, commonly known as the red sandstone liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that thrives in moist, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous or sandy soils. The plant exhibits a distinct reddish coloration due to the presence of anthocyanins, which may serve as a protective adaptation against environmental stress. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Bakerophyton lateritium is often found in rocky habitats and is an indicator species for certain soil types and microclimates."
