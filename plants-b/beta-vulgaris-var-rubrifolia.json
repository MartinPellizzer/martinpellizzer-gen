    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf beetroot, is a variant of the beet plant characterized by its vibrant red foliage. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is cultivated primarily for its ornamental value due to its striking leaf color. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are usually smaller and less developed compared to the edible varieties of Beta vulgaris. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
