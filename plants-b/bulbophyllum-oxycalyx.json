    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oxycalyx, commonly known as the sharp-calyx orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are borne on slender inflorescences and are highly prized in horticulture for their beauty."
