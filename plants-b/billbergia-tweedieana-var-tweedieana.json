    "intro": "Billbergia tweedieana var. tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that typically displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps in water retention. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
