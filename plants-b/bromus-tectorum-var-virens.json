    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. virens, commonly known as cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but widely invasive in North America. It has slender, tufted culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is particularly adapted to frequent fires, which allows it to outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and high seed production contribute to its success as an invasive species in arid and semi-arid regions."
