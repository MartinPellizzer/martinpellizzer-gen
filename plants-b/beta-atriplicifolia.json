    "intro": "Beta atriplicifolia, commonly known as sea beet, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are rich in betaine, a compound that helps it tolerate saline and arid conditions. Sea beet is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines."
