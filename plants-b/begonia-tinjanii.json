It features velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns of silver and green. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts."
