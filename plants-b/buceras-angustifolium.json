It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has slender, upright branches covered in small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin. The species is often found in moist, woodland soils and is adapted to partial to full shade."
