    "intro": "Bolbitis guineensis, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Bolbitis guineensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in the study of fern botany."
