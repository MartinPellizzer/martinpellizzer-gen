    "intro": "Begonia longialata, commonly known as the long-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive markings. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Begonia longialata thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden beds and indoor cultivation."
