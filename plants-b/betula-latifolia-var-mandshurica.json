    "intro": "Betula latifolia var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
