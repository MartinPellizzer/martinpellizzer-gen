    "intro": "Berberis gratissima, commonly known as the Chinese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It features thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. Berberis gratissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
