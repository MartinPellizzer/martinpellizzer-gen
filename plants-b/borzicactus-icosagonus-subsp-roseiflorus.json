    "intro": "Borzicactus icosagonus subsp. roseiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered borzicactus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces striking, rose-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry environments. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
