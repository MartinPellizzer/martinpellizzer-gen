    "intro": "Bactris globosa, commonly known as the pink pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clustered leaves. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky fruit that resembles a pineapple but is typically smaller and has a pinkish hue. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Bactris globosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native regions."
