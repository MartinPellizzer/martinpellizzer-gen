    "intro": "Bambusa nutans subsp. cupulata, commonly known as the clustered bamboo, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. Its flowering occurs in summer, producing small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles. This bamboo is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ability to form compact, bushy clumps."
