    "intro": "Buxus arborescens var. aureolimbo, commonly known as golden-margin boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with distinctive yellow or golden margins on the leaves, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a rounded, bushy form. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for garden borders or as a foundation plant. Due to its slow growth rate and ornamental value, it is often used in formal landscaping and topiary designs."
