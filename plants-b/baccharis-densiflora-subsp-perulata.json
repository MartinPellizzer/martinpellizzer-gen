    "intro": "Baccharis densiflora subsp. perulata, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along the coast."
