    "intro": "Bulbophyllum illudens, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
