It features slender, silver-gray blades that are often lined with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, panicle-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, grass-like foliage and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
