    "intro": "Bassia eriantha, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Bassia eriantha is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
