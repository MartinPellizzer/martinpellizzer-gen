    "intro": "Buda platensis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant has a distinctive white flower that blooms at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Buda platensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
