    "intro": "Brickellia pulcherrima, commonly known as the Mexican beauty or brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia pulcherrima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
