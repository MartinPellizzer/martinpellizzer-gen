    "intro": "Bauhinia breviflora, commonly known as the velvetwood or yellow bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia breviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
