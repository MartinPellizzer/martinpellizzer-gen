    "intro": "Bromus pseudodanthoniae, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Bromus pseudodanthoniae is adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
