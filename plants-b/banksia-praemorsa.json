    "intro": "Banksia praemorsa, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia praemorsa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
