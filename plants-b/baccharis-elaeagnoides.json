    "intro": "Baccharis elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests and shrublands, and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
