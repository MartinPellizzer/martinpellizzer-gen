    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pachytelos, commonly known as the giant feathered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, and often pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
