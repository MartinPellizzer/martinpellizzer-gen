    "intro": "Begonia bismarckiana, commonly known as the Bismarck begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and garden displays."
