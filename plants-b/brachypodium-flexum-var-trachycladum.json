It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, curling leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptability and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
