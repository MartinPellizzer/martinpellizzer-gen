    "intro": "Bidens ferax, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Bidens ferax is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
