    "intro": "Bougainvillea spectabilis var. virescens, commonly known as the green-leafed bougainvillea, is a striking ornamental plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that typically display shades of pink, purple, or red, while its leaves are a distinctive bright green. The plant is a tropical shrub that thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. It produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. This variety is popular in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb or be trained as a hedge."
