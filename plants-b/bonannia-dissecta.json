    "intro": "Bonannia dissecta, commonly known as the serrated sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often deeply lobed, giving the plant its \"dissected\" appearance. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard seeds. The plant is valued for its unique wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
