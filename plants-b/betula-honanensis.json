    "intro": "Betula honanensis, commonly known as the Honan birch, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Betula honanensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in botanical gardens and parks."
