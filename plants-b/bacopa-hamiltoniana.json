    "intro": "Bacopa hamiltoniana, commonly known as water bead plant or Indian water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater bodies such as ponds and marshes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
