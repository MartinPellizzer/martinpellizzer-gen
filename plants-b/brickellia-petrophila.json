    "intro": "Brickellia petrophila, commonly known as the rock brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia petrophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
