    "intro": "Bobua, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, with stems that often root at the nodes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bobua is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
