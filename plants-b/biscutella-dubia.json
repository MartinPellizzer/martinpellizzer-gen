    "intro": "Biscutella dubia, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. Biscutella dubia is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows."
