    "intro": "Brachyachne tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a small annual grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Brachyachne tenella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
