    "intro": "Bumelia lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy bumelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Bumelia lanuginosa is often found in swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate saturated soils."
