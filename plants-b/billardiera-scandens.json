    "intro": "Billardiera scandens, commonly known as the silky oaks or the native wisteria, is a climbing shrub native to Australia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silky texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in pendulous inflorescences, followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Billardiera scandens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures."
