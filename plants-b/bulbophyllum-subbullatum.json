    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subbullatum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy, leathery leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom during the wet season. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
