    "intro": "Bromus lanceolatus var. danthoniae, commonly known as the Danthonia brome, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in habitat restoration projects."
