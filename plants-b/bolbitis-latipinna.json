    "intro": "Bolbitis latipinna, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its broad, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically divided into pinnately arranged segments, and the fronds are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Bolbitis latipinna is native to parts of Asia and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds."
