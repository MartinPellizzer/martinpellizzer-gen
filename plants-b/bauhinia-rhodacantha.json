    "intro": "Bauhinia rhodacantha, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. Its flowers are often visited by bees and birds, contributing to its ecological importance. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the environment."
