    "intro": "Begonia tenericaulis, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and spread in its natural habitat."
