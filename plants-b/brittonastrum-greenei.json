    "intro": "Brittonastrum greenei, commonly known as the Greene's brittonastrum, is a rare and unique plant species native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent-like leaves. Its botanical features include a basal rosette structure and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
