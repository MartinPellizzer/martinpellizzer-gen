    "intro": "Barleria prionitoides subsp. prionitoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
