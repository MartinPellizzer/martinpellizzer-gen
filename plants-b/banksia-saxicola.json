    "intro": "Banksia saxicola, commonly known as the granite banksia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Banksia saxicola plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as honeyeaters and bees."
