    "intro": "Begonia wilksii, commonly known as the Wilks' begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant patterns of silver and green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
