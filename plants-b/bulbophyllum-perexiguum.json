    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perexiguum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the tiny bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, fleshy rhizomes and produces tiny pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
