    "intro": "Bromus secalinus subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a life cycle that includes both vegetative and reproductive stages. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and adaptability."
