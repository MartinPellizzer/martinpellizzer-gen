    "intro": "Bermudiana filifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a low-growing plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a symbol of Bermuda's natural heritage."
