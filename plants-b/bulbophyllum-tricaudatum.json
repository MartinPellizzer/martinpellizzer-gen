    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tricaudatum, commonly known as the three-tailed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence that resembles three tails, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
