    "intro": "Bursera bicolor, commonly known as the white balsa or yellow balsa, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow, followed by the development of hard, resinous fruits. Its bark exudes a fragrant resin, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. Bursera bicolor thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and scrublands."
