It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Bertiera aethiopica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
