    "intro": "Baccharis calvescens var. villosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that appear in clusters, typically in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common species in xeriscaped landscapes."
