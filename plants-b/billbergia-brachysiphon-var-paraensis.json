    "intro": "Billbergia brachysiphon var. paraensis, commonly known as the Paraensis billbergia, is a bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
