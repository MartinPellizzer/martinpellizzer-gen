It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The flowers bloom during the rainy season, making it a notable plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
