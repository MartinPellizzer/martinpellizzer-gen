    "intro": "Baeria hirsutula, commonly known as the hairy baeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a typical feature of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Baeria hirsutula is generally herbaceous, with a compact growth habit and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
