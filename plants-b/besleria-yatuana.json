    "intro": "Besleria yatuana, commonly known as the Yatuana flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Besleria yatuana is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
