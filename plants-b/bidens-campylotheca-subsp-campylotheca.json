    "intro": "Bidens campylotheca subsp. campylotheca, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
