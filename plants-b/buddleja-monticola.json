    "intro": "Buddleja monticola, commonly known as the mountain buddleja, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Buddleja monticola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
