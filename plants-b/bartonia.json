    "intro": "Bartonia, commonly known as the \"mock buttonweed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that resemble small buttons, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plants are native to the Americas, particularly the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. Bartonia species are often found in moist, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and wetlands. They have small, heart-shaped leaves and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
