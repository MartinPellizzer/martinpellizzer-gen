    "intro": "Brunsvigia banksiana, commonly known as the firecracker lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, strap-like leaves and produces vivid red flowers that resemble firecrackers, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its underground bulb, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It blooms in late winter or early spring, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
