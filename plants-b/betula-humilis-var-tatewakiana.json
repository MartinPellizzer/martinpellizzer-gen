    "intro": "Betula humilis var. tatewakiana, commonly known as the Tatewakiana birch, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the dwarf birch. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, triangular leaves. The bark of this plant is typically smooth and pale, with a slight reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
