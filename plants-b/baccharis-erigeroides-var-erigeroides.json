    "intro": "Baccharis erigeroides var. erigeroides, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and growth habits make it a common component of desert and scrubland ecosystems."
