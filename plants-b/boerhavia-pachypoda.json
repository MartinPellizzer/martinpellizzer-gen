    "intro": "Boerhavia pachypoda, commonly known as the thick-stemmed blite, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and shallow. Boerhavia pachypoda is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
