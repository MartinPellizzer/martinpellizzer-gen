It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
