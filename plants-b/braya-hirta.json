    "intro": "Braya hirta, commonly known as the hairy braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Braya hirta is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in high-altitude environments."
