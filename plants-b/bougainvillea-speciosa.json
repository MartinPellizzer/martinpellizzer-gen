    "intro": "Bougainvillea speciosa, commonly known as the common bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, orange, and white, which are often mistaken for flowers. The true flowers are small and clustered in the center of the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Bougainvillea speciosa is a deciduous shrub that can grow into a woody vine, making it versatile for landscaping purposes."
