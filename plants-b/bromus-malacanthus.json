    "intro": "Bromus malacanthus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Bromus malacanthus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
