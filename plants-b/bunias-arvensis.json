    "intro": "Bunias arvensis, commonly known as field mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a biennial or annual plant that typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with a sturdy stem and alternate leaves that are lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many other regions. Field mustard is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and is known for its peppery taste when the leaves are eaten."
