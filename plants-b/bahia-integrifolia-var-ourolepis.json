    "intro": "Bahia integrifolia var. ourolepis, commonly known as the coastal bahia grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for erosion control in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and restoration projects. Its ability to withstand salt spray and wind makes it an important species in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
