    "intro": "Bromus pumpellianus var. melicoides, commonly known as the Melicoides brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
