    "intro": "Bromus arvensis subsp. splendens, commonly known as the splendour brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps it conserve water. This subspecies is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
