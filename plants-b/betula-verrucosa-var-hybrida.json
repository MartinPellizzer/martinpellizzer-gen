It typically grows in cool, moist environments such as northern forests and mountainous regions. The plant has small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces catkins for wind pollination. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Betula pendula and Betula pubescens, and is known for its adaptability to various soil types. The tree plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
