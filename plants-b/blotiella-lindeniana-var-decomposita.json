It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are thin and delicate, adapted for underwater growth. This variety is noted for its unique ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
