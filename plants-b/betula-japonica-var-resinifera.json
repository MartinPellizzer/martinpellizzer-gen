    "intro": "Betula japonica var. resinifera, commonly known as the Japanese birch or resin birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or white inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
