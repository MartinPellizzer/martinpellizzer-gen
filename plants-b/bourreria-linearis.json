    "intro": "Bourreria linearis, commonly known as the linear leaf burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal seed pods. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in late spring, followed by the distinctive, spiny seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. Bourreria linearis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
