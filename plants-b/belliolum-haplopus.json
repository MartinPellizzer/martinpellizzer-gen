It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their five lobed petals and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
