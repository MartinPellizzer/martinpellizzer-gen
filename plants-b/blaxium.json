It features palmate leaves with a waxy surface that reflects sunlight, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often blooming in late spring. Blaxium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to arid conditions and ornamental appeal contribute to its use in both garden and landscape design."
