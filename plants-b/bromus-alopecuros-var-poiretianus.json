    "intro": "Bromus alopecuros var. poiretianus, commonly known as the Poiret's brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing bristle-like florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
