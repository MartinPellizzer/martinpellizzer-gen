    "intro": "Besleria steyermarkiorum, commonly known as the Steyermark's besleria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. It typically grows as an epiphytic plant, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without being parasitic. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
