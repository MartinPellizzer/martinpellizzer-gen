    "intro": "Bauhinia rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive papery, often corrugated leaves that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a short pedicel. Its fruits are flat, pod-like structures that split open to release seeds. Bauhinia rusbyi is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
