    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum f. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false brome, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
