    "intro": "Baloghia, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Baloghia gummifera, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the tree can grow as a shrub or a small tree depending on the species. Baloghia is also valued for its latex, which has been used in traditional medicine and industrial applications."
