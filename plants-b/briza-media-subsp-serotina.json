    "intro": "Briza media subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, arching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom later in the season. Its flowering period usually occurs from late summer to early autumn, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The subspecies is distinguished by its delayed flowering compared to other subspecies of Briza media."
