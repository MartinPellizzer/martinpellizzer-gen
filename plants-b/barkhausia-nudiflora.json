It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters in height, featuring a robust, branching stem. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late summer, usually in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Barkhausia nudiflora thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
