It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. It requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth and flowering."
