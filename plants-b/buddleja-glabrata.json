    "intro": "Buddleja glabrata, commonly known as the smooth buddleja, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates. Buddleja glabrata is also valued for its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
