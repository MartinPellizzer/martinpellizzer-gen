    "intro": "Brickellia viejensis, commonly known as the Mexican brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia viejensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
