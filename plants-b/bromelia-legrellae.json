    "intro": "Bromelia legrellae, commonly known as the Guatemalan bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the cloud forests of Guatemala. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. Its flowers, which are typically orange or red, are borne on a tall inflorescence and attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in shaded environments."
