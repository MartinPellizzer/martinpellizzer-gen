    "intro": "Bifaria multicostata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of small, linear pinnae that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in humid conditions."
