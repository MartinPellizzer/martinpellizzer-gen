    "intro": "Bouteloua vaneedenii, commonly known as the Vaneeden\u2019s gramina, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
