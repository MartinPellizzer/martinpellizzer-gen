    "intro": "Bignonia longissima, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia longissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
