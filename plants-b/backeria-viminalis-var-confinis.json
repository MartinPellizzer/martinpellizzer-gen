    "intro": "Backeria viminalis var. confinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow. It is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and it produces small, round nuts that mature in late summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
