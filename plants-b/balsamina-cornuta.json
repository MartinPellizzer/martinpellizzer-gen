    "intro": "Balsamina cornuta, commonly known as the horned balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped calyces that encase its showy, trumpet-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Balsamina cornuta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens."
