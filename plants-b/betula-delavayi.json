    "intro": "Betula delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southwest China. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with doubly serrated margins, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, pendulous catkins and is often found in cool, moist environments at higher elevations. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
