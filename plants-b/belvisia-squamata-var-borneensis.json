    "intro": "Belvisia squamata var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean belvisia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forest growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Belvisia genus."
