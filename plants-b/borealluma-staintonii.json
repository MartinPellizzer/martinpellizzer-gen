    "intro": "Borealluma staintonii, commonly known as the Stainton's broadleaf, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Borealluma staintonii is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region."
