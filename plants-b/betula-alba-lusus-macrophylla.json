It is characterized by its distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The leaves are larger and more elongated compared to typical Betula alba, often with a doubly serrated margin. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
