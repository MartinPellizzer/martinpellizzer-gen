    "intro": "Bunias dubia, commonly known as the desert mustang or wild mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with gray-green, fuzzy leaves and small yellow flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas."
