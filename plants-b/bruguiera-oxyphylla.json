    "intro": "Bruguiera oxyphylla, commonly known as the mangrove tree or red mangrove, is a halophytic species that thrives in coastal saline environments. It is characterized by its stilt roots, which provide structural support in soft, waterlogged soils. The plant possesses pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in oxygen-poor tidal waters. Its leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bruguiera oxyphylla plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
