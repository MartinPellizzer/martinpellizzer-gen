    "intro": "Betula potamophila, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of white, pink, and gray, making it visually striking. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula potamophila thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and streams."
