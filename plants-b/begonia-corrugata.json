    "intro": "Begonia corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive corrugated or ridged leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Begonia corrugata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
