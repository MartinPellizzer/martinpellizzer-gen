    "intro": "Barosma scoparia, commonly known as coastal barosma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters and blooming during the warmer months. Barosma scoparia is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
