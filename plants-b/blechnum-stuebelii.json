    "intro": "Blechnum stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture. Native to New Zealand, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a dense, fern-like appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
