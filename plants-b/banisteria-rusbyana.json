    "intro": "Banisteria rusbyana, commonly known as the red spiderflower, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
