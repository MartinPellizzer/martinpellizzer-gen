It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and features small, rounded stems that store water. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
