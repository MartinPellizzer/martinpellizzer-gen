    "intro": "Bulbophyllum reichenbachii, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and delicate, waxy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance, often appearing in the wild during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
