    "intro": "Bolelia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bolelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, yellowish flowers in the spring. Bolelia humilis is known for its low-growing habit and is often found in dry, arid environments. It is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh conditions."
