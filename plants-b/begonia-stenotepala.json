    "intro": "Begonia stenotepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation. Begonia stenotepala prefers shady, moist environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
