    "intro": "Byrsella sanctae-rosae, commonly known as the Saint Rose's Bells, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Byrsella sanctae-rosae is considered a vulnerable species."
