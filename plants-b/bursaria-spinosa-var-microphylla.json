    "intro": "Bursaria spinosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, globular fruits that are typically brown and covered in hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
