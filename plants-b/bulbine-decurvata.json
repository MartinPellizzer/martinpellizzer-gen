It features a short, thick stem and produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
