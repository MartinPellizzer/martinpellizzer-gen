    "intro": "Busbeckia, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and are characterized by their distinctive, egg-shaped fruits. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often hairy, while the flowers are bell-shaped and usually blue or purple in color. Busbeckia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and edible fruits, which are rich in nutrients. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for coastal gardens."
