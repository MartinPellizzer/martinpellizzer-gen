    "intro": "Bertiera laxa var. bamendae, commonly known as the Bamenda bertiera, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, often with a slight reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
