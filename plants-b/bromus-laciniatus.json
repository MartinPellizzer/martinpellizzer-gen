    "intro": "Bromus laciniatus, commonly known as the cutleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely dissected, blade-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spike that bears small, spikelet-based flowers. Bromus laciniatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
