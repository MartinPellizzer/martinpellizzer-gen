    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus var. cymosus, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often forming dense mats that stabilize shorelines. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological resilience. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil against erosion."
