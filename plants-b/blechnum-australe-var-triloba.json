    "intro": "Blechnum australe var. triloba, commonly known as the Australian maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Blechnum australe species native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded gardens."
