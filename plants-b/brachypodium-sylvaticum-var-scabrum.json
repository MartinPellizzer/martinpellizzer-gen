    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough bracken, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two-rowed spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is notable for its resilience and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
