    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pingnanense, commonly known as the Pingnan orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
