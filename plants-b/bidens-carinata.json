It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Bidens carinata is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in wetland environments."
