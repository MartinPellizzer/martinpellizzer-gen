It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes. The flowers are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is typically found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. It has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is resilient to drought conditions."
