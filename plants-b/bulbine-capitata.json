    "intro": "Bulbine capitata, commonly known as the helmet flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers arranged in a dense, rounded inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Bulbine capitata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
