    "intro": "Belairia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny belairia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Belairia spinosa is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
