    "intro": "Bulbinella punctulata, commonly known as the starry bulbinella, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. It produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, unbranched stem. Bulbinella punctulata is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
