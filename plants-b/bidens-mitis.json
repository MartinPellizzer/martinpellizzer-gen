It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Bidens mitis is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
