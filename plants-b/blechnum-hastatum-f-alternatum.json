It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright silver-green fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a fan-like appearance and a serrated margin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
