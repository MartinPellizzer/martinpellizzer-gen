    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its specific name. The plant produces cylindrical flower spikes that are typically orange to yellow in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to coastal conditions."
