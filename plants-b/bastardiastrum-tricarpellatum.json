It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in regions with temperate climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive three-lobed structure in the ovary. Bastardiastrum tricarpellatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
