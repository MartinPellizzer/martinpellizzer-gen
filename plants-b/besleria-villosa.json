    "intro": "Besleria villosa, commonly known as the woolly besleria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip, and they bloom during the warmer months."
