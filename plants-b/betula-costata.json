    "intro": "Betula costata, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of Asia and the Arctic regions. It is characterized by its smooth, often white- or silver-colored bark and slender, branching form. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula costata is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
