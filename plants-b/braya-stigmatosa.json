    "intro": "Braya stigmatosa, commonly known as the desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, which helps reduce water loss. Braya stigmatosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
