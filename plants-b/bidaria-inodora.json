It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often grouped in clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Bidaria inodora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
