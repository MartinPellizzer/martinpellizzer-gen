    "intro": "Breynia microphylla, commonly known as the silver leaf breynia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Breynia microphylla is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt and drought. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and ornamental contexts."
