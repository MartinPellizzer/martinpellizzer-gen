    "intro": "Brathys japonica var. accumbens, commonly known as the Japanese brathys, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
