    "intro": "Baccharis subrufescens, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Baccharis subrufescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
