    "intro": "Beilschmiedia rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan beilschmiedia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Rwanda, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries as fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
