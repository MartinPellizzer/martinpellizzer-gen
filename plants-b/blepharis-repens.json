    "intro": "Blepharis repens, commonly known as the creeping blepharis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively through its stolons."
