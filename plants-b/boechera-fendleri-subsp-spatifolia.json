    "intro": "Boechera fendleri subsp. spatifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.
