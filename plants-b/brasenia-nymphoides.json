    "intro": "Brasenia nymphoides, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It has distinctive broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life. Brasenia nymphoides plays an important role in water filtration and supports biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems."
