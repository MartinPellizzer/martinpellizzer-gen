    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vulcanicum, commonly known as the Vulcan's Orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of yellow and purple. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
