    "intro": "Bulbine longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
