    "intro": "Borzicactus silvaticus, commonly known as the forest cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, spineless cactus with a rounded, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Borzicactus silvaticus thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
