    "intro": "Betula hupehensis, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal beauty. Betula hupehensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
