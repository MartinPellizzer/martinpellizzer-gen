    "intro": "Bignonia nitidula, commonly known as the silverleaf bignonia, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in the spring. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or structures. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
