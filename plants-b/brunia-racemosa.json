It is a perennial grass that grows in coastal areas, often on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Brunia racemosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
