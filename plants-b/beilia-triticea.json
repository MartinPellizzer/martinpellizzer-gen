    "intro": "Beilia triticea, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Beilia triticea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
