It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
