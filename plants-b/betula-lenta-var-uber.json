    "intro": "Betula lenta var. uber, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a variant of the cherry birch native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that emits a pleasant wintergreen scent when scratched. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and tool handles."
