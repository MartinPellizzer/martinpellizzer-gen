    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. campylote, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
