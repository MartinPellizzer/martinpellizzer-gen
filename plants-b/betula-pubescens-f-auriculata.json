    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. auriculata, commonly known as the hairy birch with auriculate leaves, is a botanical variant of the silver birch. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-shaped leaf lobes that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in boreal and temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a reddish tinge, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. This form is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
