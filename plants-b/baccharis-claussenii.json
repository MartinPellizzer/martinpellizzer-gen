    "intro": "Baccharis claussenii, commonly known as the Mexican baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Baccharis claussenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
