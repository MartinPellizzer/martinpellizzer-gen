    "intro": "Brachystelma cinereum, commonly known as the silver-stemed ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often reduced to scale-like structures, typical of many stonecrops. Brachystelma cinereum is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and tolerating periods of drought."
