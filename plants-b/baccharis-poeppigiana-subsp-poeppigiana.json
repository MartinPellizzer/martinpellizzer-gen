    "intro": "Baccharis poeppigiana subsp. poeppigiana, commonly known as bluecurls, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
