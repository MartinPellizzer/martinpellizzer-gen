    "intro": "Bulbophyllum refractoides, commonly known as the refractoid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, making it a visually striking addition to tropical gardens."
