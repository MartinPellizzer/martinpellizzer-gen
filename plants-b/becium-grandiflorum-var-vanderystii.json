    "intro": "Becium grandiflorum var. vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's becium, is a rare and unique variant of the becium genus native to specific regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests with well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
