It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white, often with intricate patterns. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
