    "intro": "Baccharis psilocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
