It is characterized by its grayish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid regions."
