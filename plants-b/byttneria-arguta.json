    "intro": "Byttneria arguta, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
