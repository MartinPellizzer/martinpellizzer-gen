    "intro": "Bromus madritensis subsp. delilei, commonly known as the Delile's brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and typically forms dense tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
