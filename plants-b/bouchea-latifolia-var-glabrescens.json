    "intro": "Bouchea latifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The smooth, hairless leaves of this variety distinguish it from other bouchea species."
