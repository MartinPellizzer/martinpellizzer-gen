    "intro": "Berberis saxorum, commonly known as the Alpine barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features spiny, thorny stems and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
