    "intro": "Berberis trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its berries contain alkaloids, making it both useful and potentially toxic."
