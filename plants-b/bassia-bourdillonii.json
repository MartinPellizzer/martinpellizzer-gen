    "intro": "Bassia bourdillonii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils in desert and semi-desert habitats."
