    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lobbii var. claptonense, commonly known as the Clapton's Bulbophyllum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in its natural range."
