    "intro": "Besleria pendula, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Besleria pendula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant floral display and trailing growth habit."
