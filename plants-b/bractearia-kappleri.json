It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its seed capsules split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
