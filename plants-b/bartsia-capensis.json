    "intro": "Bartsia capensis, commonly known as the Cape bartsia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or shrubland habitats. Bartsia capensis is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients."
