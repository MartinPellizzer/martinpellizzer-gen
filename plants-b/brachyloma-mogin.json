    "intro": "Brachyloma mogin, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, blue-black berries. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Brachyloma mogin is often found growing in rocky outcrops and open heathlands, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
