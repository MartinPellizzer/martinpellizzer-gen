    "intro": "Bartsia laticrenata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Bartsia laticrenata is often found in association with other parasitic and non-parasitic plants in its habitat."
