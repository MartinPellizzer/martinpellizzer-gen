    "intro": "Bursera acutifolia, commonly known as the Mexican birch or wild myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that resembles birch and its alternate, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing three to four seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Bursera acutifolia is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense."
