    "intro": "Brachiaria subquadripara, commonly known as partridgegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, sometimes hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance. Brachiaria subquadripara is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage systems due to its hardiness and adaptability."
