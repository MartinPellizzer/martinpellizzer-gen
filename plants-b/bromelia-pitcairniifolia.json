    "intro": "Bromelia pitcairniifolia, commonly known as the red-tipped bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding tank. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow throat. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Bromelia pitcairniifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
