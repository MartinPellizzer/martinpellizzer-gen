    "intro": "Biscutella austriaca var. trebejensis, commonly known as the Trebejensian biscuit vetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is a low-growing, perennial herb with small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces slender, hairy stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a vulnerable species."
