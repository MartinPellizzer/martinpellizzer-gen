    "intro": "Banksia prolata subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or golden in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its natural habitat."
