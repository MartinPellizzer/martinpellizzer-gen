    "intro": "Brachypterum koolgibberah, commonly known as the Koolkibberah burr bush, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, semi-arid climates."
