It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a distinct concave surface that gives it its scientific name. Bolboschoenus biconcavus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
