    "intro": "Bromus oxyodon f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is often mistaken for other grasses due to its simple structure and lack of showy flowers. This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in regions with moderate rainfall."
