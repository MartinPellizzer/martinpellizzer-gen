    "intro": "Biarum tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful growth habit and long blooming period."
