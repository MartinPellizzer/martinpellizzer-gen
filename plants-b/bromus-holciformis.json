    "intro": "Bromus holciformis, commonly known as the Holcus brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which contain small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus holciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
