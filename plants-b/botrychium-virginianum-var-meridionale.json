    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. meridionale, commonly known as the southern moonwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, club-shaped sporangia that are clustered on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually pale green and have a waxy appearance, which helps reduce water loss. The species is part of the Botrychiaceae family and is notable for its unique reproductive structures."
