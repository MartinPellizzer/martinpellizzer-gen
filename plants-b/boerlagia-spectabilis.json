    "intro": "Boerlagia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy boerlagia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often along rocky slopes or in open woodlands. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Boerlagia spectabilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
