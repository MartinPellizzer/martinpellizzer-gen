    "intro": "Bromus arvensis f. compactus, commonly known as the compact brome, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It typically forms low, tufted clumps with short, stiff leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions, often becoming an invasive weed in agricultural fields. Its ability to thrive in disturbed soils makes it a common competitor in grasslands and cultivated areas. The compact form of this variant distinguishes it from the more sprawling form of the species."
