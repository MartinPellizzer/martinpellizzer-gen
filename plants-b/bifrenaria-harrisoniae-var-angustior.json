    "intro": "Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harrisonia, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
