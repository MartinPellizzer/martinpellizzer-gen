It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spiny, spherical fruits. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Bryonia nana typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
