    "intro": "Bulbophyllum zobiaense, commonly known as the Zobia orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
