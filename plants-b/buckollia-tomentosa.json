    "intro": "Buckollia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly buckollia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Buckollia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
