    "intro": "Bromus compactus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, disturbed soils, and agricultural fields. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus compactus is often considered a weed in cultivated areas due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
