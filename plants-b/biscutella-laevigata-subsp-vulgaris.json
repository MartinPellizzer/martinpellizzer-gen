It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white tomentum. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes during the spring. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its name derives from the smooth texture of its leaves and its historical use in traditional medicine."
