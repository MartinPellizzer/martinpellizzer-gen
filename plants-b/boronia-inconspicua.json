It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Boronia inconspicua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract native pollinators."
