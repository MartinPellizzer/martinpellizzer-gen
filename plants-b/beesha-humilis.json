    "intro": "Beesha humilis, commonly known as the dwarf beesha, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Beesha humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
