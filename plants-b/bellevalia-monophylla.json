It is characterized by its unique single leaf and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
