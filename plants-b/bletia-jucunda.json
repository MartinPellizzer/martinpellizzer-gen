    "intro": "Bletia jucunda, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and swamps, often forming rhizomatous colonies. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, truss-like inflorescence, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Bletia jucunda is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
