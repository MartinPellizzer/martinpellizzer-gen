It is characterized by its elliptical, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna."
