It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The varietal form 'pilicaulis' is characterized by its particularly dense and woolly leaf hairs, enhancing its visual interest."
