    "intro": "Begonia puttii, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, deep green foliage and showy, bi-colored flowers that range from pink to red with yellow centers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums. Begonia puttii prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it relatively easy to care for with proper conditions."
