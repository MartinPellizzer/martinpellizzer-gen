    "intro": "Balanocarpus curtisii, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
