    "intro": "Bupleurum longifolium var. coloratum, commonly known as the purple root bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lanceolate leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are extensively used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties. This variant is distinguished by its more vivid purple pigmentation in both foliage and roots compared to the typical form."
