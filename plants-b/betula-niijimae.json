    "intro": "Betula niijimae, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula niijimae is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
