    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and montane forest ecosystems."
