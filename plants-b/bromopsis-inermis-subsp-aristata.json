    "intro": "Bromopsis inermis subsp. aristata, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
