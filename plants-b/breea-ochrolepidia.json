    "intro": "Breea ochrolepidia, commonly known as the yellow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a pale yellow to orange thallus with distinct, lobed structures. The plant's vegetative body consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality."
