It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
