    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aureum, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and compact growth habit. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. The flowers typically bloom during the rainy season, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat."
