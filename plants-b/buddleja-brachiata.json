    "intro": "Buddleja brachiata, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces long, panicle-like inflorescences that bear numerous tubular flowers, which are clustered in whorls. These flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies and other Lepidoptera, making it an important plant for pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
