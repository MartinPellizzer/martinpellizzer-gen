    "intro": "Beadlea truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf beadlea, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a truncate or notched base. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Beadlea truncata is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
