    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rufilabrum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red lip and greenish-yellow petals, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces aerial roots and has a sympodial growth habit, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are often clustered in racemes and attract various pollinators."
