    "intro": "Begonia diffusa, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, Begonia diffusa is widely cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
