    "intro": "Betula globispica, commonly known as the globe birch, is a rare and unique species of birch native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globe-like buds, which are tightly clustered and give the tree a unique appearance. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and pale in color. This species is adapted to cold and harsh environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Betula globispica is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
