    "intro": "Botrychium tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, leaf-like structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are delicate and lance-shaped, often appearing in a rosette formation. Botrychium tenuifolium is a rare and ancient fern species, with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era."
