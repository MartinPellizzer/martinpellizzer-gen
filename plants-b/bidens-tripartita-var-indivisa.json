    "intro": "Bidens tripartita var. indivisa, commonly known as the three-parted ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals and distinctive bracts, which are often mistaken for additional flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The species is notable for its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
