    "intro": "Betula fangiana, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula fangiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
