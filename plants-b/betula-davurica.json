    "intro": "Betula davurica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white bark, which peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, yellowish-green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Betula davurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of its native habitat."
