    "intro": "Brachystegia zenkeri, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark, spherical berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
