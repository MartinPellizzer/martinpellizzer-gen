    "intro": "Berberis caroliniana var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Carolina barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or as a ornamental plant in gardens. The berries are edible but have a slightly bitter taste."
