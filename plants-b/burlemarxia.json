    "intro": "Burlemarxia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom beneath the showy bracts, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Burlemarxia thrives in warm, humid environments with well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
