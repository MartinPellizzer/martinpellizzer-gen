    "intro": "Briza auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped grass or auriculate grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feather-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Briza auriculata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
