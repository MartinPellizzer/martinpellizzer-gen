    "intro": "Berberis macrotheca, commonly known as the broad-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and large, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
