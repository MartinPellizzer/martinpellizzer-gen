    "intro": "Busea acuminata, commonly known as the Indian bdellium or frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the dry regions of India, Arabia, and the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, resinous capsules that contain aromatic gum resins. These resins have been historically valued for their use in incense, medicine, and perfume. Busea acuminata is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
