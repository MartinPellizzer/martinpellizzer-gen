    "intro": "Begonia nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada begonia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
