    "intro": "Bletia subaequalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light and high humidity. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Bletia subaequalis is known for its ability to form pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and attractive species for orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
