    "intro": "Billbergia vittata var. rohanii, commonly known as the silver stripe billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-striped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
