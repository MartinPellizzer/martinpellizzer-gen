    "intro": "Betula alba var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive elliptical leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are usually narrower and more elongated compared to the standard white birch, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
