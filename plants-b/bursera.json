    "intro": "Bursera, commonly known as frankincense or bdellium trees, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico. Bursera species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their aromatic resinous sap. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture. The flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers often occurring on separate plants."
