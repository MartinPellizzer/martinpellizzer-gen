    "intro": "Balsamina setacea, commonly known as the featherleaf balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its flowers, which come in shades of red, pink, and white, bloom from late spring to early autumn. Balsamina setacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
