It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. The flowers are not only visually appealing but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
