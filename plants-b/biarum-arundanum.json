    "intro": "Biarum arundanum, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, aiding in photosynthesis. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize shallow aquatic environments. Biarum arundanum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
