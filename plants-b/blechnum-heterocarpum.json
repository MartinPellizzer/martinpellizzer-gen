    "intro": "Blechnum heterocarpum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Blechnum heterocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
