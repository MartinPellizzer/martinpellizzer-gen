    "intro": "Biscutella longa, commonly known as the longleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Biscutella longa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments."
