    "intro": "Blackstonia perfoliata f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-stemmed or white-leaved form of the common perfoliate, is a variant of the perennial herb native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its pale green to white foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green form of the species. The plant features slender, erect stems that often have a reddish hue, and its leaves are usually arranged in pairs along the stem. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typical of the Boraginaceae family. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
