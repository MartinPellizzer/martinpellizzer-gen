It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Byrsonima volubilis thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks."
