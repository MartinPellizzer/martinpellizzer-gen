    "intro": "Betula wuyiensis, commonly known as the Wuyi birch, is a species of birch native to the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian Province, China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat."
