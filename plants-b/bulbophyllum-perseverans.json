    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perseverans, commonly known as the persistent orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and red. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Bulbophyllum perseverans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
