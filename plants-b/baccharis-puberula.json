    "intro": "Baccharis puberula, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its green stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer. It is often found in dry, open areas such as scrublands and rocky slopes. Baccharis puberula is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid environments."
