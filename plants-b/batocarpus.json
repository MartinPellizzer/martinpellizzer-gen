It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. They typically have palmate leaves and produce capsule-like fruits containing small, smooth seeds. Batocarpus species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
