    "intro": "Bradlea, commonly known as the orchid vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers. Bradlea species typically have long, slender stems that twine around supports, and their leaves are often heart-shaped or ovate. The flowers are usually pendulous, with intricate, colorful structures that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to their ornamental value, Bradlea plants are cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens for their aesthetic appeal."
