    "intro": "Bolophyta tetraneuris, commonly known as the four-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across forest floors. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
