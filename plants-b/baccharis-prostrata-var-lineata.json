    "intro": "Baccharis prostrata var. lineata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its adaptability makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid regions."
