    "intro": "Bulbophyllum yangambiense, commonly known as the Yangambi orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often clustered in a raceme and bloom during the wet season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
