    "intro": "Biotia corymbosa var. alata, commonly known as the winged biotia, is a lesser-known species within the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like lobes on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its small, pale green to yellowish leaves are arranged in dense, clustered formations. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
