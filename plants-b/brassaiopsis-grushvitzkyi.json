    "intro": "Brassaiopsis grushvitzkyi, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Hainan Island in China. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region."
