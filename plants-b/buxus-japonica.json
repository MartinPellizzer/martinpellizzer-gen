    "intro": "Buxus japonica, commonly known as Japanese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning make it a versatile plant in ornamental gardening."
