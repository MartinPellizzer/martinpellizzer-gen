    "intro": "Buxus balearica, commonly known as the Balearic boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the island of Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus balearica is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
