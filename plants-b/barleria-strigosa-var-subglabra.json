It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy but less so in this variety. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
