    "intro": "Boswellia boranensis, commonly known as Somali frankincense, is a small, deciduous tree native to the Horn of Africa. It produces a fragrant resin that is harvested from its bark, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense for centuries. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with deep root systems. Its botanical features include smooth, grayish bark and small, leathery leaves. The resin, known for its therapeutic properties, contains boswellic acids that have anti-inflammatory effects."
