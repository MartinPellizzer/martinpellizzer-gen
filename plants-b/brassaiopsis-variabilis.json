    "intro": "Brassaiopsis variabilis, commonly known as the variable bracken fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season. Brassaiopsis variabilis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
