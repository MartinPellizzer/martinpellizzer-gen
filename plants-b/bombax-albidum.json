    "intro": "Bombax albidum, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a three-lobed capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth surface and pointed tips. The bark is smooth and light gray, often exuding a milky sap when damaged."
