    "intro": "Betula lanata, commonly known as the woolly birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and stream valleys."
