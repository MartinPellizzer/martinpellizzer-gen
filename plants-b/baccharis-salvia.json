    "intro": "Baccharis salvia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Baccharis salvia is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for native wildlife."
