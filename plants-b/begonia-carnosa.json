    "intro": "Begonia carnosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Begonia carnosa is popular as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
