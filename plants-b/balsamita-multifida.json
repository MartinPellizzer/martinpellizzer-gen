    "intro": "Balsamita multifida, commonly known as Mexican balsam or wild basil, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, often arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Balsamita multifida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
