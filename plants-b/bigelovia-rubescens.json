    "intro": "Bigelovia rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed bigelovia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that turn a reddish hue as the plant matures. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
