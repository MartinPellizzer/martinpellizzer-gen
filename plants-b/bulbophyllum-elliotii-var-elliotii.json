    "intro": "Bulbophyllum elliotii var. elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are borne on terminal racemes and bloom during the rainy season."
