    "intro": "Bolbitis crispatula var. copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, and crinkled fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for forest health."
