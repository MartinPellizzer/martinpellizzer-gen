    "intro": "Bauhinia amblyophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, papery flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia amblyophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
