    "intro": "Brickellia pringlei, commonly known as the Mexican brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, tubular flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Brickellia pringlei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
