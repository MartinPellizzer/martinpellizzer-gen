    "intro": "Bulbophyllum epiphytum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually fleshy and dark green, adapted for storing water. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
