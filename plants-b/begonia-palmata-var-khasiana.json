    "intro": "Begonia palmata var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
