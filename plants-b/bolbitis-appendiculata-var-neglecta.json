    "intro": "Bolbitis appendiculata var. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Bolbitis. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other varieties. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental addition to shaded garden settings."
