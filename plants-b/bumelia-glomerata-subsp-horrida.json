It is characterized by its densely clustered, small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has rough, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in association with other understory plants. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
