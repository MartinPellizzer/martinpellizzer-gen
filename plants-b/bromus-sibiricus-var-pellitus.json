    "intro": "Bromus sibiricus var. pellitus, commonly known as Siberian grass or Siberian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned florets. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
