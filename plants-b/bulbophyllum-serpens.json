    "intro": "Bulbophyllum serpens, commonly known as the serpent orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces striking, snake-like flowers that are usually greenish-yellow with red or orange markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. Bulbophyllum serpens is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
