    "intro": "Bouteloua americana, commonly known as hairy grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is a perennial bunchgrass that typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both sides, giving it its common name. It produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are arranged in loose clusters along the stem. Hairy grama is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
