    "intro": "Betula gynoterminalis, commonly known as the western paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are small and clustered. Its leaves are triangular and serrated, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula gynoterminalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests."
