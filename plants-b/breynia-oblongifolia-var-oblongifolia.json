    "intro": "Breynia oblongifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It features succulent, oblong leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, red or orange fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
