    "intro": "Blastus borneensis var. pulverulentus, commonly known as the Bornean powderbug orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or among mossy substrates. Its scientific name reflects its origin and the powdery texture of its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
