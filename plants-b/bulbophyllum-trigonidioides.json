    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trigonidioides, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped pseudobulbs and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, white to yellowish velvety coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
