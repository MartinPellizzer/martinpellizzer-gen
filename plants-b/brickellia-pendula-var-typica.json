    "intro": "Brickellia pendula var. typica, commonly known as the hanging brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its pendulous inflorescences, which give it its common name, are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a cluster. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
