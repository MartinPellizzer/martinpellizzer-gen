    "intro": "Baccharis rufescens var. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
