    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and cliffs, showing a preference for well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned flowers. This variety is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
