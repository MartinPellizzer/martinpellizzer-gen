It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.
