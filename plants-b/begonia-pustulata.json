    "intro": "Begonia pustulata, commonly known as the bubble begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bubble-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. Begonia pustulata is often grown as a decorative plant in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
