    "intro": "Blechnum dilatatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually arranged in a compact, upright form, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
