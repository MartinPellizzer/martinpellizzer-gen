    "intro": "Bulbophyllum holochilum, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
