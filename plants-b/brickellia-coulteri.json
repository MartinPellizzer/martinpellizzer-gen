    "intro": "Brickellia coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Brickellia coulteri is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
