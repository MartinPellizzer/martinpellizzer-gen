    "intro": "Bromelia tubulosa, commonly known as the tube bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant features a rosette of narrow, tubular leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, emerge from the center of the leaf rosette and are often short-lived. Bromelia tubulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
