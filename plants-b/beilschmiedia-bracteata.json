    "intro": "Beilschmiedia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Beilschmiedia bracteata is often found in lowland and montane rainforests, growing up to 30 meters tall. Its ecological significance lies in its role as both a habitat provider and a contributor to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
