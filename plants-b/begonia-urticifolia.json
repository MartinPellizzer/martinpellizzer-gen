    "intro": "Begonia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often bi-colored leaves that can range from green to red or purple. The leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact, hence its common name. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
