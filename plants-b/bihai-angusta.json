    "intro": "Bihai angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Bihai angusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
