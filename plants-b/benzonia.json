    "intro": "Benzonia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Benzonia species are often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and rocky areas. They are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
