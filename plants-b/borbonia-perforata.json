    "intro": "Borbonia perforata, commonly known as the perforate borbonia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with distinctive perforations along the margins. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
