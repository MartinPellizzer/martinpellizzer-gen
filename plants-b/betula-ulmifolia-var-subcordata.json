    "intro": "Betula ulmifolia var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and finely serrated, subcordate (narrow-oval) leaves. The bark is smooth and white, peeling in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
