It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night. The fruit is a spiky, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
