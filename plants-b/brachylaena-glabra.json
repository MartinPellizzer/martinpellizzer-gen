It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Brachylaena glabra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
