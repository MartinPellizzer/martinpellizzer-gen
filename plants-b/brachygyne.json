    "intro": "Brachygyne, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plants typically have pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Brachygyne species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
