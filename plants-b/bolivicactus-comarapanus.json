    "intro": "Bolivicactus comarapanus, commonly known as the Comarapa cactus, is a species native to Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and a spiny appearance. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its thick, fleshy stems for water storage. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom during the dry season, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny form. This cactus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife."
