    "intro": "Borassus ihur, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to tropical regions of Africa. It has a slender trunk with a fibrous outer layer and produces large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered fruits containing a single, hard seed. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving, while the trunk is valued for its fibrous material. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate."
