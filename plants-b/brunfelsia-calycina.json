    "intro": "Brunfelsia calycina, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces egg-shaped, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly waxy texture. Brunfelsia calycina is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
