    "intro": "Begonia reginula, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns of silver or white veins. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to red, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
