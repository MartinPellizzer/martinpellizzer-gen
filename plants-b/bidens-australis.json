It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent white markings. Its seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Bidens australis is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
