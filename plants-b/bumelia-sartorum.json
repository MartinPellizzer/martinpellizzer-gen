    "intro": "Bumelia sartorum, commonly known as the Florida bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bumelia sartorum is often found in sandy soils along the coastlines of Florida and is adapted to coastal and wetland environments."
