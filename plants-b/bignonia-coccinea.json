    "intro": "Bignonia coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a vigorous, climbing vine that produces striking, tubular, orange-red flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat unpleasant scent. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in gardens for its ornamental value. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, making it a beneficial addition to native plant landscapes."
