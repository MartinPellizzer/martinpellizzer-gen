    "intro": "Bromidium hygrometricum var. tandilense, commonly known as the Tandil bromidium, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to Argentina. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
