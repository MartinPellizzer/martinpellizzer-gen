    "intro": "Biscutella valentina var. lamottei, commonly known as the Lamotte's biscuitroot, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
