    "intro": "Brassica erucoides, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and seed pods that split open to release seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. It produces small yellow or white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of long, slender pods containing numerous seeds. Brassica erucoides is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural contexts."
