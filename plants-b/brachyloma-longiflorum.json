    "intro": "Brachyloma longiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it to retain moisture in arid conditions. Brachyloma longiflorum is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
