    "intro": "Bunias erucago subsp. macroptera, commonly known as giant mustard, is a robust biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive mustard-like odor when crushed. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated racemes, which are typically followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in waste areas, and in cultivated fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
