    "intro": "Brachiaria nodosa, commonly known as hairy signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its common name. Brachiaria nodosa is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites, where it plays a role in ecological succession."
