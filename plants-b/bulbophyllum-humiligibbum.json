It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
