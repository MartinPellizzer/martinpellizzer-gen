    "intro": "Bilgea sandrasica subsp. longiana, commonly known as the longleaf bilgea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
