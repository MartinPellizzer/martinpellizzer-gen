    "intro": "Banara tessmannii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and unique wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
