    "intro": "Buxus macrophylla, commonly known as the English boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus macrophylla is widely cultivated as a hedge plant due to its ability to be shaped and pruned into intricate forms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes."
