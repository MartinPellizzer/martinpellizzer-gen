    "intro": "Bassia scoparia var. culta, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. After flowering, it develops into a dry, wind-dispersed seed ball, which is a key feature of its life cycle. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
