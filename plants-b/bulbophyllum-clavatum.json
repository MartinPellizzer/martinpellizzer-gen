    "intro": "Bulbophyllum clavatum, commonly known as the club-shaped orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and yellow, are often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
