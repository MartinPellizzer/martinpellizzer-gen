    "intro": "Buxus aquartiana, commonly known as the Aquatic Buxus, is a unique plant species native to specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms compact, rounded shrubs. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a glossy appearance, which helps in reducing water loss in its moist environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by berries, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
