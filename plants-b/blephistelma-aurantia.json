    "intro": "Blephistelma aurantia, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features a slender, upright stem with several oval-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. Its most distinctive feature is its bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The orchid has a complex root system adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its native environment."
