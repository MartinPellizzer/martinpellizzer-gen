    "intro": "Byrsonima vernicosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or yellow myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, waxy bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. Its fruit is edible, though often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
