    "intro": "Bellis sylvestris var. pappulosa, commonly known as the woodland daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features rosettes of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a woolly texture. The flowers are typically white with a yellow center, blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, shady woodland habitats and has a compact growth habit. This variety is distinguished by its hairy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
