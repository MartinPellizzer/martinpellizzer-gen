It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that resemble the head of a bull. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Bucephalon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
