    "intro": "Berberis aquifolium subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, dark green, holly-like leaves with spiny margins, and small yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and erosion control. Its subspecific distinction highlights its unique growth habit compared to other Berberis species."
