    "intro": "Bromus polystachyus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus polystachyus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
