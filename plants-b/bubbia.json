    "intro": "Bubbia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. Bubbia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. Their unique morphology and ecological role make them an important part of maritime ecosystems."
