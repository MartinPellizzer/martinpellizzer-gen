    "intro": "Bellis nutans, commonly known as the lying bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or yellow. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and spoon-shaped. Its flowers are borne on slender stems that droop downward, giving it its common name. Bellis nutans is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
