    "intro": "Begonia sarcocarpa, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and oval, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
