    "intro": "Bupleurum longicaule f. obtusiusculum, commonly known as the blunt-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a blunt tip, distinguishing it from other varieties of Bupleurum. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal gardens."
