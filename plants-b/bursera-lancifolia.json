    "intro": "Bursera lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used for incense and medicinal purposes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Bursera lancifolia is valued for its ecological role and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fragrant properties."
