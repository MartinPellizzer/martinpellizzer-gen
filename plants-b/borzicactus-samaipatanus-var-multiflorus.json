It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the dry season, typically in spring. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
