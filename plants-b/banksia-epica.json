    "intro": "Banksia epica, commonly known as the giant banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that can reach up to 2 meters in height, which are composed of numerous yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia epica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
