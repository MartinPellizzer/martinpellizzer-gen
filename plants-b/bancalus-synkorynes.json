    "intro": "Bancalus synkorynes, commonly known as the black-lung beetle, is a species of scarab beetle native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy black body and elongated, robust form. The plant it is associated with is the tree species *Diospyros kaki*, commonly known as the Japanese persimmon. The beetle's larvae feed on the roots of this tree, making it a significant pest in agricultural settings. Its life cycle includes a pupal stage that occurs in the soil, contributing to its impact on forest and orchard ecosystems."
