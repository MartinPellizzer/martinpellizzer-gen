It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are typically narrow and smooth, with a bluish-green color, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. This variant is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties of Bromus uruguayensis."
