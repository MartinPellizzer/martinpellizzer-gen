    "intro": "Bersama coriacea, commonly known as the smooth-barked acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Bersama coriacea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
