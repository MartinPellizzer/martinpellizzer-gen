    "intro": "Benzoin pulcherrimum, commonly known as the fragrant benzoin tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a resin when cut, which is harvested for its aromatic properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds."
