    "intro": "Bacopa alternifolia, commonly known as water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its genus, Bacopa, is part of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes other aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Bacopa alternifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
