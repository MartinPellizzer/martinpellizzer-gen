    "intro": "Baptisia cinerea, commonly known as the pale false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmate leaves composed of 5-7 oval leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Baptisia cinerea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
