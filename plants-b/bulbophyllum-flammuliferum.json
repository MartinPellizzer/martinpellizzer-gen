    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flammuliferum, commonly known as the flame-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, round pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
