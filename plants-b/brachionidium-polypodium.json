    "intro": "Brachionidium polypodium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the leaves. Brachionidium polypodium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
