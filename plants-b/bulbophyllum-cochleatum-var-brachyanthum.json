It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted for water storage in its natural habitat. The flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators."
