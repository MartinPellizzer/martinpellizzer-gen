    "intro": "Begonia virginata, commonly known as the Virgin's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia virginata is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures."
