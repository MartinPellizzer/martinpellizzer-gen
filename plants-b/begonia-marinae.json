    "intro": "Begonia marinae, commonly known as the sea begonia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its unique adaptations, Begonia marinae is a resilient species often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
