It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
