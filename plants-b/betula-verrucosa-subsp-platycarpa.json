    "intro": "Betula verrucosa subsp. platycarpa, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates."
