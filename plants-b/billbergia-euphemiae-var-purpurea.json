It features vibrant purple foliage with serrated edges, adding a dramatic visual element to any garden or indoor space. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
