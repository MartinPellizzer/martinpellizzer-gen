    "intro": "Biscutella auriculata var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
