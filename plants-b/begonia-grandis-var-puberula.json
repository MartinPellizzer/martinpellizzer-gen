    "intro": "Begonia grandis var. puberula, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
