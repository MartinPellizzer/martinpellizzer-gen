    "intro": "Bupleurum junceum f. rissoi, commonly known as the narrowleaf cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves with finely divided, lanceolate lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in terminal umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Bupleurum junceum."
