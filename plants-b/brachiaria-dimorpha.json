    "intro": "Brachiaria dimorpha, commonly known as partridge pea, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in panicles, which are visible during the flowering season. Brachiaria dimorpha is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
