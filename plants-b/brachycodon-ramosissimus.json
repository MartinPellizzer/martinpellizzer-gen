    "intro": "Brachycodon ramosissimus, commonly known as the coastal brachycodon, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Brachycodon ramosissimus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
