    "intro": "Brachyloma daphnoides subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy brachyloma, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, appressed hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters during spring, adding ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
