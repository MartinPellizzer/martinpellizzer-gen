It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their aromatic properties. The subspecies maroccana is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Ballota hirsuta."
