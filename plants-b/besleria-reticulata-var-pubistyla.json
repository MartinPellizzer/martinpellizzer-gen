    "intro": "Besleria reticulata var. pubistyla, commonly known as the hairy besleria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a prominent reticulate pattern on its surface. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, and it produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature. This variant is distinguished by its dense, pubescent foliage, which gives it its common name."
