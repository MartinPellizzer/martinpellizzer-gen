    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum f. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to North America. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with a rosette of lanceolate, deeply dissected leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, club-like formation at the base of the fronds. This rare and delicate plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
