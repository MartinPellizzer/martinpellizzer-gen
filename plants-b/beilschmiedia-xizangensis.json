    "intro": "Beilschmiedia xizangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan beilschmiedia, is a rare evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive aromatic scent, while its fruit is a dark, fleshy drupe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
