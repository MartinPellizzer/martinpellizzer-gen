    "intro": "Baccharoides schimperi, commonly known as the East African dune shrub, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of eastern Africa. It is a small, woody shrub that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in dry climates. Baccharoides schimperi plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
