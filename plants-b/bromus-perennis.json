    "intro": "Bromus perennis, commonly known as perennial bromegrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Bromus perennis is also used in some regions for forage due to its nutritional value for livestock."
