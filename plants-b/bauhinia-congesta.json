    "intro": "Bauhinia congesta, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and unique floral structure. Bauhinia congesta is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine."
