    "intro": "Brunellia subsessilis, commonly known as the small-leaved greenwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Brunellia subsessilis is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental potential in horticulture."
