    "intro": "Betula klokovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish or reddish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in taiga and mountainous areas. Betula klokovii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
