    "intro": "Bauhinia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky bauhinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and savannas. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature. Bauhinia viscidula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
