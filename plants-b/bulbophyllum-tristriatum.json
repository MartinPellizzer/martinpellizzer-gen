    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tristriatum, commonly known as the three-striped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and its striking, three-colored petals that often feature a mix of red, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
