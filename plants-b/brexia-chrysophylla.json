    "intro": "Brexia chrysophylla, commonly known as the goldenleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Brexia chrysophylla is closely related to other orchid species in the Epidendroideae subfamily. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
