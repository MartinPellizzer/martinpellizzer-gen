    "intro": "Bombax scopulorum, commonly known as the rock cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble cotton-like flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and smooth, grey bark. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
