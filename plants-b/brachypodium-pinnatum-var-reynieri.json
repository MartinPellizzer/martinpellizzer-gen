    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. reynieri, commonly known as the coastal bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in dune habitats and is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
