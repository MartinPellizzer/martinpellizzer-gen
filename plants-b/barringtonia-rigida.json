    "intro": "Barringtonia rigida, commonly known as the rigid barringtonia, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, often with a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
