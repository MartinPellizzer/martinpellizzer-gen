    "intro": "Brachiaria fasciculata var. carthaginensis, commonly known as Carthaginensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. This grass is valued for its use in livestock forage and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded environments."
