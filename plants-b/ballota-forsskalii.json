    "intro": "Ballota forsskalii, commonly known as the desert ballota, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters, with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Ballota forsskalii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
