    "intro": "Begonia polygonifolia var. differens, commonly known as the variegated polygon leaf begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often display variegation in shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its unique foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
