    "intro": "Botrypus parvus, commonly known as the small-fruit water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Marsileaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has four small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with tiny, spore-producing structures called soruses on the underside of the leaves. Botrypus parvus is characterized by its delicate, floating appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, muddy waters. It plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
