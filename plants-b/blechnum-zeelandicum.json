    "intro": "Blechnum zeelandicum, commonly known as the Zeeland fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the forest floor. The Zeeland fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
