    "intro": "Bromopsis riparia subsp. barcensis, commonly known as the Barcensian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. This subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Bromopsis riparia subsp. barcensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and small mammals."
