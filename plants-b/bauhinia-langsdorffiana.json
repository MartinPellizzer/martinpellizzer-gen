    "intro": "Bauhinia langsdorffiana, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fern-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral displays."
