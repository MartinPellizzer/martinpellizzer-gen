It features thorny stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
