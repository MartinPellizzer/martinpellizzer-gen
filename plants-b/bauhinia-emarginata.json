    "intro": "Bauhinia emarginata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often divided into pairs of leaflets. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in spring or summer. Its small, leathery fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Bauhinia emarginata is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
