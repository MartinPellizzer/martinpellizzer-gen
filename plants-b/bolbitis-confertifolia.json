    "intro": "Bolbitis confertifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that often float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Bolbitis confertifolia is often used in ornamental water gardening due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
