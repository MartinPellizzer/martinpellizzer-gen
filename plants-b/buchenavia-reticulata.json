    "intro": "Buchenavia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Buchenavia reticulata is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats."
