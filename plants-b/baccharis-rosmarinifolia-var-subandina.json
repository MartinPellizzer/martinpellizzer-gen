    "intro": "Baccharis rosmarinifolia var. subandina, commonly known as the silver baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and shrublands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
