It is a natural hybrid between Bassia aculeata and Bassia spinosa, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies of hybridization in arid flora."
