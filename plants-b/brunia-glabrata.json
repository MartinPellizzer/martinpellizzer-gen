It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Brunia glabrata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
