    "intro": "Bulbophyllum erythrostachyum, commonly known as the red-stalked orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange floral stems, which are often adorned with small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. The orchid produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
