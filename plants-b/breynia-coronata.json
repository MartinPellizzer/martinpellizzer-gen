    "intro": "Breynia coronata, commonly known as the Crowned Breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Breynia coronata is adapted to arid environments, with succulent-like stems that store water. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight."
