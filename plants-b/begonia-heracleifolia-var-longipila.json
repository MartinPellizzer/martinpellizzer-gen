    "intro": "Begonia heracleifolia var. longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden beds."
