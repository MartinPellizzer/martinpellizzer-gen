    "intro": "Bouteloua gracilis var. major, commonly known as blue grama, is a warm-season grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. Blue grama is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
