It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces a single, showy bloom on a tall stem, which is a notable feature in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and protected species."
