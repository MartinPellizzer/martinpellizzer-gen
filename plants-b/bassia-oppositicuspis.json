    "intro": "Bassia oppositicuspis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green foliage with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Bassia oppositicuspis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
