    "intro": "Bartsia coccinea var. pallens, commonly known as the pale-flowered bartsia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its paler floral coloration compared to the typical form of Bartsia coccinea."
