    "intro": "Begonia duncan-thomasii, commonly known as the Duncan-Thomas begonia, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display intricate patterns and shades of green, red, and purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
