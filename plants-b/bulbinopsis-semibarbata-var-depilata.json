    "intro": "Bulbinopsis semibarbata var. depilata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bulbinopsis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
