    "intro": "Bromus nemoralis, commonly known as the field brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus nemoralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
