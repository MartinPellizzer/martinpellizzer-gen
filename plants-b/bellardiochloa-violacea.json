    "intro": "Bellardiochloa violacea, commonly known as violet false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It has a clumping growth habit and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
