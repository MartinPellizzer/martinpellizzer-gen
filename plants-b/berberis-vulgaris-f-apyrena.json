    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris f. apyrena, commonly known as the thornless barberry, is a variant of the common barberry characterized by its lack of spines on the stems and leaves. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy green color. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
