    "intro": "Bolbitis andreisii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange fronds, which are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Bolbitis andreisii is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to improve water clarity."
