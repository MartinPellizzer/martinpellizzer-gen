It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
