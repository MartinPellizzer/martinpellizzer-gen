    "intro": "Bromus maximus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in panicles, with leathery, awnless glumes and small, pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in various soil types. Bromus maximus var. glaber is widely used in forage and erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
