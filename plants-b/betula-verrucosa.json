    "intro": "Betula verrucosa, commonly known as the European birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas. Betula verrucosa is valued for its timber and its role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
