These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and simple, alternate leaves. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Bucida species are known for their showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. They are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy soils and salt spray."
