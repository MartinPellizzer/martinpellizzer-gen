    "intro": "Blechnum tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's harts tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
