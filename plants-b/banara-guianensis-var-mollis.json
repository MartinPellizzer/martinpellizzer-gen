    "intro": "Banara guianensis var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved banara, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil and Guyana. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
