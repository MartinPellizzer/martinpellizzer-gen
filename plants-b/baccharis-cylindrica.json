    "intro": "Baccharis cylindrica, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to arid conditions and ornamental value make it a useful plant in both ecological and landscaping contexts."
