It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Blechnum vulcanicum plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
