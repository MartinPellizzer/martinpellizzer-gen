    "intro": "Broussonetia papyrifera f. laciniata, commonly known as the Japanese paper mulberry or laceleaf paper mulberry, is a variant of the paper mulberry tree native to East Asia. This cultivar is characterized by its finely dissected, lace-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 2\u20135 meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, such as papermaking, due to their fibrous texture. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
