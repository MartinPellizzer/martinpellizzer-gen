    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mahonii, commonly known as the Mahon's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal."
