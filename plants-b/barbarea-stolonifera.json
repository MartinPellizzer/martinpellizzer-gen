    "intro": "Barbarea stolonifera, commonly known as winter cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually lobed or divided, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and moist environments. Barbarea stolonifera is also notable for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to mustard greens."
