    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trirhopalon, commonly known as the three-lobed lady's tresses, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, three-lobed structure of the flower spike, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicately endangered species in its natural range."
