    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and usually covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
