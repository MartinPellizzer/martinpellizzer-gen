    "intro": "Begonia tribenensis, commonly known as the Congo begonia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
