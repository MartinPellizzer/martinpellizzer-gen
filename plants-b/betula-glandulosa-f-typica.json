    "intro": "Betula glandulosa f. typica, commonly known as the glandular birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its stems and leaves. This plant is native to the northern regions of North America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale underside, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are an important food source for early pollinators. Betula glandulosa f. typica is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
