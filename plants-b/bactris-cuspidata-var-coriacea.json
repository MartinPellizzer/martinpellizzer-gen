    "intro": "Bactris cuspidata var. coriacea, commonly known as the hard-leaved palm, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are resistant to damage, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized palm with a straight, unbranched trunk. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of palm wine."
