    "intro": "Bromelia aquilega, commonly known as the aquatic bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports various microorganisms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its vibrant, spathaceous flowers are often a deep red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Bromelia aquilega plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and breeding sites for aquatic life."
