    "intro": "Birolia alba, commonly known as the white birolia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals."
