    "intro": "Bidens cervicata, commonly known as the swamp tickseed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems and is characterized by its yellow flowers with dark centers, which bloom from late spring to early fall. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits called pappus, which aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Bidens cervicata thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
