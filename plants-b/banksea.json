    "intro": "Banksea, commonly known as *Cyperus alternifolius*, is a perennial wetland plant native to Africa, Australia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, dark green leaves that grow in a dense rosette. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Banksea thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
