    "intro": "Baccharis saltensis, commonly known as saltbush baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it an important component of dune ecosystems. Its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing sandy soils."
