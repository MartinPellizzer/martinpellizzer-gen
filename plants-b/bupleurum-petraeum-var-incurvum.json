    "intro": "Bupleurum petraeum var. incurvum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels and attract various pollinators. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
