    "intro": "Bryonia alceifolia, commonly known as the marsh bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
