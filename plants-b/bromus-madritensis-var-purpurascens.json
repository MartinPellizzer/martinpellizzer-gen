    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that often display a reddish-purple hue, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
