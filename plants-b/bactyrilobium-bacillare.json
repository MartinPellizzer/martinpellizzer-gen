    "intro": "Bactyrilobium bacillare, commonly known as the diatom, is a type of unicellular algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae. It is characterized by its intricate silica cell wall, known as a frustule, which is composed of two overlapping halves. These frustules exhibit a wide variety of geometric patterns, often resembling ornate designs. Bactyrilobium bacillare thrives in both freshwater and marine environments, playing a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems. Its ability to photosynthesize contributes to oxygen production and serves as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
