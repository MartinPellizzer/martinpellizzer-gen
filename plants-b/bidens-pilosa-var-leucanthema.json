    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. leucanthema, commonly known as whiteflower beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with white centers, which are followed by bead-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along waterways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions."
