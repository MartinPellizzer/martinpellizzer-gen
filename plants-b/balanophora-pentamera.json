    "intro": "Balanophora pentamera, commonly known as the red root orchid, is a mycoheterotrophic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrition. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it grows in shaded, humid forest environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which supply the plant with essential nutrients. Due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution, Balanophora pentamera is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
