It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish scales. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
