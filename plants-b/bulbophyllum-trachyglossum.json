    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trachyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in moisture retention."
