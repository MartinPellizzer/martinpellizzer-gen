    "intro": "Bulbine trichophylla, commonly known as the woolly bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick, fleshy stem and produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are thick, waxy, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It is well adapted to arid environments and can store water in its leaves and stem. This plant is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
