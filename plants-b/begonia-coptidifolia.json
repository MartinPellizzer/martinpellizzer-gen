    "intro": "Begonia coptidifolia, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
