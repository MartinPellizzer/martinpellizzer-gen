    "intro": "Betula komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Betula komarovii thrives in cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
