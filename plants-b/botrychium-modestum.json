    "intro": "Botrychium modestum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorangia, which are arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium modestum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
