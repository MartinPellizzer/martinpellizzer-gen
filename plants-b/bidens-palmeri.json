    "intro": "Bidens palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers with dark centers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens palmeri is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
