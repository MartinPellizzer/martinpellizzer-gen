    "intro": "Botryophora geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, ribbon-like stems that often form dense mats on moist, shaded rock surfaces. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name, and are usually small, ovate, and densely packed. Botryophora geniculata thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its simple structure and unique growth habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
