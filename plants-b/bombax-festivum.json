It is characterized by its large, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has a smooth, greyish-bark trunk and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth surface. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, cotton-like fiber."
