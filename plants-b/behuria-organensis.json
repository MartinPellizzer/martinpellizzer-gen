    "intro": "Behuria organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its botanical structure includes a short, thick stem with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
