    "intro": "Baphia leptostemma var. conraui, commonly known as the Cameroon baphia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
