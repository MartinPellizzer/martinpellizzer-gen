    "intro": "Bauhinia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bauhinia, is a shrub native to arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in its native habitat. Bauhinia calcicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
