    "intro": "Butia capitata var. lilaceiflora, commonly known as the lilac-flowered palm, is a striking variant of the Brazilian palm characterized by its unique, pale pink to lilac-colored inflorescences. This species is native to the northeastern regions of Brazil, where it thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant features a slender, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and its leaves are long, pinnate, and often have a bluish tint. It produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling small, yellowish dates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
