    "intro": "Bituminaria bituminosa var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded bituminous thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and spiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species in harsh climates."
