    "intro": "Bromus cespitosus, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple, and its inflorescence is typically a loose panicle. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Smooth brome is widely used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment."
