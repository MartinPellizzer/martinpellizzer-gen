    "intro": "Bulbophyllum disciflorum, commonly known as the disc-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, leathery leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive disc-shaped lip. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated for conservation and horticultural purposes."
