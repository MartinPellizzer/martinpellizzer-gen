    "intro": "Begonia obliquifolia, commonly known as the zigzag begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped leaves that give it its common name, and its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often variegated with contrasting colors, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes. Begonia obliquifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it adaptable to a variety of indoor settings."
