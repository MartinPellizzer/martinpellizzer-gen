    "intro": "Begonia stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, with five petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia stenoptera is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
