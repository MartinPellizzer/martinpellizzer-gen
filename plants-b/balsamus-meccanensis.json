It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
