    "intro": "Bulbophyllum breimerianum, commonly known as the Breimer's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, organic soil. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, with a unique labellum structure. Its bulbs are an essential part of its growth cycle, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
