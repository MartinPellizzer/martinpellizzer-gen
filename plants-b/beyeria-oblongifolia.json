    "intro": "Beyeria oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beyeria, is a perennial herb native to the eastern regions of Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest undergrowth. Beyeria oblongifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
