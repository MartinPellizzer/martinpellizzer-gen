    "intro": "Brookea, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from orange to red, resembling flames. Brookea species are typically shrubs or small trees, with palmately lobed leaves and a woody structure. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in warm climates due to their vibrant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
