    "intro": "Blephiloma amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf blephiloma, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features basal rosettes of large, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is notable for its waxy texture and ability to retain moisture, which aids in its survival in humid environments. Blephiloma amplifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
