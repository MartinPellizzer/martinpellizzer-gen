    "intro": "Baeria carnosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant to be handled with care. Baeria carnosa thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
