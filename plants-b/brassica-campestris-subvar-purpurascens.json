    "intro": "Brassica campestris subvar. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sprouting broccoli, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, leafy rosette and terminal inflorescence composed of small, cabbage-like flower buds. The plant produces a deep purple coloration in its stems and leaves, which is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. It thrives in cool climates and is typically harvested in early spring before the heads mature. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and distinctive flavor, making it a popular choice in culinary applications."
