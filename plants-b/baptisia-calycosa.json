    "intro": "Baptisia calycosa, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces cylindrical seedpods that split open to release its seeds. It is often found in open woods and prairies, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Baptisia calycosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
