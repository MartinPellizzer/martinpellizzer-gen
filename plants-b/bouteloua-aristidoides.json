    "intro": "Bouteloua aristidoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage. It is a perennial bunchgrass that thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soils. Blue grama is an important component of many grassland ecosystems due to its drought tolerance and ecological value."
