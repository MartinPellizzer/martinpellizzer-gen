It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Barkhausia amplexicaulis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
