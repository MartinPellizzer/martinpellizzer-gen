    "intro": "Bulbophyllum masarangicum var. nanodes, commonly known as the small-flowered bulbophyllum, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and challenging species to cultivate."
