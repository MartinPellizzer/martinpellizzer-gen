    "intro": "Burttia, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions across Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers and compound leaves. The genus includes several species, such as Burttia cuneata, which is known for its aromatic wood used in traditional medicine and incense. Burttia plants typically grow in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Their ecological importance lies in their role as a source of timber and their ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
