    "intro": "Betula alba var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its unique sticky resin on the bark. This resin, which gives the plant its common name, is secreted in droplets and can be easily rubbed off. The tree has slender, silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a lighter inner bark. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The sticky birch is a medium-sized tree with delicate, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn."
