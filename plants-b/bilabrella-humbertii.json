    "intro": "Bilabrella humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's bilabrella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
