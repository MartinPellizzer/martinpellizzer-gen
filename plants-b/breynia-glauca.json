    "intro": "Breynia glauca, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Breynia glauca is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
