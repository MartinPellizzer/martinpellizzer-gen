It is characterized by its velvety, deep purple foliage that contrasts beautifully with its clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and thrives in partial shade with well-draining soil. Its leaves are often variegated with shades of green and purple, adding visual interest to gardens or indoor spaces. Begonia purpureofolia is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and decorative purposes."
