    "intro": "Brunia alopecuroides, commonly known as the silver leaf shrub, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark stems. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
