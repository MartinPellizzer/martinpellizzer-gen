    "intro": "Begonia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
