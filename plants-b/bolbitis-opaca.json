    "intro": "Bolbitis opaca, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a rare and elusive fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds and a unique, almost velvety texture. This plant is typically found growing on the underside of rocks or on damp soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. Bolbitis opaca plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
