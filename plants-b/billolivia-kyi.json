    "intro": "Billolivia kyi, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are valued for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Billolivia kyi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
