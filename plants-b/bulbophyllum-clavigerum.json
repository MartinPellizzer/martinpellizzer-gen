    "intro": "Bulbophyllum clavigerum, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and blooming habits make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
