    "intro": "Bassia echinopsila, commonly known as the spiny goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Bassia echinopsila is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
