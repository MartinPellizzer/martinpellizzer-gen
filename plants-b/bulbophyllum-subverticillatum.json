    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subverticillatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped inflorescence and striking, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in fluctuating conditions. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
