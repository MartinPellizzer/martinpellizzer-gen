    "intro": "Boerhavia suberosa, commonly known as the hairy purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to thrive in dry conditions makes it a resilient species often found in disturbed soils. Boerhavia suberosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
