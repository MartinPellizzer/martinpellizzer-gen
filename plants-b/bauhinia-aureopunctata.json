    "intro": "Bauhinia aureopunctata, commonly known as the golden dot bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically borne in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a flat, leathery pod that splits open to release small, round seeds. Bauhinia aureopunctata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun."
