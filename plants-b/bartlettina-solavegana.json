    "intro": "Bartlettina solavegana, commonly known as the Solavegana bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a violet or purple throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Bartlettina solavegana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
