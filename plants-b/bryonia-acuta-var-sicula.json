    "intro": "Bryonia acuta var. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bitter cucumber, is a variant of the genus Bryonia, which belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae. This plant is characterized by its hairy, trailing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The flowers are typically yellow and occur in clusters, while the fruit is a thick-walled, spiny capsule that contains toxic seeds. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
