    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus f. natans, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and distinctive inflorescence. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, yellowish-white flowers atop a tall, slender stem, which is typically emergent from the water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond edges. This subspecies is notable for its ability to create dense vegetation that supports aquatic life and stabilizes shoreline sediments."
