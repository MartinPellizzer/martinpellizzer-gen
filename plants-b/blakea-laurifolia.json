    "intro": "Blakea laurifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Blakea laurifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
