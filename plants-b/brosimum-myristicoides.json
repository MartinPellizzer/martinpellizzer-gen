    "intro": "Brosimum myristicoides, commonly known as the rubber tree or *Brosimum myristicoides*, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex sap, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been historically used for various purposes, including the production of natural rubber. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in lowland rainforests."
