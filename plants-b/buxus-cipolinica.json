    "intro": "Buxus cipolinica, commonly known as the Cipollina boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in a rounded or conical shape, making it suitable for topiary and hedging. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
