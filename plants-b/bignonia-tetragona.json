    "intro": "Bignonia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along stream banks and in moist woodlands. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have four angular lobes, giving it its common name. Bignonia tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
