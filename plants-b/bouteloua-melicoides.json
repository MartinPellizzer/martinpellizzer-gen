It is a perennial bunchgrass that thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. The plant has slender, blue-gray leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
