    "intro": "Barbarea hedgeana, commonly known as the hedge garlic or winter cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The plant has pinnately divided leaves and produces small, round, greenish-yellow fruits known as siliques. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. Barbarea hedgeana is known for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
