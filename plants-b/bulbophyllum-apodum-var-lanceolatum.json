    "intro": "Bulbophyllum apodum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are usually elliptical or lanceolate in shape, which is reflected in its varietal name. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
