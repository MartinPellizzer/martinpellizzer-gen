    "intro": "Bremeria scabrella, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Bremeria scabrella is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems."
