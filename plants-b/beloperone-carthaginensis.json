    "intro": "Beloperone carthaginensis, commonly known as the Carthaginian beloperone, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
