    "intro": "Betula insularis, commonly known as the island birch, is a small deciduous tree native to the remote islands of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, pale bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils."
