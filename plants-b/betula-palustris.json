    "intro": "Betula palustris, commonly known as the black spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northern regions of North America and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Betula palustris thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
