    "intro": "Boechera lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbage and mustard. This species typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its small, white or yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Boechera lyallii is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in areas with well-drained soil and full sun."
