    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kainochiloides, commonly known as the Kainochiloides orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a unique, spurred lip that aids in pollination."
