    "intro": "Borzicactus celsianus var. trollii, commonly known as the Troll's cactus, is a unique and rare species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
