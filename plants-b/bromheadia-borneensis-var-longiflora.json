    "intro": "Bromheadia borneensis var. longiflora, commonly known as the Bornean bromheadia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, long-stemmed inflorescences that bear numerous white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in shaded, moist environments within the understorey of tropical forests. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem."
