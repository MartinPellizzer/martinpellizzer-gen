    "intro": "Bromus mollis subsp. affinis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and pastures. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often hairless or only slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green sheen. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. This species is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid environments."
