    "intro": "Baccharis cuneifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone regions."
