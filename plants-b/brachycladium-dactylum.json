    "intro": "Brachycladium dactylum, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological restoration projects in beach and dune habitats."
