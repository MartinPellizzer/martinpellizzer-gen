    "intro": "Blaeria eriantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Blaeria eriantha is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
