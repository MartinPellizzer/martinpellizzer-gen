    "intro": "Brunonia simplex, commonly known as the coastal wallaby bush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments. It is often found growing along shorelines and in dunes, where it helps stabilize the soil. Brunonia simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
