    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered pineapple orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fleshy, succulent pseudobulbs that store water. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid is popular among growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
