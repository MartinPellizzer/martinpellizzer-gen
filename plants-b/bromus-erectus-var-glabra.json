    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and smooth, hairless leaves, which distinguish it from other bromus varieties. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is widely used in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
