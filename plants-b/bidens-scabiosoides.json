    "intro": "Bidens scabiosoides, commonly known as the scarlet bidens, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by reddish-purple ray florets, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats."
