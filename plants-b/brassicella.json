    "intro": "Brassicella, commonly known as the \"false mustard,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. These plants typically have small, four-petaled flowers that are often white or purple in color. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough or hairy texture. Brassicella species are often found in rocky or disturbed soils, and they can be annual or perennial depending on the species. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
