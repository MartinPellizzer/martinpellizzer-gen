    "intro": "Baccharis leucopappa, commonly known as whiteleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and dense growth habit make it a valuable plant for erosion control in dry landscapes. Baccharis leucopappa is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for its purported healing properties."
