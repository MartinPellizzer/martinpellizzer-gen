    "intro": "Bromelica geyeri var. howellii, commonly known as the Howell's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spiky flower spikes that often display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small ecosystem within the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
