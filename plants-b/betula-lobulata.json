    "intro": "Betula lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and dark bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or near streams. Betula lobulata is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
