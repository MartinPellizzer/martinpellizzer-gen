    "intro": "Bulbophyllum prianganense, commonly known as the Priangan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, often showy flower with a distinctive lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
