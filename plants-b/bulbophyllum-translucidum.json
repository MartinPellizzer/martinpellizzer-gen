    "intro": "Bulbophyllum translucidum, commonly known as the translucent orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a prominent yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions."
