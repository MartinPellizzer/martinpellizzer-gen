    "intro": "Bactris humilis, commonly known as the dwarf palm or small palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant is characterized by its short, clustered stems and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Bactris humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible fruits, though the plant is more valued for its ornamental and cultural significance."
