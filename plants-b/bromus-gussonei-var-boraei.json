It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in extremely cold and arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local microorganisms in its harsh environment. Its adaptations include a short growing season and the ability to survive extreme temperature fluctuations."
