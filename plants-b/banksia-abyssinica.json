    "intro": "Banksia abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the southwest of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Its leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Banksia abyssinica is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
