The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. Boehmeria sieboldiana is valued for its strong, durable fibers, which have been traditionally used in papermaking and textiles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
