    "intro": "Betula pendula var. tristis, commonly known as weeping birch, is a variant of the silver birch characterized by its pendulous branches that droop like a weeping willow. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and white, with a peeling texture, and the leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring and is valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a popular choice for horticultural use."
