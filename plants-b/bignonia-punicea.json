    "intro": "Bignonia punicea, commonly known as the scarlet trumpetbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces long, woody seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Bignonia punicea is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
