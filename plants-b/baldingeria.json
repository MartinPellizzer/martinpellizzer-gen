    "intro": "Baldingeria, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plants are characterized by their showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Baldingeria species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce seed heads that are cylindrical in shape. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to support pollinators like butterflies and bees."
