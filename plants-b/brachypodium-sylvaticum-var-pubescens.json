    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bracken grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in botanical research due to its genetic similarity to other Brachypodium species."
