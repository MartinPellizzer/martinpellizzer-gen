    "intro": "Braya tilingii, commonly known as the Tilingii's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
