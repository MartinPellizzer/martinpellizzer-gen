    "intro": "Baccharis trinervis var. cinerea, commonly known as silver baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Silver baccharis is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
