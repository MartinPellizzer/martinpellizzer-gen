    "intro": "Balsamorhiza floccosa, commonly known as the woolly goldenbush, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reduce water loss. Balsamorhiza floccosa is often found in open woodlands and grasslands at higher elevations."
