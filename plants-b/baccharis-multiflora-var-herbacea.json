    "intro": "Baccharis multiflora var. herbacea, commonly known as coast sagebrush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration in coastal environments."
