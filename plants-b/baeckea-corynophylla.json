    "intro": "Baeckea corynophylla, commonly known as the pink baeckea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded environments. Baeckea corynophylla is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
