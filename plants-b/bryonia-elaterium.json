It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into toxic, orange-red berries. Its leaves and roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils."
