    "intro": "Breea segetum, commonly known as the grain weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. The plant is typically found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils, where it can become a problematic weed. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it challenging to control. Breea segetum plays a role in soil stabilization but is often considered a nuisance in cultivated crops."
