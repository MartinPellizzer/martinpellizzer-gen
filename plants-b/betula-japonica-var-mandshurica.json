    "intro": "Betula japonica var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian birch, is a deciduous tree native to northeastern Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
