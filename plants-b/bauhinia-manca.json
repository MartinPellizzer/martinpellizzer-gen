    "intro": "Bauhinia manca, commonly known as the purple bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are encased in flat, leathery pods, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia manca thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
