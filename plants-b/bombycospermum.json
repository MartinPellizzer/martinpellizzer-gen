    "intro": "Bombycospermum, commonly known as the African spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and its simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems but is also considered invasive in some areas outside its native range."
