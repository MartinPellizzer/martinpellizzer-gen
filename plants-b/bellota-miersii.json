    "intro": "Bellota miersii, commonly known as the Miers' bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bellota miersii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
