    "intro": "Berinia occidentalis, commonly known as the western berinia, is a perennial herb native to the western regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Berinia occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
