    "intro": "Betula alnobetula, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by clusters of small, winged seeds. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula alnobetula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks."
