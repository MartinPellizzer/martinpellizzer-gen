    "intro": "Batidaea strigosa subsp. subarctica, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to withstand harsh environmental conditions in polar and alpine habitats."
