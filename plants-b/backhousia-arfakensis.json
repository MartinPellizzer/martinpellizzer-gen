    "intro": "Backhousia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis backhousia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized shrub or tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often fragrant. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are an important food source for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
