    "intro": "Bidens frondosa var. caudata, commonly known as the slender tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with dark centers. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in wetland environments."
