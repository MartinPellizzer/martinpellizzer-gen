It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant has gray-green, narrow leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
