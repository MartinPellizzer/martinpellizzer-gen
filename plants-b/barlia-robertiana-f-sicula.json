It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense umbels, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
