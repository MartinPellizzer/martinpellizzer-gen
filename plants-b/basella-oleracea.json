    "intro": "Basella oleracea, commonly known as Malabar spinach, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as iron and calcium. It thrives in warm, humid climates and can be grown in both direct soil and hydroponic systems. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental and culinary use."
