    "intro": "Bonatea saundersioides, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori culture for various purposes, including weaving and construction."
