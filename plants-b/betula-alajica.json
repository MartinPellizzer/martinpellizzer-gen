    "intro": "Betula alajica, commonly known as the Alaj\u00edca birch, is a species native to the Andes mountain range in South America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The tree is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are elongated and serrated, turning yellow in the autumn before falling. Betula alajica plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
