    "intro": "Begonia dissecta, commonly known as the laceleaf begonia, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
