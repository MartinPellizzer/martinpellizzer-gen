    "intro": "Bergia decumbens, commonly known as the sandbergia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Bergia decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
