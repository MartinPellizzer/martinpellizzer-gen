    "intro": "Burmeistera weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's burmeistera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. This perennial herb is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
