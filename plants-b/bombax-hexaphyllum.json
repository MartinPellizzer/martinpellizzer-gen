    "intro": "Bombax hexaphyllum, commonly known as the six-angled silk-cotton tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically six to eight lobes. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, fluffy seed capsules that release cotton-like fibers. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual impact."
