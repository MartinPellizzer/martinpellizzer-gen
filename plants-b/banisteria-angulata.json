    "intro": "Banisteria angulata, commonly known as the angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that can be yellow, orange, or red. The plant is evergreen, with smooth, glossy leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. It produces berries that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its leaves and flowers."
