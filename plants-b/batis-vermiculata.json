    "intro": "Batis vermiculata, commonly known as the silky filbert, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Batis vermiculata typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
