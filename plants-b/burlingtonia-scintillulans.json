    "intro": "Burlingtonia scintillulans, commonly known as the shimmering bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique trait among flowering plants. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb that helps reflect light. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Burlingtonia scintillulans is considered an endangered species."
