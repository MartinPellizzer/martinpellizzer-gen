It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, often colorful flowers that can resemble a dancer in motion, hence its common name. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The flowers are usually borne on long, slender stems and can last for several weeks."
