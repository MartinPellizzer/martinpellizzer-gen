    "intro": "Bulbophyllum myon, commonly known as the Myon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid genera. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. The flowers are often yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination."
