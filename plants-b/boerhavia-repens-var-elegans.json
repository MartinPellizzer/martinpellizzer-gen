    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. elegans, commonly known as velvetleaf or redstem filaree, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
