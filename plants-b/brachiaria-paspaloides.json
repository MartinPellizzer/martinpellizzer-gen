It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. It has small, spike-like inflorescences and produces small, pale green to brown flowers. Brachiaria paspaloides is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in ecological restoration projects."
