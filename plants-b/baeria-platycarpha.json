    "intro": "Baeria platycarpha, commonly known as the broad-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark, berry-like fruits in the autumn. Baeria platycarpha is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
