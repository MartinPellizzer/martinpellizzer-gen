    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp. spryginii, commonly known as the spryginii grass, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas. It produces small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in botanical research."
