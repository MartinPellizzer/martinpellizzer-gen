    "intro": "Blechnum areolatum, commonly known as the areolate holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, areolate (segmented) fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a rugged appearance due to the prominent veins. Blechnum areolatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
