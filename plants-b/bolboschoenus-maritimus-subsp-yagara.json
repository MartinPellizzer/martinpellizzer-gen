    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp. yagara, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. This subspecies is adapted to tidal fluctuations and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
