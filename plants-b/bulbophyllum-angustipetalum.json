    "intro": "Bulbophyllum angustipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs."
