    "intro": "Berberis karnaliensis, commonly known as the Karnali barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. It typically grows in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. The plant is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh alpine conditions."
