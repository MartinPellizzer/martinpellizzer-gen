    "intro": "Begonia minima, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a small, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
