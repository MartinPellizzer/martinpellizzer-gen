It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that often display striking purple or red veins, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its foliage is particularly notable for its ornamental value, often used in horticultural displays for its vibrant color contrast."
