    "intro": "Billbergia thyrsoidea var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features tall, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with the inner leaves often curling inward to create a water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with red bracts and yellow flowers, adding visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. This variety is popular in tropical landscapes and as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance."
