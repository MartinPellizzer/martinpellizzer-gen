    "intro": "Beltrania crenatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf beltrania, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, wavy-edged leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
