    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nilgherrense, commonly known as the Nilgiri orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the monsoon season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, while its leaves are broad and fleshy. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
