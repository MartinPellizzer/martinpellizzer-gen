    "intro": "Betula cordata, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of creamy-white to pale yellow beneath. The tree has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring. Its leaves are triangular with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula cordata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
