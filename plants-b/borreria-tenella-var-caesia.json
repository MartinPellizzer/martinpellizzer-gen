    "intro": "Borreria tenella var. caesia, commonly known as the bluebells of the desert, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Borreria tenella var. caesia is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
