    "intro": "Betula odorata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine birch, is a variant of the sweet birch that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown color underneath. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
