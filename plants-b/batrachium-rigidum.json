    "intro": "Batrachium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid swamp mallow, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Batrachium rigidum is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
