    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stalked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in late summer, which are borne on long, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its extensive root system helps stabilize shorelines and improve water quality by filtering sediments."
