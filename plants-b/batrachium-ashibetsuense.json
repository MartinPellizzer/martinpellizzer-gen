    "intro": "Batrachium ashibetsuense, commonly known as the Ashibetsu marsh orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Hokkaido, Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in marshy or swampy habitats. It has thin, fleshy roots adapted to absorb moisture from its wet environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
