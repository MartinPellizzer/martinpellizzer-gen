It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.
