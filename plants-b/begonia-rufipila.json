    "intro": "Begonia rufipila, commonly known as the red-stemmed begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and white. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia rufipila is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
