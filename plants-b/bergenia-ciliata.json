    "intro": "Bergenia ciliata, commonly known as the woolly bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on sturdy, upright stems. Bergenia ciliata thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
