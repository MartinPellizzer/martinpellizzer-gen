    "intro": "Brachiaria decumbens var. ruziziensis, commonly known as ruziziensis grass, is a tropical perennial grass native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes and stolons that allow it to form dense mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for pasture and erosion control. Its rapid growth and high biomass production make it an important forage species in tropical regions."
