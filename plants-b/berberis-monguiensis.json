    "intro": "Berberis monguiensis, commonly known as the Mexican barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and its historical use in traditional medicine."
