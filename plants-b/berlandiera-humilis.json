    "intro": "Berlandiera humilis, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, spreading stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night, hence its common name. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. Berlandiera humilis is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
