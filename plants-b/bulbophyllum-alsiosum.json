    "intro": "Bulbophyllum alsiosum, commonly known as the Alsiosum orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects."
