    "intro": "Bromopsis ramosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bromopsis ramosa is often found in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and rocky slopes."
