    "intro": "Betula fargesii, commonly known as the Farges birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval in shape, turning yellow in the fall. Betula fargesii is often found in subalpine and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils."
