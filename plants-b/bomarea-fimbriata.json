It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces an edible tuberous root, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Bomarea fimbriata thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing near streams or in forest understories."
