    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus var. scutariensis, commonly known as the Scutari reed or narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter contaminated water."
