    "intro": "Byrsonima hoehneana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *cereja-brasileira*, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. The fruit is edible, though its taste is often described as tart or sour, and it is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
