    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pseudotrias, commonly known as the false torch orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are thickened stems that store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum pseudotrias thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
