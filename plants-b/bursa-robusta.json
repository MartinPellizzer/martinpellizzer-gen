    "intro": "Bursa robusta, commonly known as the giant burr plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny burrs. These burrs are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Bursa robusta is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
