    "intro": "Brachystemma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often ephemeral blooms that appear above the soil surface. The plants typically have a short, fleshy stem with a single flower at the top, which opens only briefly during the day. Brachystemma species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Due to their short blooming period and rare occurrence, they are considered rare and are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
