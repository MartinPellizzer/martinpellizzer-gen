    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lemniscatoides, commonly known as the double pendulum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of two pendulous racemes that resemble a double pendulum, giving it its common name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a mix of white, green, and yellow hues, often with a contrasting lip. It is a lithophytic orchid, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks, and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its botanical interest lies in its striking appearance and specialized growth habits."
