    "intro": "Baccharis glandulosa, commonly known as brittle bluestem, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
