    "intro": "Beadlea goodyeroides, commonly known as the Cape primrose, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a trailing habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round leaves that are attractive in their own right. Beadlea goodyeroides is relatively easy to care for, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
