It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and healing properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
