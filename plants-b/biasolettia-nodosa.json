    "intro": "Biasolettia nodosa, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Biasolettia nodosa is slow-growing and can live for hundreds of years, making it a long-lived species with ecological and historical significance. Its structure and reproductive habits reflect its adaptation to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native habitat."
