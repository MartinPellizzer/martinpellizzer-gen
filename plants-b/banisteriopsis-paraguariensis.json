    "intro": "Banisteriopsis paraguariensis, commonly known as ayahuasca, is a woody climbing plant native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contribute to its traditional use in shamanic rituals. Its flowering and fruiting stages are closely tied to the tropical rainforest environment, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Due to its cultural and medicinal significance, it is also a subject of scientific research and conservation efforts."
