    "intro": "Bromus lateripronus, commonly known as the European false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that contain the flowering structures. Bromus lateripronus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
