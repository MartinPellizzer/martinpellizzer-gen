    "intro": "Begonia subpeltata nigricans, commonly known as the black-leaved begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. The leaves are typically velvety and have a unique, intricate pattern of veins that contrast sharply with the deep coloration. It produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
