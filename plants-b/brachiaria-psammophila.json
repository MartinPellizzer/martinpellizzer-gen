    "intro": "Brachiaria psammophila, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
