    "intro": "Blechnum fraxineum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, rounded pinnae that are often curled under. Blechnum fraxineum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of New Zealand's native forest ecosystems."
