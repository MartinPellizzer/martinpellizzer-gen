    "intro": "Betula cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests. Betula cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
