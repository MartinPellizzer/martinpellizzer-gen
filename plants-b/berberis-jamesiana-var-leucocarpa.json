    "intro": "Berberis jamesiana var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. The plant has thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape ornamental. The white-fruited variety is distinguished by its white or pale yellow berries, which contrast with the red fruits of other Berberis species."
