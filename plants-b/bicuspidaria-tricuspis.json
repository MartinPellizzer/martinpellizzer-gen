    "intro": "Bicuspidaria tricuspis, commonly known as the three-cusped sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Actinioidea. It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed oral disc and long, slender tentacles that are used for capturing prey. The organism exhibits a simple body plan with a central gastrovascular cavity and a basal pedal disc for attachment. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to substrates such as rocks or coral. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to marine biologists studying cnidarian diversity and adaptation."
