    "intro": "Bernardia megalophylla, commonly known as the giant fern tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. The plant belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and unique structure. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat destruction and over-collection."
