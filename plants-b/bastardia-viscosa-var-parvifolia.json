    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the sticky bastardia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, glandular-stemmed leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
