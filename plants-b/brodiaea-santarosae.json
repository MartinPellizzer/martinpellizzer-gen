    "intro": "Brodiaea santarosae, commonly known as the Santa Rosa brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
