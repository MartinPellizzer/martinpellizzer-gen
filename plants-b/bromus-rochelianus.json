    "intro": "Bromus rochelianus, commonly known as Rochel's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the spring to early summer, and it is adapted to a variety of soil types. Bromus rochelianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
