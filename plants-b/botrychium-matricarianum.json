    "intro": "Botrychium matricarianum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Botrychium matricarianum is a perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters."
