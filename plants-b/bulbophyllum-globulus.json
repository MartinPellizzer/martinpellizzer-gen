    "intro": "Bulbophyllum globulus, commonly known as the globe orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a pseudobulbous orchid, with thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its habitat in shaded, humid environments. The species is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
