    "intro": "Balboa membranacea, commonly known as the Balboa bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, round seeds enclosed in membranous pods. Balboa membranacea is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
