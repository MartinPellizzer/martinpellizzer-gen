    "intro": "Buxus pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate boxwood, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and horticultural settings."
