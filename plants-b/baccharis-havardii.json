    "intro": "Baccharis havardii, commonly known as whitebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Baccharis havardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
