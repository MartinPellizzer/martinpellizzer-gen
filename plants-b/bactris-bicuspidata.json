It is characterized by its short, slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, orange-colored fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and private collections."
