    "intro": "Brassavola scaposa, commonly known as the scapose orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, scapose (sheath-like) leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, organic-rich soils of its habitat. Brassavola scaposa is a perennial herb that thrives in humid climates and is often found in association with other native flora."
