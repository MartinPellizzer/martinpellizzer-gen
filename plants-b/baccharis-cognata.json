    "intro": "Baccharis cognata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Baccharis cognata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
