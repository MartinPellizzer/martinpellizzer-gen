    "intro": "Blechnum rupestre, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a rough texture. The plant thrives in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Blechnum rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
