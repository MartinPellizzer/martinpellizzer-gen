    "intro": "Betula viridis, commonly known as the green birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, light green bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
