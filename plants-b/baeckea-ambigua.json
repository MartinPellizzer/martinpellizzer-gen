    "intro": "Baeckea ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baeckea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its floral display is often followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. Baeckea ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
