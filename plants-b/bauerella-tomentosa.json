    "intro": "Bauerella tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bauerella, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Bauerella tomentosa is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators."
