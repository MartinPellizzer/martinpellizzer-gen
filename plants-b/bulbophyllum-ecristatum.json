    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ecristatum, commonly known as the ridged orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ridged pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Bulbophyllum ecristatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
