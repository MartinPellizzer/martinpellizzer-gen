    "intro": "Baphia myrtifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carpentry and musical instrument making."
