    "intro": "Billbergia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, striped foliage that resembles a zebra's coat. The plant features a central rosette of sword-shaped leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small reservoir for its roots and surrounding flora. Its flowering stems produce striking orange or red inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Billbergia zebrina is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
