    "intro": "Bactris chloracantha, commonly known as the yellow palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are often a striking yellow-green color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, which are followed by edible, round fruits. Bactris chloracantha is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in humid, well-drained soils. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit, which is used in local cuisines."
