    "intro": "Brassica napus f. annua, commonly known as the annual rapeseed, is a cultivar of the oilseed rape species characterized by its shorter growth cycle compared to its biennial counterpart. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring large, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are alternate, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are rich in oil, making it a valuable crop for agricultural and industrial purposes. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its high yield and nutritional content."
