    "intro": "Begonia heydei, commonly known as the Dragon Scale Begonia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that have a distinctive scale-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
