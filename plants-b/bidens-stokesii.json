It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, sunny habitats like wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, spiky fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
