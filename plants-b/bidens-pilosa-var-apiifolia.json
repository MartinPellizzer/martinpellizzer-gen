    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. apiifolia, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically clustered in groups of two. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many areas."
