    "intro": "Bambusa dolichomerithalla, commonly known as the long-awned bamboo, is a tall, slender grass species native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green color, providing a striking visual contrast to its slender culms. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that have elongated awns, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance. Bambusa dolichomerithalla is also valued for its lightweight yet durable culms, which can be used in construction and crafts."
