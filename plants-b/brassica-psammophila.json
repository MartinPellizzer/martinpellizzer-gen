It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing along coastal dunes. Brassica psammophila is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its success in harsh environments."
