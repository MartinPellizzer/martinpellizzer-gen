    "intro": "Blechnum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark purple fronds that turn green as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately divided with a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant."
