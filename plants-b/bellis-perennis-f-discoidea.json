    "intro": "Bellis perennis f. discoidea, commonly known as the \"daisy-like\" or \"disk daisy,\" is a cultivar of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive flower heads, which consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by white ray florets. The plant produces a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
