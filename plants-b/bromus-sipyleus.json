    "intro": "Bromus sipyleus, commonly known as the Sipley's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, which aids in its spread across suitable environments. Bromus sipyleus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
