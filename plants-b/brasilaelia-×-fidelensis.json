    "intro": "Brasilaelia \u00d7 fidelensis, commonly known as the Fidelensis hibiscus, is a hybrid shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
