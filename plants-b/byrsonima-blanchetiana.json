    "intro": "Byrsonima blanchetiana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Caraibe*, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, bright red fruits that are edible and resemble cherries, though they are not related to true cherries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The tree is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
