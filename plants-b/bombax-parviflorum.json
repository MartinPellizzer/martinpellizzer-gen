    "intro": "Bombax parviflorum, commonly known as the cotton tree or silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the early spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often shed during the dry season, contributing to its seasonal appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in various regions."
