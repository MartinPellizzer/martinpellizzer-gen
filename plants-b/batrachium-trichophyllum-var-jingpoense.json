    "intro": "Batrachium trichophyllum var. jingpoense, commonly known as the Jingpo fern, is a variant of the common batrachium species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
