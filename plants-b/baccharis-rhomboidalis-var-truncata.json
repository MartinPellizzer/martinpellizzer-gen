It is characterized by its narrow, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
