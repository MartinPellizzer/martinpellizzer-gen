    "intro": "Billbergia canephora, commonly known as the Brazilian coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native arid environments. Billbergia canephora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
