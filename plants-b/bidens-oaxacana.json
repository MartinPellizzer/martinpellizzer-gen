    "intro": "Bidens oaxacana, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small yellow flowers with distinctive white markings, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often branching. Bidens oaxacana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
