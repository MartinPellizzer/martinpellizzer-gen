    "intro": "Bonamia humistrata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in areas with high salt exposure. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and can become woody with age. Bonamia humistrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
