It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the appearance of holly leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments. Its root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for coastal vegetation. Bonellia seleriana plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
