    "intro": "Boswellia pirottae, commonly known as the Somali frankincense tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to the dry regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is used in traditional medicine and incense. The tree typically grows in rocky soils and has a gnarled, twisted trunk with thick, flaky bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. Boswellia pirottae is valued for its resin, which has been used for centuries in religious and medicinal practices."
