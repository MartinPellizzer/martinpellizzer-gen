    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens f. prostrata, commonly known as creeping box, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, mat-like formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its compact growth habit and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
