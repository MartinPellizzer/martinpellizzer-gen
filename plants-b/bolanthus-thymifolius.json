    "intro": "Bolanthus thymifolius, commonly known as the thyme-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often in late summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Bolanthus thymifolius is typically herbaceous, growing close to the ground with a fibrous root system."
