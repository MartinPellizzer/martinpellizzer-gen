    "intro": "Banisteriopsis byssacea, commonly known as the red-eyed woodpecker tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive red eyespots on its leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Banisteriopsis byssacea is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
