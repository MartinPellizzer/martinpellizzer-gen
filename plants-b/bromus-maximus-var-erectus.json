    "intro": "Bromus maximus var. erectus, commonly known as tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss. This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
