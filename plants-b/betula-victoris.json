    "intro": "Betula victoris, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its white or yellowish bark, which peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula victoris thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn yellow or red in the fall."
