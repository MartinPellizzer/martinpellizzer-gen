    "intro": "Blechnum auratum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum auratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
