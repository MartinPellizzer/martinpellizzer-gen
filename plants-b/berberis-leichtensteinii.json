    "intro": "Berberis leichtensteinii, commonly known as the Himalayan barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hedges and garden plantings in temperate climates."
