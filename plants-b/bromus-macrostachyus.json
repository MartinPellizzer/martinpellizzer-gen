    "intro": "Bromus macrostachyus, commonly known as the large-stemmed brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its roots form a fibrous network that helps stabilize soil. Bromus macrostachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
