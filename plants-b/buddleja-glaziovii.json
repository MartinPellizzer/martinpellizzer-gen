    "intro": "Buddleja glaziovii, commonly known as the Mexican butterfly bush, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its long, slender, gray-green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the Buddleia genus, known for its nectar-rich flowers that attract butterflies and other pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Buddleja glaziovii is relatively drought-tolerant once established, though it benefits from regular watering during dry periods."
