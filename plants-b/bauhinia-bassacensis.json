It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests and along waterways. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
