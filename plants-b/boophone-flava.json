    "intro": "Boophone flava, commonly known as the yellow bulbous lily, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, erect stems that bear showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant. Boophone flava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
