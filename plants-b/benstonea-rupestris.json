    "intro": "Benstonea rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in well-drained soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually a mix of purple and white, arranged in a spike. Benstonea rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
