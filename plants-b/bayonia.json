    "intro": "Bayonia, commonly known as bayberry, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Bayonia is often used in hedges due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its leaves and fruits have been historically used in traditional medicine and for making candles."
