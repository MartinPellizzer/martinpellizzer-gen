    "intro": "Bradburya insulana, commonly known as the insular bradburya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bradburya insulana is considered a conservation concern."
