    "intro": "Begonia sinuata var. langkawiensis, commonly known as the Langkawi begonia, is a rare and ornamental species native to the island of Langkawi in Malaysia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
