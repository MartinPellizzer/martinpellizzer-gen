    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lecouflei, commonly known as the Lecoufle's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its humid, shaded habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability make it a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
