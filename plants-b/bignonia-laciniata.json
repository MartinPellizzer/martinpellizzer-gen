    "intro": "Bignonia laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaf bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces striking orange to yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It is a deciduous vine that can grow up to 15 feet in length, often climbing supports with its tendrils. Bignonia laciniata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
