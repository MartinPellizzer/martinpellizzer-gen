    "intro": "Bartsia glauca, commonly known as the blue bartsia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are small, tubular, and often clustered in dense inflorescences, ranging in color from white to pale blue. Bartsia glauca is characterized by its reduced leaves and reliance on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
