    "intro": "Batrachium radians, commonly known as the glowing frog plant, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue light at night. The plant belongs to the family Piperaceae and is notable for its ability to produce a mild hallucinogenic compound in its leaves. Its growth habit is vine-like, with aerial roots that help it climb towards light. Due to its rare and ethereal appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and collectors alike."
