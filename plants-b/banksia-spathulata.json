    "intro": "Banksia spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. Banksia spathulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
