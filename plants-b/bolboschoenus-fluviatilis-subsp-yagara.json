    "intro": "Bolboschoenus fluviatilis subsp. yagara, commonly known as the Yagara bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
