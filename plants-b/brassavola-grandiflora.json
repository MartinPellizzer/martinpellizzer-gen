    "intro": "Brassavola grandiflora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it one of the most striking orchids in cultivation. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white with a deep purple or red lip, and they bloom in late summer or early fall. Brassavola grandiflora requires high humidity, indirect light, and well-draining potting media to thrive."
