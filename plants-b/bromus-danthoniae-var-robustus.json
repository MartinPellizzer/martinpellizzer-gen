    "intro": "Bromus danthoniae var. robustus, commonly known as the robust rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
