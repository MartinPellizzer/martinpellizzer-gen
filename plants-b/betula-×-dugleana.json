    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 dugleana, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula pubescens (downy birch). It is characterized by its smooth, often white- or silver-colored bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and coastal areas. Betula \u00d7 dugleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
