    "intro": "Brassica fruticulosa var. radicata, commonly known as the woolly mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with greyish-white, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and moderately deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
