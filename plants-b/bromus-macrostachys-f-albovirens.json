    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys f. albovirens, commonly known as the white-green brome, is a variant of the brome grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that exhibit a distinctive light green to white coloration on the underside. This form typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense tufts or clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to yellowish, with elongated, slender lemmas. It is a perennial species that thrives in moderate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
