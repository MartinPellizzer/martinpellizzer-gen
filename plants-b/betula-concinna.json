    "intro": "Betula concinna, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Betula concinna typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
