    "intro": "Brassica taraxacifolia, commonly known as the leafy mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves, which resemble those of dandelions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, cross-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Brassica taraxacifolia is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a wild edible."
