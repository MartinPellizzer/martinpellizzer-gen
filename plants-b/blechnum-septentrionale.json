    "intro": "Blechnum septentrionale, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also storing nutrients. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
