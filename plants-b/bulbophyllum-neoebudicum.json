    "intro": "Bulbophyllum neoebudicum, commonly known as the Neobudiclip, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, brightly colored flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. The orchid's floral structure is highly specialized, with a labellum that plays a key role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
