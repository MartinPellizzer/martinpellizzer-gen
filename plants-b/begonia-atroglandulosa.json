    "intro": "Begonia atroglandulosa, commonly known as the black gland begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that often have a purplish tinge. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
