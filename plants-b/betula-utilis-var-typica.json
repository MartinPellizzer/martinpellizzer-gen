    "intro": "Betula utilis var. typica, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
