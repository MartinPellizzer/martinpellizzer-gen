It is characterized by its unique, triangular-shaped pseudobulbs and elongated, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of tropical orchids."
