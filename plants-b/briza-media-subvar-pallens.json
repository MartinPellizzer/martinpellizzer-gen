It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and delicate, airy appearance, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and forms dense clumps with a fountain-like shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small, greenish-white spikes that add a subtle texture to the landscape."
