    "intro": "Byrsopteris standishii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and roots, while its fronds play a role in photosynthesis and reproduction. The species is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
