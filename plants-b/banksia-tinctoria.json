    "intro": "Banksia tinctoria, commonly known as the red banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and its leaves are narrow and leathery. Banksia tinctoria is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
