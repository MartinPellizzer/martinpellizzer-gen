    "intro": "Bowlesia lobata var. humifusa, commonly known as the low-growing form of the genus Bowlesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically features a compact growth habit with sprawling, fleshy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This variety is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
