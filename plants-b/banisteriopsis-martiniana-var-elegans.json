    "intro": "Banisteriopsis martiniana var. elegans, commonly known as the pink angel's trumpet, is a striking tropical shrub characterized by its elongated, pendulous flowers that range in color from pink to violet. Native to the Amazon rainforest, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are not only visually captivating but also attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. However, due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
