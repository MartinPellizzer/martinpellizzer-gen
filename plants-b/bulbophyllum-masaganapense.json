    "intro": "Bulbophyllum masaganapense, commonly known as the Masaganapense orchid, is a species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers display a range of colors, often with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
