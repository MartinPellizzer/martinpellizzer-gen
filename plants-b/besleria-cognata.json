    "intro": "Besleria cognata, commonly known as the flame violet, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Besleria cognata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
