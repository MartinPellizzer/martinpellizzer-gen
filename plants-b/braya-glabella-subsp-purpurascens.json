    "intro": "Braya glabella subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the pink-flowered whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale pink or purple flower color, which contrasts with the more commonly white-flowered B. glabella. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs."
