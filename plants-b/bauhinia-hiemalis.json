    "intro": "Bauhinia hiemalis, commonly known as the winter bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia hiemalis is well adapted to limestone soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
