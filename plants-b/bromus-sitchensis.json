    "intro": "Bromus sitchensis, commonly known as Sitka brome, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a single spike with short, compact branches. Bromus sitchensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
