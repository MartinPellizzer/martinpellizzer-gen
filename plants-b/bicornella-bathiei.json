It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed flower structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single stem that produces several flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery hair. Bicornella bathiei is primarily found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region."
