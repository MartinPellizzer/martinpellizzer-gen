    "intro": "Belvisia validinervis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is native to the humid forests of Central and South America, where it attaches to the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a dense network of veins. Its flowers are pale yellow and clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging to forest ecosystems."
