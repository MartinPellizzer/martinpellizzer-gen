    "intro": "Baccharis caespitosa subsp. procumbens, commonly known as creeping baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
