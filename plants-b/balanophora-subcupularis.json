    "intro": "Balanophora subcupularis, commonly known as the cupular bellflower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
