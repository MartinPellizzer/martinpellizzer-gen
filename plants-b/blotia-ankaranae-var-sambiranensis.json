    "intro": "Blotia ankaranae var. sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambirana lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, large, white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it has a short, sturdy stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
