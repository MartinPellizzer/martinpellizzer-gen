    "intro": "Berberis ruscifolia, commonly known as the redleaf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, spiny leaves that turn a striking red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal. Botanically, it belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense growth habit and thorny stems."
