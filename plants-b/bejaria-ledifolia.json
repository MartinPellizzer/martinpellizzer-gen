    "intro": "Bejaria ledifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's foliage. Bejaria ledifolia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. It is also known to be an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
