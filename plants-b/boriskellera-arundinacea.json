    "intro": "Boriskellera arundinacea, commonly known as reed canary grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Boriskellera arundinacea is valued for its high biomass yield and is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
