    "intro": "Besleria drymonia, commonly known as the red-flowered arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. Its striking red or orange spadix is a key botanical feature, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
