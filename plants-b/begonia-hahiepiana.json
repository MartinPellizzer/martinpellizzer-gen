    "intro": "Begonia hahiepiana, commonly known as the Hahiep begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display striking patterns of green, red, and white. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
