It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Boopis monocephala is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
