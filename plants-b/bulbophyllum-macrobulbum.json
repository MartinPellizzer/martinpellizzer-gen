    "intro": "Bulbophyllum macrobulbum, commonly known as the large-bulb orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its bulb-like structures, which store water and nutrients, are a key feature of its survival in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
