    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. vulgare, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Botrychium lunaria var. vulgare is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and ancient fern species."
