    "intro": "Bethencourtia rupicola, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its small, white or yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. Bethencourtia rupicola is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
