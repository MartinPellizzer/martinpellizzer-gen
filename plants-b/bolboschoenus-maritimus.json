    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus, commonly known as sea club-rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in marshes, tidal flats, and salt marshes. Its rhizomes form a network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Bolboschoenus maritimus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
