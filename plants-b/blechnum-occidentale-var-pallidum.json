    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often pale green in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The pale variegation of its fronds makes it a distinctive and ornamental species in horticulture."
