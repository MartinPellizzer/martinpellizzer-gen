    "intro": "Brassica musifolia, commonly known as the elephant garlic plant, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fleshy bulbs that resemble garlic but are more closely related to mustard. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The bulbs are often used in culinary applications, adding a mild, sweet flavor to dishes."
