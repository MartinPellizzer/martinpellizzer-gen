    "intro": "Baccharis tridentata var. subopposita, commonly known as desert gumplant, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are often multi-branched and can become twisted with age, providing structural support in harsh desert conditions. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its sub-opposite leaf arrangement, which contributes to its unique botanical identity."
