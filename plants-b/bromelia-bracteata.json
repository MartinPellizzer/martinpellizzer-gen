    "intro": "Bromelia bracteata, commonly known as the crimson bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and provides a habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are short-lived but are often followed by the development of new shoots, ensuring the plant's propagation. Bromelia bracteata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
