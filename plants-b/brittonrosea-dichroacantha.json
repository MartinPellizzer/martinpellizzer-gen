    "intro": "Brittonrosea dichroacantha, commonly known as the two-colored rosea, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces pale yellow or white flowers that open in the morning and close by afternoon. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
