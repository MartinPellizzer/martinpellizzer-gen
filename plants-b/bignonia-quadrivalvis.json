    "intro": "Bignonia quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved trumpetbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive four-lobed base. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to reveal four winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
