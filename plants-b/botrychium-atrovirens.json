It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a fiddlehead-like sporophyte with a single, delicate frond that unfurls into a compound structure. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the frond, a characteristic feature of the genus Botrychium. The plant is known for its delicate, fragile appearance and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
