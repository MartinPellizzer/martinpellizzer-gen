It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces tiny blue or violet flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Bacopa divaricata is often found in shallow waters, where it forms dense mats on the surface. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardening and water feature designs."
