It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic orchid, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting to its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or golden, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
