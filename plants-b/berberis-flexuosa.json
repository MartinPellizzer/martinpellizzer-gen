    "intro": "Berberis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Berberis flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
