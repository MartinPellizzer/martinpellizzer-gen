    "intro": "Bulbostylis decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
