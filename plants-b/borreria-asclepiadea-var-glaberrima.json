    "intro": "Borreria asclepiadea var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant features showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth texture. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water storage. The plant's latex contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism."
