    "intro": "Bergia perennis subsp. exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bergia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Bergia perennis subsp. exigua is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
