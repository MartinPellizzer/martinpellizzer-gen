    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that results from the cross between the paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and the dwarf birch (Betula nana). It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles that of the paper birch, though it is generally thinner and more delicate. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula \u00d7 sargentii is often found in moist, acidic soils in northern regions of North America."
