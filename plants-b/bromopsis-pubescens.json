    "intro": "Bromopsis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bromus, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures of the grass. Bromopsis pubescens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
