It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to blueberries, though they are less commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
