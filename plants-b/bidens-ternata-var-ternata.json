It features slender, branching stems and produces small, yellow flowers with ray-like petals. The plant has hairy leaves that are usually opposite or alternate in arrangement. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides."
