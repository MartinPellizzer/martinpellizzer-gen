    "intro": "Baeria coronaria f. anthemoides, commonly known as the anthemoid form of the crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This form is notable for its resemblance to the genus Anthemis, giving it its common name. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
