    "intro": "Bromus altissimus f. incanus, commonly known as the silverhair brome, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray inflorescence. It is a perennial plant native to the western United States, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. The silverhair brome is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
