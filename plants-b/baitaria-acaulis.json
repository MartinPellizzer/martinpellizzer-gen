    "intro": "Baitaria acaulis, commonly known as the stemless gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and lacks a distinct stem, with all leaves arising directly from the base. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
