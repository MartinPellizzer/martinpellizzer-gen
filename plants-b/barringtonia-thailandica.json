    "intro": "Barringtonia thailandica, commonly known as the Thai lantern tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially at night. The tree produces distinctive lantern-shaped fruits that hang from the branches, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, fibrous pulp. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and along roadsides in its native range."
