    "intro": "Bumelia ferruginea, commonly known as the rustybumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can be found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bumelia ferruginea is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
