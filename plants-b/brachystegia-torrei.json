    "intro": "Brachystegia torrei, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk and dense canopy. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Brachystegia torrei is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
