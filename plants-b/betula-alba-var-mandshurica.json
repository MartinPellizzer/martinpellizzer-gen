    "intro": "Betula alba var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a variant of the white birch native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, pale bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
