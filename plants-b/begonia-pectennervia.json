    "intro": "Begonia pectennervia, commonly known as the zigzag begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging veins on its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Its ornamental value lies in both its unique foliage and vibrant floral display."
