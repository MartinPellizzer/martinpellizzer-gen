    "intro": "Betula hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
