    "intro": "Bombax marginatum, commonly known as the red cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its fiber, which has been used in traditional textile production."
