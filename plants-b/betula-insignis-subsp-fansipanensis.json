The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive white to pale yellow coloration. This subspecies is notable for its ecological significance in mountainous ecosystems and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
