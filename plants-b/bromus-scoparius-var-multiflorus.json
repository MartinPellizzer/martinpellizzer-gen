It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a bluish-gray hue, and it is often found in low-nutrient environments. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
