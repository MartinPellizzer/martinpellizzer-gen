    "intro": "Beckmannia syzigachne subsp. hirsutiflora, commonly known as the hairy-fruited beardgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy bracts, which give it its subspecies name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and the leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
