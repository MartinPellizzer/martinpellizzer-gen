It is characterized by its dense, white curd made up of tightly packed flower buds, which are harvested before they fully open. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale. It thrives in cool climates and requires a long growing season to develop properly. The genetic diversity within this variety contributes to its adaptability and agricultural importance."
