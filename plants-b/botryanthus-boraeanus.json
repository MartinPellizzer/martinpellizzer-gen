    "intro": "Botryanthus boraeanus, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cold, rocky environments, typically growing at elevations above 500 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Botryanthus boraeanus plays a vital role in the alpine ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
