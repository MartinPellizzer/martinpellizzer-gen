    "intro": "Balanophora fungosa var. mariannae, commonly known as the Mariannae ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is a fully mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its root system is highly specialized, forming intricate relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native regions."
