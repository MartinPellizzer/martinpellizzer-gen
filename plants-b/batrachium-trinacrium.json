    "intro": "Batrachium trinacrium, commonly known as the Sicilian frog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its distinctive, frog-like appearance with a greenish-brown, warty stem and a single, showy orchid flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single, erect flower with a yellow lip. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
