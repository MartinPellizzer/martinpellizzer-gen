    "intro": "Bromus flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Bromus flabellatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
