    "intro": "Barbarea longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its distinctive feature is its elongated, beak-like siliqua, which is a type of dry fruit that splits open to release its seeds. Barbarea longirostris is often found in high-altitude habitats, where it plays a role in the local flora and may have limited distribution."
