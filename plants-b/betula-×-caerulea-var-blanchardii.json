    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 caerulea var. blanchardii, commonly known as the white birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of light gray beneath, creating a striking visual effect. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, cone-like seed clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, turning yellow in the fall. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
