    "intro": "Bouteloua longiseta, commonly known as hairy grama, is a native grass species found in the central and western United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower heads in late summer, which are arranged in loose panicles. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Hairy grama is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
