    "intro": "Blechnum acutiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum acutiusculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
