    "intro": "Botrychium matricarioides, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Botrychium matricarioides is often found in temperate regions and is known for its unique, fern-like appearance."
