    "intro": "Brongniartia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific brongniartia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
