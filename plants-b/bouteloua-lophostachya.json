    "intro": "Bouteloua lophostachya, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species of the United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tan to brown in color. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable component of native grasslands. Blue grama is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to recover quickly after grazing or fire."
