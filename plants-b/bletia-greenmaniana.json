    "intro": "Bletia greenmaniana, commonly known as the greenman's bletia, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with rhizomatous growth, producing erect, leafy stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understory of humid tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by small insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Bletia greenmaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
