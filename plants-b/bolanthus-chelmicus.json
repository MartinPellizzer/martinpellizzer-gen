    "intro": "Bolanthus chelmicus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, woolly seed pods that protect its seeds until favorable conditions for germination arise. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces a distinctive, globular fruit that splits open when mature. Bolanthus chelmicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
