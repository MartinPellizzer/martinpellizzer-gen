It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the fruit develops into a capsule containing fibrous seeds. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant appearance and unique texture."
