It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom during the wet season, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
