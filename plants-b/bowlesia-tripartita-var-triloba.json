    "intro": "Bowlesia tripartita var. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bowlesia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
