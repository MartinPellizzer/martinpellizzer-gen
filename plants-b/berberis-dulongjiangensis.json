It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
