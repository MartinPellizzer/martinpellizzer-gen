    "intro": "Botrophis actaeoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
