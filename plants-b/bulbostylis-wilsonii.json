    "intro": "Bulbostylis wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
