    "intro": "Boraginella ambacensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the cooler, high-altitude environments of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
