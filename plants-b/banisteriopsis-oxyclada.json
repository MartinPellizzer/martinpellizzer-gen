    "intro": "Banisteriopsis oxyclada, commonly known as the sacred yew or Amazonian yew, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not typically used in traditional medicine."
