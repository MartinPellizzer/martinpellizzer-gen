    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Bromus mollis var. vulgaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
