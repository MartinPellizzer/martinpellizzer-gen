    "intro": "Bolbitis oligarchica, commonly known as the royal holly fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive dark green color and a velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Bolbitis oligarchica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage."
