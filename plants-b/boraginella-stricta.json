    "intro": "Boraginella stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Boraginella stricta is adapted to survive in drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xeric habitats."
