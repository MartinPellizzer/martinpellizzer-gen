    "intro": "Borreria nervosa, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. Borreria nervosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in the early morning, hence its common name."
