It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a spherical shape. Boopis scapigera is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
