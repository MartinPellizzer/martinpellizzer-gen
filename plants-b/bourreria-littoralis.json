    "intro": "Bourreria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal broom, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Bourreria littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
