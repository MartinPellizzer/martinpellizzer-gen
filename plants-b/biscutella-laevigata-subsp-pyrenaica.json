    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
