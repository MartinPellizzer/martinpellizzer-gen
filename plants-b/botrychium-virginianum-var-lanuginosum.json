    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the hairy moonwort, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
