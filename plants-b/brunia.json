    "intro": "Brunia, commonly known as the African snowbells, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Brunia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, often with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
