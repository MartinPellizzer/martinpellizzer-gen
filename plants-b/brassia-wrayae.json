    "intro": "Brassia wrayae, commonly known as the Wray's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Brassia wrayae is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
