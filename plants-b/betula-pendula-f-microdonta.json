    "intro": "Betula pendula f. microdonta, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a unique variant of the silver birch characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive cascading appearance. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are small, triangular, and have a silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. The tree is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively hardy, though it may be susceptible to certain pests and diseases."
