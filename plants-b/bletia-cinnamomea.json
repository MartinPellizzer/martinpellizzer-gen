    "intro": "Bletia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, cinnamon-colored flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid conditions. Bletia cinnamomea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
