    "intro": "Brizochloa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bristlegrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid regions."
