    "intro": "Bromus reptans f. glaber, commonly known as the smooth brome grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, low-growing habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its specific epithet \"glaber,\" meaning smooth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
