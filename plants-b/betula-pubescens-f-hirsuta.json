It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and bark that is often grayish-white with a rough texture. The leaves are oval-shaped, typically with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the autumn. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. It plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
