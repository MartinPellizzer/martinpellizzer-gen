    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mandibulare, commonly known as the jaw orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters. Its unique, jaw-like shape of the flower is a distinguishing feature. It requires specific care, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive."
