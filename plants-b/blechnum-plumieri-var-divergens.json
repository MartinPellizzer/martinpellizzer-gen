    "intro": "Blechnum plumieri var. divergens, commonly known as the New Zealand sword fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are bioluminescent in some varieties, though this trait is more commonly observed in other related species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
