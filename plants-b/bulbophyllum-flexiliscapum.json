    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flexiliscapum, commonly known as the flexible-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and small, intricate flowers that often display a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storing water and nutrients. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
