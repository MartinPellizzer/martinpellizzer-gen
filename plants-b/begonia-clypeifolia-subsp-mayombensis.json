The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
