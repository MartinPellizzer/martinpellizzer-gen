    "intro": "Botryphile, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a type of orchid that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike. Botryphile is a perennial herb that prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
