    "intro": "Bunium amplifolium, commonly known as broadleaf fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its seeds are small and oval in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or dry habitats. The plant has a distinct anise-like aroma, which is attributed to its volatile oils."
