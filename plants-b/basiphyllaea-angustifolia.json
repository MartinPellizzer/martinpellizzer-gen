    "intro": "Basiphyllaea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and conservation areas."
