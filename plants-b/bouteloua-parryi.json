    "intro": "Bouteloua parryi, commonly known as Parry's gramain, is a native grass species found primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
