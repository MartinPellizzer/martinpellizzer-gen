    "intro": "Bromus sitchensis subsp. aleutensis, commonly known as the Aleutian brome, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the Aleutian Islands and Alaska. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shores and in tidal zones, thriving in temperate maritime climates. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
