    "intro": "Berberis longispina, commonly known as the long-spined barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
