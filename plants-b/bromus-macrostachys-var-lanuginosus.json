    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelike inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing branches, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense stands. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
