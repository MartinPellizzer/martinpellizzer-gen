    "intro": "Boerhavia arborescens, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree with erect, branching stems that are often covered in a sticky, milky sap. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and alternate, with a slightly hairy texture. Boerhavia arborescens is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
