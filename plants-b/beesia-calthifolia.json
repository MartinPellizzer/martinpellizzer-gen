    "intro": "Beesia calthifolia, commonly known as the marsh beesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Beesia calthifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
