    "intro": "Ballyanthus major, commonly known as the Irish bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are borne in terminal clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ballyanthus major thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
