    "intro": "Begonia trigonoptera, commonly known as the three-lobed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is often cultivated in both indoor and outdoor settings."
