    "intro": "Bauhinia delavayi, commonly known as the Chinese honeytree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, papery leaves that resemble parchment, and its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Bauhinia delavayi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
