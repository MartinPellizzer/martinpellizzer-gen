It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, typical of the genus Badula. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas."
