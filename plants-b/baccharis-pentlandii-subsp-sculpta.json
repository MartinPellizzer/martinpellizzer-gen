    "intro": "Baccharis pentlandii subsp. sculpta, commonly known as the sculpted baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grayish-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive, sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
