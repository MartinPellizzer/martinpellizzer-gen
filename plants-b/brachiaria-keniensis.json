It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachiaria keniensis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in savanna and grassland ecosystems. It plays a significant role in both agricultural and ecological systems in its native range."
