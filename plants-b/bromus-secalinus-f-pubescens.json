    "intro": "Bromus secalinus f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent annual brome, is a grass species characterized by its hairy leaves and stems. It is a cool-season annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with lemmas that are pubescent, giving it its specific epithet. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. This form is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can become a weed."
