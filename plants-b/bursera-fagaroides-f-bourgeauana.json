    "intro": "Bursera fagaroides f. bourgeauana, commonly known as the Mexican frankincense tree, is a unique variant of the Bursera genus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, simple leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces fragrant resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as incense. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical Bursera fagaroides."
