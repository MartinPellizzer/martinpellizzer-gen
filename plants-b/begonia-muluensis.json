    "intro": "Begonia muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often velvety leaves that can vary in shape and color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
