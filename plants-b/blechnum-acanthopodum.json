    "intro": "Blechnum acanthopodum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. The holly fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
