    "intro": "Blechnum australe var. hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to southeastern Australia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understoreys. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
