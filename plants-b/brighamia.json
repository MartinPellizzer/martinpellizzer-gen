    "intro": "Brighamia, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. These plants are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Brighamia species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves adapted to the arid conditions of their native habitat. They produce fruit that is edible and has a sweet, nutty flavor. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many Brighamia species are now endangered or critically endangered."
