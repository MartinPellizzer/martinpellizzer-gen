    "intro": "Becium stirbeyi, commonly known as the Moldavian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forest edges and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
