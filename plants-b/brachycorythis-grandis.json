    "intro": "Brachycorythis grandis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Brachycorythis grandis is a slow-growing species that thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
