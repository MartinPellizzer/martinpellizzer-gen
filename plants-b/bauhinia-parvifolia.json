It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Bauhinia parvifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
