    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Bulbophyllum dichotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
