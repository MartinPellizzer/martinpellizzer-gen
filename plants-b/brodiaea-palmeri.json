    "intro": "Brodiaea palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale lavender flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
