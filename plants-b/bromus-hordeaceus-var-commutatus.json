    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. commutatus, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are arranged in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are flat, rough, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil. This variety is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and as a forage plant for livestock."
