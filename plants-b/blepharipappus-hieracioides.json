    "intro": "Blepharipappus hieracioides, commonly known as the common blueweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The leaves are narrow and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
