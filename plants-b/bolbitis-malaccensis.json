    "intro": "Bolbitis malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Bolbitis malaccensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
