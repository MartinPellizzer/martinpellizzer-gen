    "intro": "Bulbophyllum levatii subsp. levatii, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often golden-yellow inflorescences. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
