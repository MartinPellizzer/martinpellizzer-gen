    "intro": "Begonia brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce clusters of small, delicate blooms throughout the growing season."
