    "intro": "Bucco imbricata, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that resemble petals, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous true flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Bucco imbricata is known for its long blooming period, adding color to gardens from late spring through early autumn."
