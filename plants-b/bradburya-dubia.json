    "intro": "Bradburya dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or pine flatwoods. The plant features a single, slender stem with a cluster of white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its delicate nature and limited range, Bradburya dubia is considered a species of conservation concern."
