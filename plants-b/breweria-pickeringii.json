    "intro": "Breweria pickeringii, commonly known as Pickering's breweria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has finely divided leaves that are often mistaken for grasses, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
