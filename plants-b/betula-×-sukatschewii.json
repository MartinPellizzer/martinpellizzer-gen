    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 sukatschewii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula pubescens (downy birch). It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in wet or boggy habitats. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring and is known for its adaptability to a variety of soil conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in reforestation projects."
