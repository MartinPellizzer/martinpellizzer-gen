    "intro": "Bladhia sciophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale green, are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Bladhia sciophila is considered a threatened species."
