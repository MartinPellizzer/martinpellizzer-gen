    "intro": "Baccharis ulicina var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
