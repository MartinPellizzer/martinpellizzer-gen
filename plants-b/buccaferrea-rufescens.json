It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
