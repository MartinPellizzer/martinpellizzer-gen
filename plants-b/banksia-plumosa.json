    "intro": "Banksia plumosa, commonly known as the feather banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are followed by woody cone-like structures containing seeds. Banksia plumosa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and dry inland regions. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native wildlife and habitat for various insects and birds."
