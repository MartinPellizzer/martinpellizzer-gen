    "intro": "Bistorta calophylla, commonly known as the purple bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, somewhat hairy stems that bear whorled leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Bistorta calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
