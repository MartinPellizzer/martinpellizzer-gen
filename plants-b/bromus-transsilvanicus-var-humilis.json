    "intro": "Bromus transsilvanicus var. humilis, commonly known as the Transylvanian bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in shaded or partially sunny environments. This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
