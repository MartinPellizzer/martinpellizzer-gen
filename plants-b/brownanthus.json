    "intro": "Brownanthus, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often surrounded by a series of bracts that form a cone-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Brownanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
