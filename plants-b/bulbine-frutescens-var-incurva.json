    "intro": "Bulbine frutescens var. incurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
