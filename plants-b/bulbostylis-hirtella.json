    "intro": "Bulbostylis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often difficult to distinguish from other grass species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Bulbostylis hirtella is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
