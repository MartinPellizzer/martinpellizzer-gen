It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Boymia glabrifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
