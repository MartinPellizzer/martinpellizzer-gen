    "intro": "Bromus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean brome, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Bromus chilensis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
