    "intro": "Bifrenaria wageneri, commonly known as the Bornean fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy. Its leaves are often dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its habitat. Bifrenaria wageneri plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
