    "intro": "Bromus andinus, commonly known as the Andean brome, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Bromus andinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
