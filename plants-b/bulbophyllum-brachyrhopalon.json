    "intro": "Bulbophyllum brachyrhopalon, commonly known as the short-stalked lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic orchid, typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip structure that is shorter than the rest of the floral parts. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
