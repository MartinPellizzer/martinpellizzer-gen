    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidalis var. concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
