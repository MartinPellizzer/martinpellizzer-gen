    "intro": "Betula rosae, commonly known as the rose birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and delicate, finely toothed leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins that are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. Its flowers are typically pink or red, adding a unique visual element to the landscape during the spring. Betula rosae is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
