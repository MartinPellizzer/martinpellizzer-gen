    "intro": "Burbidgea stenantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf burbidgea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Burbidgea stenantha plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
