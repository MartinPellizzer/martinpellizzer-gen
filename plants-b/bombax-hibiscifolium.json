It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
