It is native to the coastal regions of south-eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant often grows in heathlands or dry sclerophyll forests. Boronia deanei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
