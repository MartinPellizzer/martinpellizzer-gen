    "intro": "Bidens hillebrandiana subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the hairy beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small yellow flowers with prominent white veins, typically blooming in the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in moist, sunny environments such as coastal areas and wetlands. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
