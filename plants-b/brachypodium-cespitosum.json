    "intro": "Brachypodium cespitosum, commonly known as false brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology research."
