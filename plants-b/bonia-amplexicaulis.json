    "intro": "Bonia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the hanging ivy or ivy vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that often wrap around supporting structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its ability to climb and trail makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises in ornamental gardening. It thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright, indirect light."
