    "intro": "Brunsvigia lucida, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears several flowers at the top, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps store water. Brunsvigia lucida is well-suited to rock gardens and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice among gardeners."
