    "intro": "Bouteloua arizonica, commonly known as Arizona grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments, making it a common component of desert vegetation. Arizona grass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
