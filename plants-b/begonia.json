    "intro": "Begonia, commonly known as the \"flowering plant\" or \"cape flower,\" is a diverse genus of flowering plants in the family Begoniaceae. It includes over 1,500 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flowers and attractive foliage. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves and showy bracts that often resemble petals. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Begonias are often grown as houseplants or in gardens, thriving in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade."
