    "intro": "Bupleurum pyrenaeum var. lancifolium, commonly known as the Pyrenean angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features a robust root system and has lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
