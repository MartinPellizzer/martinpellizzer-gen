    "intro": "Butia marmorii, commonly known as the marble palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that eventually develop into dark blue, edible fruits. Its unique, mottled trunk pattern resembles marble, hence its common name. Butia marmorii is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
