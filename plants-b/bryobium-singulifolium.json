    "intro": "Bryobium singulifolium, commonly known as the single-leaf bryobium, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Ptychoglossaceae. It is characterized by its singular, elongated leaf that resembles a blade, often growing directly from the base of the plant. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along the edges of streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, consisting of tiny spore-producing capsules. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
