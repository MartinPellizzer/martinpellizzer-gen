    "intro": "Bartsia alpina var. jensenii, commonly known as the alpine bartsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
