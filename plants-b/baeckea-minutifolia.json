    "intro": "Baeckea minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved baeckea, is a small shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Baeckea minutifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate light coastal exposure."
