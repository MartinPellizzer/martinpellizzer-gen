It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in open grassland habitats. It has small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
