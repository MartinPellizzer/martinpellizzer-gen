    "intro": "Bromus trinii var. pallidiflorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered brome, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, pale florets. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The pale coloration of its flowers is a distinguishing characteristic of this variety."
