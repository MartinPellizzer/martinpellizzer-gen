    "intro": "Biscutella apula var. megacarpaea, commonly known as the Apulian biscuit plant, is a rare Mediterranean species belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
