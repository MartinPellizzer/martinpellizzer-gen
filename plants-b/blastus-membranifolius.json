    "intro": "Blastus membranifolius, commonly known as the membranous-leaf blastus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
