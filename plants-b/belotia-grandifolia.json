    "intro": "Belotia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved belotia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Belotia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
