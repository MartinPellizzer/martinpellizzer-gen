    "intro": "Brownanthus arenosus, commonly known as the sandflower, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a dense tuft. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots for moisture absorption. Brownanthus arenosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
