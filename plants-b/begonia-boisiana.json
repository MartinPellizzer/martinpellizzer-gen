    "intro": "Begonia boisiana, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Begonia boisiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
