It is native to Southeast Asia and includes species such as Brainea insignis and Brainea latifolia. These plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Brainea species are valued for their ornamental qualities and have cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
