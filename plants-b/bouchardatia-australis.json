It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
