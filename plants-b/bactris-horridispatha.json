    "intro": "Bactris horridispatha, commonly known as the spiny wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in short, stiff spines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, fibrous fruits. Its trunk is typically short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. Bactris horridispatha is well adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat."
