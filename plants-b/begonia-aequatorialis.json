    "intro": "Begonia aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white, often with intricate patterns. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia aequatorialis is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
