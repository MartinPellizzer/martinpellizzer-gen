It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Bolanthus aziz-sancarii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
