    "intro": "Bracteantha palustris, commonly known as the swamp bracteantha, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its bracts, which are modified leaves, are brightly colored and serve to attract pollinators. Bracteantha palustris thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies."
