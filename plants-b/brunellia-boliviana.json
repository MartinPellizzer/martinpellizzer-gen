    "intro": "Brunellia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian sycamore, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
