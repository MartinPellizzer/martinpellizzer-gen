    "intro": "Berberis antucoana, commonly known as the Antucoa barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain animals. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
