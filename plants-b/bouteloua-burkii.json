    "intro": "Bouteloua burkii, commonly known as Burk's bluestem, is a native grass species found primarily in the southern United States. It is a warm-season perennial grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. The plant produces dense, tufted clumps with narrow, blue-green blades that turn golden in the fall. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Burk's bluestem is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
