    "intro": "Bistorta bistortoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
