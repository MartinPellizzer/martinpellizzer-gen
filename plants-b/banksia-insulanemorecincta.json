    "intro": "Banksia insulanemorecincta, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Banksia, is an endemic species native to the island of Tasmania. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
