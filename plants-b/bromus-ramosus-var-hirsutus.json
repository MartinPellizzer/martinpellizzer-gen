    "intro": "Bromus ramosus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus ramosus var. hirsutus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
