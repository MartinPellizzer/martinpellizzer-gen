    "intro": "Bothriochloa ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Bothriochloa ambigua is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense stands."
