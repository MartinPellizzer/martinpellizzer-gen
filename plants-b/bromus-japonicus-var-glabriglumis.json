    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. glabriglumis, commonly known as Japanese false brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow with a smooth, waxy surface. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) lemma and palea, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
