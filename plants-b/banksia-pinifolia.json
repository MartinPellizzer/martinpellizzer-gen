    "intro": "Banksia pinifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaved banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stems, giving it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces unique, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are an important nectar source for native bees and birds. Banksia pinifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
