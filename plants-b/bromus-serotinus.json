    "intro": "Bromus serotinus, commonly known as winter grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically flowers in late summer to early autumn, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Bromus serotinus thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas."
