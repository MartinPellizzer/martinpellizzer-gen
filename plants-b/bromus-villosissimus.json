    "intro": "Bromus villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Bromus villosissimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
