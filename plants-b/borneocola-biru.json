    "intro": "Borneocola biru, commonly known as the blue bearberry, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has evergreen leaves that are leathery and dark green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Borneocola biru is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
