    "intro": "Balanites aegyptiaca var. indica, commonly known as the Indian date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits that contain a single large seed. The fruit is edible when ripe and has a sweet, mealy texture similar to dates. It is also valued for its hard, heavy wood and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
