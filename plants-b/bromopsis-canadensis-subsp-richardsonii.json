    "intro": "Bromopsis canadensis subsp. richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's bluebunch bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats. Bromopsis canadensis subsp. richardsonii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
