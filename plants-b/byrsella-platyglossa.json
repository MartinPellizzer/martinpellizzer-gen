    "intro": "Byrsella platyglossa, commonly known as the flat-tongued orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, flat, tongue-shaped petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and often clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Byrsella platyglossa is considered a vulnerable species."
