    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cauliflorum, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a cauliflower due to its dense cluster of small, white flowers. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
