    "intro": "Bassia obliquicuspis, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems with distinctive, zigzagging leaf arrangements. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
