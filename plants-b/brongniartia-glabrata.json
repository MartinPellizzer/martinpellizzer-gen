    "intro": "Brongniartia glabrata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in woodworking, Brongniartia glabrata has been heavily exploited, leading to its classification as an endangered species."
