    "intro": "Biotia schreberi, commonly known as the Schreber's biotia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flattened, leaf-like body that is usually green or reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced on the upper surface of the thallus and are used for asexual propagation. Biotia schreberi is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of the understory vegetation in humid ecosystems."
