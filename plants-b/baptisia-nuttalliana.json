It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces long, cylindrical seedpods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Baptisia nuttalliana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
