    "intro": "Betula utilis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and green beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are oval and serrated, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
