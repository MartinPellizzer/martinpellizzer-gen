    "intro": "Betula alba var. aetherea, commonly known as the silver birch variant, is a less commonly documented subspecies of the white birch. It is characterized by its slender, pale bark that often displays a distinctive flaky texture. The leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and a light green upper surface. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in temperate climates. Due to its rarity, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists."
