    "intro": "Bauhinia involucellata, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling flames, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are alternate and often shed during the dry season. Its flowers are typically borne on racemose inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Bauhinia involucellata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
