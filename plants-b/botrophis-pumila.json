    "intro": "Botrophis pumila, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is a carnivorous species, relying on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water. Botrophis pumila typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
