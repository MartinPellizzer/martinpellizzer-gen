    "intro": "Brunellia integrifolia var. ptariana, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features dense, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically entire, giving it a lush, foliage-rich appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
