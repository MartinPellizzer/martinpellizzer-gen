    "intro": "Begonia rupicola, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
