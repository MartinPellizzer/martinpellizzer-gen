It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from dark green to deep purple. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, often with contrasting yellow markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
