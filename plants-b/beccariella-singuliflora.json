    "intro": "Beccariella singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flowered beccariella, is a rare and unusual plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant produces a single, striking flower at the tip of its stem, which is surrounded by specialized bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
