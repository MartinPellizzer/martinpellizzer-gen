    "intro": "Biophytum petersianum, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
