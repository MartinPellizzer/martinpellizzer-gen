It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. It is often found in disturbed sites and can be an indicator of wetland or riparian environments."
