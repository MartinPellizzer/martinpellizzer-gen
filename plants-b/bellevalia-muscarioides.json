    "intro": "Bellevalia muscarioides, commonly known as the musk lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and producing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. The flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its strong, musky fragrance, which is most pronounced when the flowers are in full bloom. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
