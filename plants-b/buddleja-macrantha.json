    "intro": "Buddleja macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered bush willow, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Buddleja macrantha thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
