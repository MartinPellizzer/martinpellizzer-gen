    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, oval, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its slow growth rate and ability to tolerate pruning make it ideal for shaping into topiaries or borders."
