It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often fragrant and exhibit a complex morphology typical of orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
