It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Native American herbal practices."
