    "intro": "Bulbophyllum zenkerianum, commonly known as the Zenker's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
