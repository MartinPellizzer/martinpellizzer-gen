    "intro": "Baccharis elaeoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Baccharis elaeoides is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in some Native American medicinal practices."
