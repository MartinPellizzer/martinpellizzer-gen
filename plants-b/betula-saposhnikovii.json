    "intro": "Betula saposhnikovii, commonly known as the Korean birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with doubly serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
