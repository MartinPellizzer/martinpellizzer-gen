    "intro": "Berberis orthobotrys var. conwayi, commonly known as the Conway's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features thorny stems and small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
