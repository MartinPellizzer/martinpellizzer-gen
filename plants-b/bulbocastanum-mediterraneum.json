    "intro": "Bulbocastanum mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean bulbous chestnut, is a rare and elusive plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive bulb-like structure, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces small, spiky flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a specific climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
