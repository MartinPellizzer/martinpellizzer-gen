    "intro": "Bertya lapicola subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bertya, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
