    "intro": "Bolbitis nakaii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Bolbitis nakaii is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
