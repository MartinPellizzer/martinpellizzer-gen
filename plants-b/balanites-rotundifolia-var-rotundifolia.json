    "intro": "Balanites rotundifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and smooth, pale bark that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain a milky latex sap. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant's ability to thrive in drought conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
