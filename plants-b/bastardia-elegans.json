    "intro": "Bastardia elegans, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. Its structure is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a hardy species. Bastardia elegans is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
