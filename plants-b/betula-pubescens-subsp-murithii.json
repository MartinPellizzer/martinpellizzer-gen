    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. murithii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a subspecies of the white birch native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of short, white hairs. The tree produces small, clustered yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in cold climates with well-drained soils. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions."
