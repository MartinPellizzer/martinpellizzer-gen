It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its rough, bristly stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, allowing them to be dispersed by wind. Bidens involvens is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
