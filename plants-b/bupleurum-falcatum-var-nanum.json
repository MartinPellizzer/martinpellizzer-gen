    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf cat's ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to gardens with limited space."
