    "intro": "Baliospermum axillare var. dioicum, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
