    "intro": "Bromus baumgartenii, commonly known as the Baumann's brome, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of South America. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered along the stem. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is adapted to survive in cold, harsh climates. Bromus baumgartenii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
