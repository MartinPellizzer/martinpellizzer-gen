    "intro": "Bulbophyllum anakbaruppui, commonly known as the Anakbaruppui orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of northeastern India. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
