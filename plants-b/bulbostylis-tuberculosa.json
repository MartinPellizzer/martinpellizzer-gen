    "intro": "Bulbostylis tuberculosa, commonly known as the knobbed bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
