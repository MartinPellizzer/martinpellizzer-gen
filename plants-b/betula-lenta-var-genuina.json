    "intro": "Betula lenta var. genuina, commonly known as the edible birch or sweet birch, is a variant of the yellow birch native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that often develops fissures with age. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its most notable feature is the sweet, aromatic scent of its bark, which contains high levels of methyl salicylate. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of birch syrup."
