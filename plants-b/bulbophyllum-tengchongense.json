    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tengchongense, commonly known as the Tengchong orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
