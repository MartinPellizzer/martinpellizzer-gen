    "intro": "Bulbophyllum forsythianum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like stems and its ability to store water, which helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
