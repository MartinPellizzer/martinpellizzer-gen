    "intro": "Bidens fusca, commonly known as yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens fusca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
