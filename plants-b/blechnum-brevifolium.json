    "intro": "Blechnum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, low-growing appearance."
