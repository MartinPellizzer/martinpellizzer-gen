It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and elongated, woody pods that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with several small leaflets arranged along a central axis. Bufonia calyculata is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties."
