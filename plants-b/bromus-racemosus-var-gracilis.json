    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
