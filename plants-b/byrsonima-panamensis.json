    "intro": "Byrsonima panamensis, commonly known as the Panama rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
