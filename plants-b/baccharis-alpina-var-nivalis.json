    "intro": "Baccharis alpina var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects the harsh alpine environment. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats to prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens in cooler climates."
