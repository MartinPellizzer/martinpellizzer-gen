    "intro": "Biophytum dormiens, commonly known as the sleeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and unique leaf structure that folds shut at night, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its dormancy mechanism is an adaptation to conserve energy and protect itself from nocturnal herbivores."
