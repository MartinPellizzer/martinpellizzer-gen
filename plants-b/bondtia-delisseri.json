It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
