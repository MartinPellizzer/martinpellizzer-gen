    "intro": "Banisteriopsis martiniana var. subenervia, commonly known as the Amazonian arrow poison. It is a woody vine native to the rainforests of South America, particularly the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with a distinctive sub-veined pattern. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids in its sap, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting purposes. The plant's morphology and chemical composition make it a subject of interest in both ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
