    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Boerlagiodendron species produce small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy fruits. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
