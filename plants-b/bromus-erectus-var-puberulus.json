    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. puberulus, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of spikelets, each containing several small, awned lemmas. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
