    "intro": "Baccharis arbutifolia var. arbutifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the fall, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along waterways, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant in coastal and riparian areas."
