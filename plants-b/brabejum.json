    "intro": "Brabejum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats. The plants are characterized by their small, leathery leaves and showy, pale pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. Brabejum species are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are also cultivated for horticultural purposes."
