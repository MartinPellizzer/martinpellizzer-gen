    "intro": "Borreria suberecta var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid borreria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. This species is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
