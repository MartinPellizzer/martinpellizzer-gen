    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dasystachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces striking, elongated inflorescences with numerous small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. Its bulbs are an important feature, serving as storage organs for nutrients and water. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
