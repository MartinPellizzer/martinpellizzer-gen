It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically armed with spines. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
