    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. exaltatum, commonly known as the tall cowparsley, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with finely toothed margins, and are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
