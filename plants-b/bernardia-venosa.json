    "intro": "Bernardia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark green, velvety leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique foliage."
