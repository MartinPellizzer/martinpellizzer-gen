    "intro": "Bombax oleagineum, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom in the rainy season. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The plant is also valued for its durable fibers, which have been used historically in textiles and for making ropes."
