    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. purgans, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowering spikes are usually small and borne at the base of the plant. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
