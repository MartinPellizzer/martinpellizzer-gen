    "intro": "Brachypodium flexum, commonly known as false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Brachypodium flexum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it a valuable model organism in plant genetics and agricultural research."
