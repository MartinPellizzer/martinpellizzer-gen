    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sarcochilum, commonly known as the black root orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy pseudobulbs and dark, almost black roots, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Bulbophyllum sarcochilum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and ease of cultivation."
