    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cuspidilingue, commonly known as the pointed-lip orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive lip that is typically pointed or elongated. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in shaded, tropical conditions. The orchid's botanical features make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
