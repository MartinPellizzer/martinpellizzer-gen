    "intro": "Briza uniolae, commonly known as the water veldtgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble those of other briza species. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and riverbanks. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and they bloom from late summer to autumn. Briza uniolae is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants in its native environment."
