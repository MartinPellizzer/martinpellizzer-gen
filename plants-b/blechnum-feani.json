It is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds dying back each year and new ones emerging from the rhizome. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
