    "intro": "Begonia modica, commonly known as the Modica begonia, is a species native to the island of Sicily. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Begonia modica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
