    "intro": "Biscutella arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernes bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the French Pyrenees. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
