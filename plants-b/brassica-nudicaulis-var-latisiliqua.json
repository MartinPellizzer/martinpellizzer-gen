    "intro": "Brassica nudicaulis var. latisiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaved winter cress, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces round, green pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. This species is also known for its peppery flavor, making it a traditional ingredient in some cuisines."
