    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 kusmisscheffii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula jacquemontii (Kusmi's birch). It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Central Asia but has been introduced to various parts of Europe and North America. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Betula \u00d7 kusmisscheffii is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
