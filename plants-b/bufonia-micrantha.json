It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, dark green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bufonia micrantha is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
