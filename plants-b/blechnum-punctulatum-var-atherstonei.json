    "intro": "Blechnum punctulatum var. atherstonei, commonly known as the Atherstone's hart's-tongue fern, is a variety of the hart's-tongue fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, and evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant has a compact growth habit and forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its fronds are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
