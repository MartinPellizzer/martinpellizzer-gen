    "intro": "Buxus harlandii var. cephalantha, commonly known as the Harland's boxwood variety cephalantha, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a fine, glossy texture, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in moist, cool environments. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
