    "intro": "Bubon gummiferum, commonly known as the gum tree, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and often flaky bark that exudes a sticky resin. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. The gum produced by this plant has been historically used for various traditional and industrial purposes."
