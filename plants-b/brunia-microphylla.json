    "intro": "Brunia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf buchu, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Brunia microphylla thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact size and fragrant foliage."
