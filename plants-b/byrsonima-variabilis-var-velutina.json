    "intro": "Byrsonima variabilis var. velutina, commonly known as velvet soursop, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green, inedible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it is pollinated by insects. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests."
