    "intro": "Blechnum glabrescens, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
