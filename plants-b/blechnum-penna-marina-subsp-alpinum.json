    "intro": "Blechnum penna-marina subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, tongue-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
