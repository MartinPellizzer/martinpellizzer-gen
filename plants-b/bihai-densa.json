    "intro": "Bihai densa, commonly known as the dense hibiscus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a houseplant. Bihai densa is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the year under optimal conditions."
