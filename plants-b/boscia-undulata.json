    "intro": "Boscia undulata, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in drought conditions. Boscia undulata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
