    "intro": "Bathmium heracleifolium, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
