    "intro": "Bletia gloriosa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish sepals that contrast with its vibrant floral display. Bletia gloriosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
