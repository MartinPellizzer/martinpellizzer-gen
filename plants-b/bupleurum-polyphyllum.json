    "intro": "Bupleurum polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features a tall, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensively branched and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Bupleurum polyphyllum thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment."
