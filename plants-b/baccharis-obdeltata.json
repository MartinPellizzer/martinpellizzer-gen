    "intro": "Baccharis obdeltata, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
