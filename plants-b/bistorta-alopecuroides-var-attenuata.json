It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dark green, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and modest blooms."
