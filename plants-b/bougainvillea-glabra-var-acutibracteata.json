    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra var. acutibracteata, commonly known as the sharp-bract bougainvillea, is a tropical flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers inside the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to flourish. This variety is popular in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to climb or be trained into shapes."
