    "intro": "Banksia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flower spikes, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia occidentalis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
