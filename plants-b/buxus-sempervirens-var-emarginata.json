    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. emarginata, commonly known as the margined boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage with distinctive white or pale green margins on the leaves. The plant typically grows in a rounded shape, making it a popular choice for topiary and formal garden designs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is highly resistant to pests and diseases."
