    "intro": "Bassia butyraceoides, commonly known as the buttercup grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments. Bassia butyraceoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
