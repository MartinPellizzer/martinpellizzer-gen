    "intro": "Bigelowia ramulosa, commonly known as the slender bigelowia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and salty air. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bigelowia ramulosa is often found in open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
