    "intro": "Byrsonima viminifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic species in ecological management."
