    "intro": "Biota orientalis var. filiformis-erecta, commonly known as the upright filiform biota, is a distinctive plant species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. It features finely divided, grass-like leaves that give it a delicate, almost feathery appearance. This variant is native to specific regions in Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical structure makes it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
