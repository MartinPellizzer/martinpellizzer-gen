    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. aristatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, pale green to brownish spikelets. This variety is characterized by its distinctive awned lemma, which gives it its scientific name \"aristatus.\""
