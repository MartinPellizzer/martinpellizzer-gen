    "intro": "Billbergia debilis, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking pink bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped arrangement of sword-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports various microorganisms. Billbergia debilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
