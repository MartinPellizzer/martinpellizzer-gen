    "intro": "Begonia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican begonia, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often variegated, adding visual interest, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
