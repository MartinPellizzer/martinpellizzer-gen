    "intro": "[WRONG START] Barrera capensis, commonly known as the Cape barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Barreria capensis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils."
