    "intro": "Bidens vulgata, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 centimeters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, followed by distinctive bristled seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
