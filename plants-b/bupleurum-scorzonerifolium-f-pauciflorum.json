    "intro": "Bupleurum scorzonerifolium f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the Alpine angelica, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
