    "intro": "Besleria spissa, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
