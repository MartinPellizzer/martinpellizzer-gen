    "intro": "Blastus lyi, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Blastus lyi is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
