    "intro": "Blechnum unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are asymmetrical, with one side of the leaf blade being significantly longer than the other. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which helps it establish in various soil types. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded sori on the underside of the leaves."
