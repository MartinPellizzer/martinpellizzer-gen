It is characterized by its unique, curved leaf shape and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination."
