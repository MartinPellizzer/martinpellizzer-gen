    "intro": "Browningia icaensis, commonly known as the Ica browningia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Browningia icaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
