    "intro": "Boothia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, often toxic, arrow-shaped leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. Boothia species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to their toxic properties, they are often avoided by herbivores and can be challenging to cultivate in gardens."
