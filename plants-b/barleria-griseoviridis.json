    "intro": "Barleria griseoviridis, commonly known as the silver leaf barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
