    "intro": "Bulbophyllum minax, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Bulbophyllum minax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
