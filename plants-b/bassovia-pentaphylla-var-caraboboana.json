It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by winged, elliptical seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
