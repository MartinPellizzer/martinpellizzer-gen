    "intro": "Berchemia crenulata, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Berchemia crenulata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
