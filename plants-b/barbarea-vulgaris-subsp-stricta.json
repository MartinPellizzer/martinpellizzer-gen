    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris subsp. stricta, commonly known as rock chickweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, seed-containing pods. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
