    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tapirus, commonly known as the tapir orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that resemble the snout of a tapir, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with dark markings, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
