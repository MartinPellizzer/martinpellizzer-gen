    "intro": "Bactris major var. major, commonly known as the pink pineapple. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces a striking inflorescence with pinkish-red flowers, which eventually give way to edible, spiky fruits. This species is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential as a food source in its native habitat."
