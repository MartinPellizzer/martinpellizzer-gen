    "intro": "Biscutella longifolia subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
