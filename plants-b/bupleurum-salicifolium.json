    "intro": "Bupleurum salicifolium, commonly known as narrow-leafed peavine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a distinctive silvery-green appearance due to their hairy surface. Bupleurum salicifolium is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
