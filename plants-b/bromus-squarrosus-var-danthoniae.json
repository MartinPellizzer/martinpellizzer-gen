    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. danthoniae, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming sod-like mats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with awned lemmas that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
