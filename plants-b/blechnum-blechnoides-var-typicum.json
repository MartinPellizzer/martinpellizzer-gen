    "intro": "Blechnum blechnoides var. typicum, commonly known as the typical holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal form typicum is distinguished by its consistent morphology compared to other varieties of Blechnum blechnoides."
