    "intro": "Borassus gomutus, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, fan-shaped palm native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, umbrella-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous fruits, which are used for their starchy pulp. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
