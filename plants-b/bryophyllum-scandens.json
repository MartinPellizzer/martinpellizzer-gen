    "intro": "Bryophyllum scandens, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the presence of rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Bryophyllum scandens reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its simple yet efficient botanical features make it an important component of wetland and forest ecosystems."
