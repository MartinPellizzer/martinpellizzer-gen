    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rubiferum, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a deep red or purple hue along the veins. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with red markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
