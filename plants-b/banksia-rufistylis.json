    "intro": "Banksia rufistylis, commonly known as the red-styled banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has woody, cylindrical cones that remain on the plant for many years, contributing to its unique appearance. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Banksia rufistylis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife."
