    "intro": "Bidens chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean ironweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its upright stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with dark centers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Bidens chilensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
