    "intro": "Begonia nigrovenia, commonly known as the black velvet begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves that range from deep black to dark green, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, often with a contrasting throat color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant enthusiasts."
