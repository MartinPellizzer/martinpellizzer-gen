    "intro": "Baptisia minor var. aberrans, commonly known as the dwarf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its clusters of blue to bluish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots are known to produce a yellow pigment called canthaxanthin. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. This variety is less common than other Baptisia species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
