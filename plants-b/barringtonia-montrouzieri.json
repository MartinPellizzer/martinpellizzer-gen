It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a buttressed trunk and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces distinctive white, candle-like flowers that are fragrant and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a fibrous capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
