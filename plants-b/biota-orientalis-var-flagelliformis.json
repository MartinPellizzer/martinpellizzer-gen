Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, sometimes with a slight variegation, and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant is known for its ability to climb or trail, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
