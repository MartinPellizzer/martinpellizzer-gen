    "intro": "Bahia multiflora, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and resistant to salt spray, making it well-suited for erosion control. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for wildlife."
