    "intro": "Bromus bikfayensis, commonly known as the Bikfay grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Ethiopian Highlands, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms during the cooler months of the year. Bromus bikfayensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh, mountainous environment."
