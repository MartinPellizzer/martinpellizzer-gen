    "intro": "Bromus frigidus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus frigidus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
