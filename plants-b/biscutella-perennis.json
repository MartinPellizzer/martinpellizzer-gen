    "intro": "Biscutella perennis, commonly known as the perennial biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant features a thick, fleshy root system that allows it to survive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Biscutella perennis produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
