    "intro": "Begonia confinis, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, colorful flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
