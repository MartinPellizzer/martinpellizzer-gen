    "intro": "Bocagea polycarpa, commonly known as the Florida starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by star-shaped, yellow fruits. The fruits are edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as the tropical starfruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites."
