    "intro": "Baccharis macrocephala, commonly known as wax myrtle or sweet myrtle, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. Its berries are typically dark blue to black and are an important food source for birds. Baccharis macrocephala is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along waterways."
