    "intro": "Bromus japonicus f. diffusus, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
