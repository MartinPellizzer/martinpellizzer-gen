    "intro": "Bidens heterodoxa, commonly known as the common beggar\u2019s ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are easily carried by wind or water. Bidens heterodoxa is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
