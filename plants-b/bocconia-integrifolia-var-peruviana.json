    "intro": "Bocconia integrifolia var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bocconia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its stems are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps to retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
