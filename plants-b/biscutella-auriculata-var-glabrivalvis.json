    "intro": "Biscutella auriculata var. glabrivalvis, commonly known as the smooth-valved biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrivalvis has reduced pubescence on the lower leaf surfaces. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value."
