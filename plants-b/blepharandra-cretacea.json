    "intro": "Blepharandra cretacea, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Blepharandra cretacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
