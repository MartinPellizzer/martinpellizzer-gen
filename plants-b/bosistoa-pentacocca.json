It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with five lobes, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
