    "intro": "Brackenridgea denticulata, commonly known as the toothed brackenridgea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and palmately lobed leaves with serrated edges. Its showy, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences and bloom in the spring. Brackenridgea denticulata is often found in open woods and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
