It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along its twining stems. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Bignonia melioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a shade provider in tropical landscapes."
