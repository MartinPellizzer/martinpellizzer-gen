    "intro": "Bellevalia zoharyi var. zoharyi, commonly known as the Zohary's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
