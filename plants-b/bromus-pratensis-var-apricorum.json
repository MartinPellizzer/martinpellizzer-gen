    "intro": "Bromus pratensis var. apricorum, commonly known as the spring brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often tinged with a pale yellow or greenish hue. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in temperate climates. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
