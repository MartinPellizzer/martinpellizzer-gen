    "intro": "Balanophora hildebrandtii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of longleaf pine or other hardwoods. The plant produces showy, white, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators. Its small, fleshy leaves are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the host, and it has a complex life cycle that involves a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Balanophora hildebrandtii is listed as an endangered species."
