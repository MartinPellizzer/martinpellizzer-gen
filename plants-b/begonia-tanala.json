It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom during the rainy season.

Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
