    "intro": "Begonia howii, commonly known as the Hawaiian begonia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has smooth, glossy foliage and produces fleshy, tuberous roots that help it survive in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Begonia howii is considered a rare and endangered species."
