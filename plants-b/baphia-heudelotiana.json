    "intro": "Baphia heudelotiana, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often used in agroforestry systems for soil stabilization. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. However, the seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
