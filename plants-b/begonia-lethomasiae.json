    "intro": "Begonia lethomasiae, commonly known as the Lethomas' begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of western Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a deep, glossy green color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
