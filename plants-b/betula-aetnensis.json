    "intro": "Betula aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna birch, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray trunk and pendulous, white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, Betula aetnensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
