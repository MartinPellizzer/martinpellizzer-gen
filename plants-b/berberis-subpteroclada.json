    "intro": "Berberis subpteroclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
