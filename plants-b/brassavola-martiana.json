    "intro": "Brassavola martiana, commonly known as the Martian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow or greenish throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping it retain moisture in its often arid environment. Brassavola martiana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in its native ecosystems."
