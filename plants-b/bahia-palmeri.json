    "intro": "Bahia palmeri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Bahia palmeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
