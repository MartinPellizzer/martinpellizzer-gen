    "intro": "Bastardia crispa, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Bastardia crispa is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in maritime habitats."
