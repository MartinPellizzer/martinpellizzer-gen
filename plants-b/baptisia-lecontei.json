    "intro": "Baptisia lecontei, commonly known as Le Conte's false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces long, cylindrical seedpods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open fields. Baptisia lecontei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
