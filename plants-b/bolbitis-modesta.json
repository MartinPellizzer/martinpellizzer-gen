    "intro": "Bolbitis modesta, commonly known as the modest fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, often growing in shaded, still waters. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and helping it spread across the substrate. Bolbitis modesta is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to create a lush, natural look in water features."
