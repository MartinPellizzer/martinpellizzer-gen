    "intro": "Borodinia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, often blue or purple flowers. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions in southern Africa. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Borodinia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
