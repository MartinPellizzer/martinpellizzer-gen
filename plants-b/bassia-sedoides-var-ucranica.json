It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
