It is characterized by its variable leaf coloration, which can range from green to blue-gray, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike with dense, spikelet clusters. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
