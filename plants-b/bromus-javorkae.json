    "intro": "Bromus javorkae, commonly known as the Javorka brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Bromus javorkae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
