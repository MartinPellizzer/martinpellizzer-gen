    "intro": "Biscutella alpestris, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, linear leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its name derives from the shape of its seed pods, which resemble small biscuits, and its ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Biscutella alpestris is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
