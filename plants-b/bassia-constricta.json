It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its ability to withstand drought makes it a hardy species well adapted to harsh conditions."
