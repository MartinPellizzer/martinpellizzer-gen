It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and indoor plant collections."
