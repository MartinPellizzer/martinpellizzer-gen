    "intro": "Braya oxycarpa var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers clustered in tight inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth form and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of *Braya oxycarpa*."
