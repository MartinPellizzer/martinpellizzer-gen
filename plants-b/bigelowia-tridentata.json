    "intro": "Bigelowia tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed bigelowia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Bigelowia tridentata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
