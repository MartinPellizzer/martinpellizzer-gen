    "intro": "Baccharis pulverulenta, commonly known as sand baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid environments."
