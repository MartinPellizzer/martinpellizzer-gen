    "intro": "Bauhinia angularis, commonly known as the angular bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Bauhinia angularis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
