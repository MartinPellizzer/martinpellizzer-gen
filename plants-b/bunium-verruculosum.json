    "intro": "Bunium verruculosum, commonly known as the rough fennel, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called mericarps, which are covered in tiny, warty protrusions. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Apiaceae family, known for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
