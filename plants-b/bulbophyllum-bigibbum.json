    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bigibbum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
