    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
