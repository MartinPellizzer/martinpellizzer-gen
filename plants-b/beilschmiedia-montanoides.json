    "intro": "Beilschmiedia montanoides, commonly known as the mountain beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Fiji, and Tonga. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds and mammals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many of its native ranges."
