    "intro": "Bomarea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bomarea, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant features a slender, often branching stem with elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers are borne singly at the ends of the stems, making it a visually distinctive species. Bomarea uniflora is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade."
