    "intro": "Begonia engleri, commonly known as the Engler begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant green hues with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
