    "intro": "Bulbophyllum elassonotum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
