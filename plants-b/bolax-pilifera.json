    "intro": "Bolax pilifera, commonly known as the silky bolax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost woolly appearance. Bolax pilifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained conditions."
