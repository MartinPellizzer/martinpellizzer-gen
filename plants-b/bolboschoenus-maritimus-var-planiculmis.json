    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus var. planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life."
