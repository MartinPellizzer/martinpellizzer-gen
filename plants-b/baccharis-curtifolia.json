    "intro": "Baccharis curtifolia, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common component of chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems. The plant also serves as a food source for various insects and birds."
