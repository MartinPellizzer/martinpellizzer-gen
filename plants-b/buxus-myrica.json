    "intro": "Buxus myrica, commonly known as the common boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus myrica is widely cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ability to be shaped into various forms. Its wood is also valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for carving and furniture."
