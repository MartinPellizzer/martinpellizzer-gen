    "intro": "Bulbophyllum incommodum, commonly known as the \"bitter orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that can be either yellow or white in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to trees or rocks in its natural environment. Bulbophyllum incommodum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions."
