    "intro": "Begonia foliosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care."
