    "intro": "Bromus scabridus, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces spikelets that are covered in short, bristly hairs. Its leaves are narrow and rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Bromus scabridus is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
