    "intro": "Bulbophyllum foraminiferum, commonly known as the chambered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of multiple small, fragrant flowers clustered in a dense spike. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for drought resistance. The orchid's flowers are often white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators."
