    "intro": "Bulbophyllum moulmeinense, commonly known as the Moulmein orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
