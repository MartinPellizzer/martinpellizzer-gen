    "intro": "Boopis australis var. hickenii, commonly known as the Hicken's boopis, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of its family, and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
