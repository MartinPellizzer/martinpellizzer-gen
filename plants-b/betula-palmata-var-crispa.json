    "intro": "Betula palmata var. crispa, commonly known as the curly birch, is a variant of the paper birch that exhibits distinctive, wavy leaf margins. This plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and its finely serrated, pale green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, preferring partial to full sun. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, contributing to its unique aesthetic appeal. Betula palmata var. crispa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
