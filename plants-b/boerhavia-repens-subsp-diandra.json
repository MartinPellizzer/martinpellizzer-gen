    "intro": "Boerhavia repens subsp. diandra, commonly known as redroot sandplum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Boerhavia repens subsp. diandra is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
