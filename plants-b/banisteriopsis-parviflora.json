It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy surface. Banisteriopsis parviflora is also known for its potential medicinal properties, although further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
