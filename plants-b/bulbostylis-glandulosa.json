    "intro": "Bulbostylis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, often tufted foliage. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wet or moist soils. Bulbostylis glandulosa is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other wetland habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
