    "intro": "Bromopsis inermis var. aristata, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Bromopsis inermis var. aristata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats."
