It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Blaeria equisetifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
