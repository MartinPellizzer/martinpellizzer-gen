It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, hibiscus-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Bischofia oblongifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
