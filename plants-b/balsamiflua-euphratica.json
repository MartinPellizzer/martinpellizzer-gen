It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance that gives it its balsam-like scent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
