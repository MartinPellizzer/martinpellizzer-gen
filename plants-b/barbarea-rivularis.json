    "intro": "Barbarea rivularis, commonly known as the watercress. This perennial flowering plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, often shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It has slender, branching stems covered in small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Barbarea rivularis is often cultivated for its peppery, edible leaves, which are used in salads and as a garnish."
