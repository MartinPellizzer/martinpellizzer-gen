    "intro": "Brassica spinescens var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock mustard, is a hardy, perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions. It features small, elongated leaves with a distinctive spiny texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
