    "intro": "Blepharidachne, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. They have small, wind-pollinated flowers and produce small, dry fruits called caryopses. Blepharidachne species are generally perennial and play a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
