    "intro": "Burkilliodendron, commonly known as the African sand apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and the production of edible, apple-like fruits. Burkilliodendron species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in dry, sandy soils. The genus is named in honor of the botanist R. F. Burkill, who contributed significantly to the study of African flora."
