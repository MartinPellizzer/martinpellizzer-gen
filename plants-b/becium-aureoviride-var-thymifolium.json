    "intro": "Becium aureoviride var. thymifolium, commonly known as the golden-green becium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking golden-green foliage, which is often speckled with fine, silver-white markings. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the late spring to early summer season. This variant is particularly noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle thyme-like scent, giving it its botanical name."
