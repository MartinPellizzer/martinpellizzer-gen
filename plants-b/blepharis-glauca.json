    "intro": "Blepharis glauca, commonly known as the blue beard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is also known for its ability to bloom profusely during the spring and early summer months."
