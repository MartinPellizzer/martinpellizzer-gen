    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleawn brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments. Its seeds are small and have a hard coat, which allows them to remain viable in the soil for several years. This variety is often considered an invasive species in areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
