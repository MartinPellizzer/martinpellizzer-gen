    "intro": "Begonia peltifolia, commonly known as the shieldleaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among gardeners and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
