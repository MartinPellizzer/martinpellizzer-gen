    "intro": "Balsamorhiza deltoidea, commonly known as the delta balsamroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rough, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Balsamorhiza deltoidea is often found in dry slopes and rocky areas, thriving in full sun."
