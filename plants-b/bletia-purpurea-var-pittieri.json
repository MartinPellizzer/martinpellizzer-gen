    "intro": "Bletia purpurea var. pittieri, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. The flowers are often clustered in racemes and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and wasps."
