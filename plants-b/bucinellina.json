    "intro": "Bucinellina, commonly known as the sea snail, is a genus of small to medium-sized gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Bucinellinidae. These organisms are typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. They possess a spiral shell that is often smooth or slightly ribbed, with a pointed or truncate aperture. Bucinellina species are primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other microscopic organisms. Their ecological role includes contributing to the biodiversity of marine ecosystems and serving as prey for various marine predators."
