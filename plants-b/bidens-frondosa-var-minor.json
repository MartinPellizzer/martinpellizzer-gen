    "intro": "Bidens frondosa var. minor, commonly known as lesser beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with prominent white ray florets, which bloom from late summer to early fall. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as ditches, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
