    "intro": "Brassica incana subsp. incana, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. After flowering, it develops into a dry, wind-dispersed seed capsule, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions around the world."
