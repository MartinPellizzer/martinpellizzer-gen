    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale f. pubirhachis, commonly known as the pubescent harts-tongue fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, narrow, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, finger-like pinnae that give the plant a compact appearance. The underside of the fronds is covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
