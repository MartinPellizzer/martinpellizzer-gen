    "intro": "Biophytum dendroides, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching structure and its ability to produce clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Its growth habit resembles that of a small tree, hence its common name. Biophytum dendroides is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
