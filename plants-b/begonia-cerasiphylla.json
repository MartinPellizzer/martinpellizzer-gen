    "intro": "Begonia cerasiphylla, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a deep red to purple coloration, often with contrasting green veins. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
