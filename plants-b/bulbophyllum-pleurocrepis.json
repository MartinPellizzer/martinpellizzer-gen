    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pleurocrepis, commonly known as the dragon's tongue orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth during dry periods. Its flowers are striking, with long, slender petals and a distinctive spurred lip that attracts pollinators. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
