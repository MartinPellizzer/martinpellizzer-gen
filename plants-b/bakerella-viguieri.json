    "intro": "Bakerella viguieri, commonly known as the red-flowered bakerella, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright red, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Bakerella viguieri is well adapted to acidic soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
