    "intro": "Begonia ocellata, commonly known as the spotted begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that often feature intricate patterns of red, purple, and green. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia ocellata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
