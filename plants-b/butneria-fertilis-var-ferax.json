    "intro": "Butneria fertilis var. ferax, commonly known as the fertilis ferax variant, is a lesser-known species within the Butneria genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which are typical of many species in the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited cultivation and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in botanical collections."
