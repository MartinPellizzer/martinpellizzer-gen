It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its berries are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
