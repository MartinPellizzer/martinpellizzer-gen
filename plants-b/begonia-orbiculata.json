    "intro": "Begonia orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or round in shape, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to gardens and collections."
