    "intro": "Balanophora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are fully mycoheterotrophic, meaning they derive all their nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. They lack chlorophyll and are typically found in shaded, moist forest environments. Balanophora species have reduced leaves and rely entirely on symbiotic relationships with specific fungal networks. Their flowers are often fragrant and attract insects for pollination."
