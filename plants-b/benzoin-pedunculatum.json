    "intro": "Benzoin pedunculatum, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or fragrant gum tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the secretion of a fragrant resin, which is harvested for its aromatic properties. This resin, known as benzoin, is used in perfumery, incense, and traditional medicine."
