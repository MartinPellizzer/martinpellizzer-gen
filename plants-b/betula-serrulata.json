    "intro": "Betula serrulata, commonly known as the serrated birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
