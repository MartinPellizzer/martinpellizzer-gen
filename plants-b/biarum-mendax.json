    "intro": "Biarum mendax, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and livestock, making it important to handle with care. Biarum mendax thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive yet potentially dangerous plant in its native habitat."
