    "intro": "Baccaurea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sugar-apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor, while the seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in tropical regions."
