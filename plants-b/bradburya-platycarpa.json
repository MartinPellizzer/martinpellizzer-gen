    "intro": "Bradburya platycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit bradburya, is a rare and unique species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a dry, ribbed capsule that matures in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bradburya platycarpa is considered a conservation concern."
