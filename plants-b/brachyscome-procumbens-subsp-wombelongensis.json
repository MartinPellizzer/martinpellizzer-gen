    "intro": "Brachyscome procumbens subsp. wombelongensis, commonly known as the Wombalong daisy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
