    "intro": "Bromus molliformis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Bromus molliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
