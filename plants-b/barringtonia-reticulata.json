    "intro": "Barringtonia reticulata, commonly known as the white candelabra tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like canopy and long, slender branches that give it a striking appearance. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release fibrous, cotton-like seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of fiber."
