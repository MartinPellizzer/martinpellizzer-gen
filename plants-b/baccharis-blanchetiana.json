It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands, and it is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, while its flowers are small and clustered in spherical or conical heads. Baccharis blanchetiana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
