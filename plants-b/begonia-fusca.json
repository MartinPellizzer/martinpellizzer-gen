    "intro": "Begonia fusca, commonly known as the dark begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Begonia fusca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display."
