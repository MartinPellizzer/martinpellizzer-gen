    "intro": "Betula nana var. genuina, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Betula nana var. genuina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic and alpine species."
