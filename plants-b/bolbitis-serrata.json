    "intro": "Bolbitis serrata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds with serrated margins. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. Bolbitis serrata is often used in aquatic gardens and as a decorative element in water features."
