    "intro": "Boronia busselliana, commonly known as Bussell's boronia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 1.5 metres and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its natural habitat and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Boronia busselliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
