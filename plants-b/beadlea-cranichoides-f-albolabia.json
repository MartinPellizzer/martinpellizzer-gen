    "intro": "Beadlea cranichoides f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-labied beadlea, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive white lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
