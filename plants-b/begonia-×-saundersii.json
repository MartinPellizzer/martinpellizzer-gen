    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 saundersii, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a hybrid plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from deep green to shades of red and purple. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its lush, textured leaves rather than its flowers."
