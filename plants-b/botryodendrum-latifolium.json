    "intro": "Botryodendrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf botryodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Botryodendrum latifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
