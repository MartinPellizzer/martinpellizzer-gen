    "intro": "Betula pendula f. cuneata, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a decorative tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like a curtain. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive white to silver color, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This cultivar is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest."
