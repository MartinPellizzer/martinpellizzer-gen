    "intro": "Bulbophyllum alinae, commonly known as the Alina's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
