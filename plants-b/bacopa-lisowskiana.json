    "intro": "Bacopa lisowskiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterhyssop, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Bacopa lisowskiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardens."
