    "intro": "Begonia acaulis, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually broad and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Begonia acaulis is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in containers or as a ground cover in shady gardens."
