    "intro": "Bayonia helicocalyx, commonly known as the spiral-flowered bayonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive helical arrangement of flowers along the stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Bayonia helicocalyx is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
