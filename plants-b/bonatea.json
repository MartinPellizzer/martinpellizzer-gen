    "intro": "Bonatea, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus\" in some regions, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its showy, floating flowers that typically bloom in summer, with vibrant colors ranging from white to pink and red. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Bonatea species are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their cultural and spiritual significance in various traditions."
