It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Bushiola scoparia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
