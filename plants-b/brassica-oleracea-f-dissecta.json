    "intro": "Brassica oleracea f. dissecta, commonly known as the Ornamental Cabbage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, ornamental leaves that resemble a cabbage or fern, with a vibrant color palette ranging from white to purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by siliquae containing seeds. It is typically grown as an ornamental plant for its foliage rather than its edible qualities. Brassica oleracea f. dissecta thrives in cool climates and is often used in garden displays for its visual appeal."
