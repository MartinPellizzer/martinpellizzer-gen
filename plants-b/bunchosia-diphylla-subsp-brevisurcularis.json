It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often borne at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. This species is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
