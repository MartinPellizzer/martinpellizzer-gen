    "intro": "Bikinia letestui, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that store water. The plant has a short, thick trunk with multiple branches, and its leaves are modified into spines to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
