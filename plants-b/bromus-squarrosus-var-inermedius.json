    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. inermedius, commonly known as the intermediate squarrose brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical squarrose brome and other related taxa."
