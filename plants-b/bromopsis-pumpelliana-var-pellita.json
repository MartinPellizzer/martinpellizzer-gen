    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana var. pellita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bromus, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
