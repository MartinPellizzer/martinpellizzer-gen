The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Begonia lucida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
