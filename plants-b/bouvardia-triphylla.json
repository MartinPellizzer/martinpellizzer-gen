    "intro": "Bouvardia triphylla, commonly known as the pink bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant blooms that appear in spring. It is often cultivated as a potted plant due to its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers. Bouvardia triphylla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
