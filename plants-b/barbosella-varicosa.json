It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Barbosella varicosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
