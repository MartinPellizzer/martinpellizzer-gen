    "intro": "Berberis mutabilis, commonly known as the variable barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and alternate, compound leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its adaptability and seasonal color changes make it a visually striking addition to landscapes."
