    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting coloration, with dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, forming intricate inflorescences. Bulbophyllum bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
