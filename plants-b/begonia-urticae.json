    "intro": "Begonia urticae, commonly known as the stinging nettle begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, similar to those found on stinging nettle. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Begonia urticae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
