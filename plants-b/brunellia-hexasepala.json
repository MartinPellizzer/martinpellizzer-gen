It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with six lobes, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals."
