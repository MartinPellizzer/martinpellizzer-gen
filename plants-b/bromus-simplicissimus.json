    "intro": "Bromus simplicissimus, commonly known as the simple brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Bromus simplicissimus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
