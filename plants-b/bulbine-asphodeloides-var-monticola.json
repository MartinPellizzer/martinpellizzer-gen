    "intro": "Bulbine asphodeloides var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain bulbine, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
