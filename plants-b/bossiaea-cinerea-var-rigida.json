    "intro": "Bossiaea cinerea var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or greyish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
