    "intro": "Boerhavia heronensis, commonly known as the heron's bill, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, boat-shaped seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Boerhavia heronensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
