    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. patulus, commonly known as the broad-leaved brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
