    "intro": "Blechnum melanopus, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, almost zigzag appearance along the midrib. The black fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
