    "intro": "Braxireon humile, commonly known as the dwarf braxireon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and they emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Braxireon humile is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
