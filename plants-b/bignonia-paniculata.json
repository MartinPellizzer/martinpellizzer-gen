    "intro": "Bignonia paniculata, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Bignonia paniculata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or structures."
