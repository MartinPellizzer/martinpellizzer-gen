    "intro": "Bulbophyllum noeanum, commonly known as the Noean Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender pseudobulbs and its striking, translucent, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that enhance its ethereal appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
