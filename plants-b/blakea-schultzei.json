    "intro": "Blakea schultzei, commonly known as the red-flowered Blakea, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Blakea schultzei is typically found in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest understory. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
