    "intro": "Bertolonia ulaei, commonly known as the Ulaei flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern South America. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the dry season. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bertolonia ulaei is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
