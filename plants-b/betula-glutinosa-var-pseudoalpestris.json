    "intro": "Betula glutinosa var. pseudoalpestris, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
