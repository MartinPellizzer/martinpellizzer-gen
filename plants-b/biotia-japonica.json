    "intro": "Biotia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese biotia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is usually green to yellow-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Biotia japonica is known for its ability to tolerate environmental stress and is used in traditional medicine in some parts of Asia."
