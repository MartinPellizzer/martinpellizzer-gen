    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum subsp. cespitosum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
