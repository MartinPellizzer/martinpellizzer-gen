    "intro": "Berberis leboensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Ethiopia and parts of Eritrea. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features thorny stems covered in small, yellowish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Berberis leboensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
