    "intro": "Bellis mima, commonly known as the mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Bellis mima is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh mountain climates."
