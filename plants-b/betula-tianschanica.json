    "intro": "Betula tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender trunk and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Betula tianschanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
