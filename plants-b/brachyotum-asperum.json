It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
