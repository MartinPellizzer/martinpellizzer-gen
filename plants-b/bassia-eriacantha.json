It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, drought-prone climates."
