    "intro": "Begonia minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
