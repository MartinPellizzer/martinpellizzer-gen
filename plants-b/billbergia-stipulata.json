    "intro": "Billbergia stipulata, commonly known as the velvet leaf billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a velvety, fibrous coating, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Billbergia stipulata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
