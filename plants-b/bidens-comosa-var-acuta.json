It features slender, branching stems that often grow in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets that bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
