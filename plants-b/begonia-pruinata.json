It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
