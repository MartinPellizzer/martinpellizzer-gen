    "intro": "Bertya gummifera var. psiloclada, commonly known as the psiloclada variant of the gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal or disturbed soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
