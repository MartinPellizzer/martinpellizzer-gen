    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 aurata, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that exhibits distinctive silvery-white, cascading branches. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn golden in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling to reveal a contrasting white or pinkish inner layer. Betula \u00d7 aurata is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its unique, flowing appearance."
