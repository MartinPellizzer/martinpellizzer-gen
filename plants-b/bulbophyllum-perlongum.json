    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perlongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, often attaching to tree trunks or other substrates. The flowers typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
