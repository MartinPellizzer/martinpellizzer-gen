    "intro": "Begonia crassirostris, commonly known as the broad-beaked begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or in shaded forest floors, thriving in humid environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Begonia crassirostris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
