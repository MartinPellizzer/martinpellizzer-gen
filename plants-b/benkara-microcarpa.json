It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
