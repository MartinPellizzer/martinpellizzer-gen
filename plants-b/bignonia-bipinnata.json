    "intro": "Bignonia bipinnata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching. Its most striking feature is its long, drooping clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
