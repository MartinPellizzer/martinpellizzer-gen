It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, orange-yellow fruits. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, barbed hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Bryonia barbata is known for its medicinal properties, though its latex is toxic and requires careful handling."
