    "intro": "Bruguiera eriopetala, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Bruguiera eriopetala is also important in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal protection."
