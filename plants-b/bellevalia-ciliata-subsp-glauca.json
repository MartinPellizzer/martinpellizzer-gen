It features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
