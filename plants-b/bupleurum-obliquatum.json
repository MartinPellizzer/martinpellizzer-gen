    "intro": "Bupleurum obliquatum, commonly known as zigzag valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent. Bupleurum obliquatum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
