    "intro": "Billardiera grandiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant relies on other trees for support and derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can be dispersed by wind or animals. Billardiera grandiflora is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
