It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features tufted culms with ascending to erect growth, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
