    "intro": "Broussonetia, commonly known as the Chinese mulberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, with Broussonetia papyrifera being the most well-known for its fibrous bark. The plant is native to East Asia and is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Broussonetia is often cultivated for its strong, fibrous bark, which has been used historically in papermaking and textile production."
