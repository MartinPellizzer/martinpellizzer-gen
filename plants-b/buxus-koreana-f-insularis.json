    "intro": "Buxus koreana f. insularis, commonly known as the Jeju boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It features dense, dark green foliage that is highly ornamental and often used in horticultural landscapes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that remain glossy throughout the year, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It is typically grown as a foundation plant or in formal garden settings due to its slow growth and ability to maintain a neat shape. Buxus koreana f. insularis is well-suited to mild climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
