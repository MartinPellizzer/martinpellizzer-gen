It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Bromus monostachyus is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
