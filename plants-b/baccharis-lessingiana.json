It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features silver-gray foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Baccharis lessingiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
