    "intro": "Buxus benguellensis var. hirta, commonly known as the Hirta boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat shape make it ideal for topiary and hedging."
