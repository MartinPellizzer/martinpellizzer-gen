    "intro": "Bourreria, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Bourreria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
