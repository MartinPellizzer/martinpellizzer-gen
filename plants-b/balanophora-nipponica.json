    "intro": "Balanophora nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare parasitic plant native to Japan. It belongs to the orchid family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a fleshy, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host plant. It produces small, white or pale green flowers with a unique, intricate structure. Due to its specialized growth habits and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and difficult to cultivate."
