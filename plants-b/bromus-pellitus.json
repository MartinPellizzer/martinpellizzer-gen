    "intro": "Bromus pellitus, commonly known as the purple brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and the presence of dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small and wind-pollinated. Bromus pellitus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
