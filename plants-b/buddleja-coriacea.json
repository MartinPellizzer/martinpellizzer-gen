    "intro": "Buddleja coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf buddleja, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. Buddleja coriacea also attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
