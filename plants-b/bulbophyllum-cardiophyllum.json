    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical climates. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
