    "intro": "Binaria platycalyx, commonly known as the broad-calyx bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its calyx is broad and prominent, often as showy as the petals, giving it its scientific name. Binaria platycalyx thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
