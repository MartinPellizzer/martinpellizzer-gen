    "intro": "Bromelia incarnata, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features a rosette of sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that collect water in a central cup, which is used for storing moisture and supporting small aquatic organisms. Its blooming period typically occurs in the spring or summer, producing striking red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Bromelia incarnata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
