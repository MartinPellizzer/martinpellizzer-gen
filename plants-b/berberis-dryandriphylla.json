    "intro": "Berberis dryandriphylla, commonly known as the dryandra barbed wire bush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
