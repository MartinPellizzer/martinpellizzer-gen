It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Biscutella megacarpaea is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
