    "intro": "Baccharis quadrinervia, commonly known as greenbriar baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its woody stems and persistent foliage make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Baccharis quadrinervia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
