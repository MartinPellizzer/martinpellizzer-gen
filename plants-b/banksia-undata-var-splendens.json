    "intro": "Banksia undata var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Banksia, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces small, woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
