    "intro": "Buglossoides gasparrinii, commonly known as the alpine bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
