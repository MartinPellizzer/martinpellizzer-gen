    "intro": "Bromus molliformis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a common component of disturbed or degraded habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
