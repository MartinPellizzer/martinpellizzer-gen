    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aquinoi, commonly known as the Aquino's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
