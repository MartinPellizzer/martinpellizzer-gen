    "intro": "Baeckea fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered baeckea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded environments. Baeckea fascicularis is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
