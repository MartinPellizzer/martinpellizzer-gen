    "intro": "Bartsia duripilis, commonly known as the rough bartsia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodland or alpine habitats. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and usually have two lips, with the lower lip being more prominent. Bartsia duripilis is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, well-drained environments, making it a characteristic component of high-altitude flora."
