    "intro": "Balanophora coralliformis, commonly known as the coral-forming balanophora, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which results in a pale or whitish appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive coral-like structure that gives it its common name. This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the roots of other vegetation."
