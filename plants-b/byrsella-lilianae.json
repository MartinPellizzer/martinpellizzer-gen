    "intro": "Byrsella lilianae, commonly known as the Lilian's bristly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ornamental species in botanical collections."
