    "intro": "Bacopa neuwiedii, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Bacopa neuwiedii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
