    "intro": "Bistorta longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible parts. The plant features upright, somewhat woody stems that are covered in reddish hairs, and its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a slightly notched base. Bistorta longispicata produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland areas."
