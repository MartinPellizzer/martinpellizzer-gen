    "intro": "Bistorta bulbifera, commonly known as the bulblet bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Bistorta bulbifera is notable for producing bulb-like structures at the base of its stems, which can serve as propagules for new growth."
