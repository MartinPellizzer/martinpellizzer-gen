    "intro": "Bremeria, commonly known as the \"liverworts,\" is a group of non-vascular plants that thrive in moist, shaded environments. These plants are characterized by their simple, often flat, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically rich in chlorophyll. Bremeria species are closely related to mosses and are considered some of the earliest land plants to evolve. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for microorganisms. Due to their small size and lack of true roots, they are often overlooked in ecological studies despite their significance in early plant evolution."
