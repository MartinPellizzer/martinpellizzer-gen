It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming primarily during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Barleria massae is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
