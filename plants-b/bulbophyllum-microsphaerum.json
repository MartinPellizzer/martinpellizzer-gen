    "intro": "Bulbophyllum microsphaerum, commonly known as the miniature globe orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, globular-shaped pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the dry season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
