    "intro": "Bougainvillea stipitata var. stuckertiana, commonly known as the Stuckert's Bougainvillea, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are less showy than the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
