It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
