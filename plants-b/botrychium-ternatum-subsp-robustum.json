    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum subsp. robustum, commonly known as the broadleaf moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky areas, and is found across parts of North America. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This subspecies is notable for its robust growth compared to other members of the Botrychium genus."
