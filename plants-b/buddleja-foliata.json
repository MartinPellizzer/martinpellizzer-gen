    "intro": "Buddleja foliata, commonly known as the silverleaf buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking silvery-gray foliage that contrasts beautifully with its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink blossoms that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja foliata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
