    "intro": "Ballota nigra var. aurea, commonly known as golden ballota, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features hairy, glandular stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their aromatic and slightly bitter properties. The variety 'aurea' is distinguished by its more vibrant foliage compared to the typical form of Ballota nigra."
