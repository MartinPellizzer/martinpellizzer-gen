    "intro": "Bihai harrisiana, commonly known as the harrisiana hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bihai harrisiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
