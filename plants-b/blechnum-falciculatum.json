    "intro": "Blechnum falciculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often recurved and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Blechnum falciculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
