    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a distinctive member of the Brassicaceae family."
