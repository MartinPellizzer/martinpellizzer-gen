    "intro": "Bassia crenata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is used in xeriscaping and as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone environments."
