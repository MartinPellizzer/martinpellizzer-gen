    "intro": "Begonia loranthoides subsp. loranthoides, commonly known as the parasitic begonia, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of red or orange flowers. It is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecosystem by influencing the growth of its host plants."
