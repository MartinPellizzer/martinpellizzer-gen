    "intro": "Buxus obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape, typically measuring 1\u20132 inches in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is prized in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. Buxus obovata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
