    "intro": "Betula odorata, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by clusters of tiny, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula odorata is also known for its aromatic sap, which has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
