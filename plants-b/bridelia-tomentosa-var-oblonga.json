    "intro": "Bridelia tomentosa var. oblonga, commonly known as the woolly bridelia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to oblong in shape, hence the variety name *oblonga*. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
