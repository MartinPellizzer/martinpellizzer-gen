It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs or swampy areas. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine, velvety hair, which helps retain moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
