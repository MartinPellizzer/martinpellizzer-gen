    "intro": "Bernardia monoica, commonly known as the single-flowered bernardia, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardia monoica is considered a vulnerable species."
