It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
