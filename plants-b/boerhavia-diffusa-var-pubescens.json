It features erect, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and often emit a mild, peppery odor. The species is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
