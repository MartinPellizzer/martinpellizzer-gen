    "intro": "Barringtonia rosea, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a distinctive, pendulous inflorescence composed of numerous small white flowers clustered together. Its fruit is a fibrous, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Barringtonia rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
