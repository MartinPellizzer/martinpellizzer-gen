It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squashes. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a rough, green, spiny capsule that contains toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is occasionally studied for its medicinal potential."
