    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tinekeae, commonly known as the Tineke's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from yellow to orange. Bulbophyllum tinekeae is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
