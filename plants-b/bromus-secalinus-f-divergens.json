    "intro": "Bromus secalinus f. divergens, commonly known as the divergent brome, is a variant of the rye brome grass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that usually occurs in late spring to early summer. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphological characteristics compared to the typical form of Bromus secalinus."
