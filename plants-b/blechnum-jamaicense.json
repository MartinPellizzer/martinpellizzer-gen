    "intro": "Blechnum jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, well-drained soils. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
