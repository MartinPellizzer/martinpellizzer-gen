    "intro": "Bulbophyllum psychrophilum, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip structure. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish, including indirect light and well-draining substrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
