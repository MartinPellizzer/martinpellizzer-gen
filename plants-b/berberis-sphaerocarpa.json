It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow-orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance. Berberis sphaerocarpa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
