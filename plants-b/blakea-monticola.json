    "intro": "Blakea monticola, commonly known as the mountain blakea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in humid, montane forests. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It is often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats, thriving in the understory of dense vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Blakea monticola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
