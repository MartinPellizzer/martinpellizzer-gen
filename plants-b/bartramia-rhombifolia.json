    "intro": "Bartramia rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic bracken fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhomboid-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Bartramia rhombifolia plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals."
