    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum, commonly known as woodland false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed soils, it is often found in ecological restoration projects."
