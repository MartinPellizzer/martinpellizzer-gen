    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, two-part fronds that resemble a heart shape, with the upper frond being narrower than the lower one. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the lower frond, a feature typical of the genus Botrychium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
