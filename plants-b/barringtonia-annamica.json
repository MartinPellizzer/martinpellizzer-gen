    "intro": "Barringtonia annamica, commonly known as the white cedar or Annam's glorybower, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a distinctive, pendulous inflorescence that resembles a cluster of candles, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Barringtonia annamica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
