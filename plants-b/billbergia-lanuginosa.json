    "intro": "Billbergia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy trichomes, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Billbergia lanuginosa thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
