    "intro": "Bignonia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, orange-yellow tubular flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
