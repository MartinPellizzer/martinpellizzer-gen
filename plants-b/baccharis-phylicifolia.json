    "intro": "Baccharis phylicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Baccharis phylicifolia is drought-tolerant and has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes by indigenous peoples."
