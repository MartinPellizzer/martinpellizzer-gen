    "intro": "Banksia solandri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cone-like flower heads, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Banksia solandri thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in coastal and heathland environments. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
