    "intro": "Brosimum foetidum, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its rough, dark bark and dense foliage. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor when crushed. Brosimum foetidum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its durable wood."
