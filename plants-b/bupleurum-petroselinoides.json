    "intro": "Bupleurum petroselinoides, commonly known as wild celery or bishop's weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
