    "intro": "Brunonia australis var. simplex, commonly known as the coastal wallaby-jackalberry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, often in areas with strong sea breezes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is often found in shrubland or coastal heath communities. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
