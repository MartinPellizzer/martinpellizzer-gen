    "intro": "Brachyscome microcarpa subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
