    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fraudulentum, commonly known as the deceptive orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in variable conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
