    "intro": "Brasiliorchis rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It typically grows on tree trunks or rock surfaces, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to minimize water loss in its humid yet competitive habitat. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
