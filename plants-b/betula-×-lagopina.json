It is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. The tree is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of yellow and silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun. Betula \u00d7 lagopina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its unique bark and seasonal foliage changes."
