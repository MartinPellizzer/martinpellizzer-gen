    "intro": "Bassia insignis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun with minimal water requirements. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
