    "intro": "Bossiaea endlicheri var. minor, commonly known as the small bossiaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the autumn season, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
