    "intro": "Bulbophyllum laciniatum var. janeirense, commonly known as the Janeirense Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, this variety is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
