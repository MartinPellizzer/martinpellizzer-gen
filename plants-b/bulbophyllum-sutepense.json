    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sutepense, commonly known as the Sutep's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
