    "intro": "Begonia lepida, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display a silvery or white variegation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lepida is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
