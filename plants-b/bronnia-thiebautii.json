    "intro": "Bronnia thiebautii, commonly known as the Thiebaut's bronnia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its glossy, elliptical leaves. Bronnia thiebautii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
