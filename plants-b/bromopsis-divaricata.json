    "intro": "Bromopsis divaricata, commonly known as the variable bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bromopsis divaricata is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils."
