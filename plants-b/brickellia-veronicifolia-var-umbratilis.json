    "intro": "Brickellia veronicifolia var. umbratilis, commonly known as the shadowleaf brickellia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
