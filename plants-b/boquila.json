    "intro": "Boquila, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polemoniaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it cannot perform photosynthesis and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain species of moss, where it grows on the surface of the moss without penetrating its tissues. Boquila is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions of the Americas. Its delicate appearance and unusual growth habits make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
