    "intro": "Brachypodium capillifolium, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium capillifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
