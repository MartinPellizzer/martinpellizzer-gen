    "intro": "Buxus mexicana, commonly known as Mexican boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color, providing a lush, compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is well-suited for hedges and topiary due to its slow growth and ability to maintain shape. Buxus mexicana prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a versatile choice for ornamental gardening."
