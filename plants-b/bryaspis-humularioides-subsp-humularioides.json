    "intro": "Bryaspis humularioides subsp. humularioides, commonly known as the common liverworts, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy structure and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which aid in asexual reproduction. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces. Its morphology includes a thallus that is often dorsiventral, with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces. Bryaspis humularioides subsp. humularioides plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
