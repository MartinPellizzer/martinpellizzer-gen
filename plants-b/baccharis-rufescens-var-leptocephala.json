    "intro": "Baccharis rufescens var. leptocephala, commonly known as narrow-headed baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone regions."
