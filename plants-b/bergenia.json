    "intro": "Bergenia, commonly known as elephant's garlic, is a perennial plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia and is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Bergenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves can be cooked and eaten, making it a versatile plant with both aesthetic and culinary uses."
