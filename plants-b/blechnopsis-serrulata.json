    "intro": "Blechnopsis serrulata, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its fronds are pinnate, with serrated margins that give it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
