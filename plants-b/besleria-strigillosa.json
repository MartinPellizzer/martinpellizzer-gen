    "intro": "Besleria strigillosa, commonly known as the woolly begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with a distinctive waxy coating that gives it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, often with contrasting yellow markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Besleria strigillosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
