It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. This species is often found in moist, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates. It plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
