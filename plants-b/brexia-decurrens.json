    "intro": "Brexia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a sprawling habit with numerous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Brexia decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
