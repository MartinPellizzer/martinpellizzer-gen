    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. limosa, commonly known as the limosa fern, is a variant of the Blechnum capense species native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant a finely divided, lace-like appearance."
