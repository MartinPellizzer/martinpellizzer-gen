    "intro": "Beloperone montana, commonly known as the Montana beloperone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Beloperone montana typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, preferring cool, moist conditions. It is often found in open meadows and forest clearings at high elevations."
