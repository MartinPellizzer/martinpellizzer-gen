    "intro": "Bellevalia stepporum var. transjordanica, commonly known as the Transjordan steppe bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
