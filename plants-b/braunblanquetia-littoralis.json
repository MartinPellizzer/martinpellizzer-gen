    "intro": "Braunblanquetia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal blanquetia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in dune environments and is resistant to salt spray and wind. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
