It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain spiky seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its sap, which is milky and aromatic, has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. Balsamiflua ilicifolia is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in providing habitat for wildlife."
