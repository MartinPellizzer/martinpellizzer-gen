    "intro": "Bromus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with hairy leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Bromus pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
