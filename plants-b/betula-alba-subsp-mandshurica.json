    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. mandshurica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including parts of Russia and China. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions and forest edges. The leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its ornamental value."
