    "intro": "Breynia mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Breynia mollis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
