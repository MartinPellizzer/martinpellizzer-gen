    "intro": "Bromus sterilis f. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous false brome, is a variant of the false brome species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike with spikelets that are tightly pressed together. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
