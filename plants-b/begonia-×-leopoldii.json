    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 leopoldii, commonly known as the leopard begonia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia xerophila. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a variegated pattern of green, white, and red, resembling the spots of a leopard. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in spring and summer. It is a popular ornamental plant, favored for its foliage rather than its flowers. Begonia \u00d7 leopoldii thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
