    "intro": "Begonia polygonata var. longistipulacea, commonly known as the long-stippled begonia, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with prominent veins and stipules, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
