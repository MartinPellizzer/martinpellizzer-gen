    "intro": "Biscutella frutescens, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Biscutella frutescens is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
