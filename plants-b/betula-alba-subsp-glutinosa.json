    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a subspecies of the white birch native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, yellowish-green leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional crafts and medicine."
