    "intro": "Begonia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green, silver, and reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
