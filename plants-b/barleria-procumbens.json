    "intro": "Barleria procumbens, commonly known as red sandalwood or false sandalwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. Barleria procumbens is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control."
