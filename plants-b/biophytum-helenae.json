    "intro": "Biophytum helenae, commonly known as the Helen's ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
