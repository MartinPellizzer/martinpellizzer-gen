    "intro": "Begonia pendens, commonly known as the weeping begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia pendens is often used in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in greenhouses due to its elegant, cascading growth habit."
