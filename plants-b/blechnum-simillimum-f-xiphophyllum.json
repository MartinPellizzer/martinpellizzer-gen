    "intro": "Blechnum simillimum f. xiphophyllum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, and they can grow up to several feet in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
