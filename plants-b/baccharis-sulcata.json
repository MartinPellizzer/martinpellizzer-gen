    "intro": "Baccharis sulcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, appearing in late summer to early fall. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Baccharis sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
