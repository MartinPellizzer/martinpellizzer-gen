    "intro": "Baccharis subpingraea f. punctulata, commonly known as the dotted baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, often sprawling growth habit and small, ovate leaves with distinctive white or pale green spots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. The foliage and flowers are used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for their purported healing properties."
