    "intro": "Brugmansia \u00d7 mollis, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped flowers that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant is known for its fragrant blooms, which are typically white, yellow, or orange, and they open in the evening. Brugmansia \u00d7 mollis is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Brugmansia candida and Brugmansia speciosa. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
