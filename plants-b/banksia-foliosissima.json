    "intro": "Banksia foliosissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a flowering plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, woody cones that develop from its inflorescences. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Banksia foliosissima is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions."
