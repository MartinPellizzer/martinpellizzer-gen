    "intro": "Bikukulla pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with short, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bikukulla pauciflora is considered a vulnerable species."
