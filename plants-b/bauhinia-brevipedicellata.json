    "intro": "Bauhinia brevipedicellata, commonly known as the small-fruited bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, bean-like pods and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Bauhinia brevipedicellata is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
