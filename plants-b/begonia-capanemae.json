    "intro": "Begonia capanemae, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a deep green background with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
