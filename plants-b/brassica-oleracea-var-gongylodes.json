    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes, commonly known as Brussels sprouts, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically forms a short, stocky stem with tightly packed, small, cabbage-like buds along its length. These buds, which are the edible portion, develop in clusters at the base of the plant and mature in the fall. The leaves are dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to the plant's overall robust appearance. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often grown as a winter vegetable."
