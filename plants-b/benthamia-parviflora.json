It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Benthamia parviflora is often found in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
