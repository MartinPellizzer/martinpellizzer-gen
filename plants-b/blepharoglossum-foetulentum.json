    "intro": "Blepharoglossum foetulentum, commonly known as the stinking bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, pitcher-like structures that trap and digest insects. The plant is typically found in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are modified into bladder-like traps that secrete digestive enzymes. The species is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts prey to its trapping structures."
