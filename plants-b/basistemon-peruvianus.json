    "intro": "Basistemon peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
