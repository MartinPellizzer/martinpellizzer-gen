It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by fuzzy, spherical fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage.
