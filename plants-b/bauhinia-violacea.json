It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feathery segments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Bauhinia violacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
