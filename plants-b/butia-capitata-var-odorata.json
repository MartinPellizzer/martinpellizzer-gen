    "intro": "Butia capitata var. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant palm, is a striking ornamental plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, especially during the warmer months. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for smaller garden spaces or container cultivation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid and coastal environments."
