It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It prefers shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
