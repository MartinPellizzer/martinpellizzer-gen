    "intro": "Begonia nyassensis, commonly known as the Nyassan begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and contrasting colors. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
