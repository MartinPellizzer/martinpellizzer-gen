    "intro": "Bulbophyllum boninense, commonly known as the Bonin Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
