    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris var. major, commonly known as the tall narrow-leaf bulbostylis, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale yellow, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its greater height and more elongated leaves."
