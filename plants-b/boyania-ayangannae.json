    "intro": "Boyania ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayangannae fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Boyania ayangannae is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
