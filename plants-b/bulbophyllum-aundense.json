    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aundense, commonly known as the Aundens Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal droughts. The flowers are usually brightly colored, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
