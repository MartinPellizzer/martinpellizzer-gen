    "intro": "Begonia subvillosa, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, tactile texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from spring to summer. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in humid environments, making it a versatile addition to both tropical and temperate gardens."
