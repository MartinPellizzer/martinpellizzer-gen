    "intro": "Beta maritima subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sea beet, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. The plant features lobed leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer. The species is closely related to other Beta species, including the common beet, and is valued for its ornamental and potential culinary uses."
