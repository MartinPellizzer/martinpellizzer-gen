    "intro": "Bruguiera decangulata, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is a small shrub or tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. It has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Bruguiera decangulata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
