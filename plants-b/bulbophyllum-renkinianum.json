    "intro": "Bulbophyllum renkinianum, commonly known as the Renkin's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are often pale yellow or greenish-white with intricate patterns."
