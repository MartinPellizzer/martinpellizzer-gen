    "intro": "Boerhavia maculata, commonly known as inch plant or red wheelbarrow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing annual herb that produces small, vibrant red flowers. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a decorative and sometimes invasive species."
