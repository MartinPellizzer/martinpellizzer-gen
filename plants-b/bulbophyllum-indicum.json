    "intro": "Bulbophyllum indicum, commonly known as the Indian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with irregular rainfall. The flowers are usually arranged in clusters and can bloom multiple times throughout the year under suitable conditions."
