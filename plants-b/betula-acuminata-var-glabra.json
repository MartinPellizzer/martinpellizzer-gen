    "intro": "Betula acuminata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
