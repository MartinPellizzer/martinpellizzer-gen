    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. helvola, commonly known as the downy birch, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are oval with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are found in clusters at the base of the branches. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs or along riverbanks. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) young shoots and its ability to tolerate cold climates."
