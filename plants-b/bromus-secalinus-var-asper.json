    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. asper, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often loosely arranged along the stem. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, with lemmas that are rough and bristly to the touch."
