    "intro": "Byttneria catalpifolia, commonly known as the catalpa tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pendulous white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The catalpa tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
