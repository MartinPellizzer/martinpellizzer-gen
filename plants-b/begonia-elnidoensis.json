    "intro": "Begonia elnidoensis, commonly known as the Elnido begonia, is a rare species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
