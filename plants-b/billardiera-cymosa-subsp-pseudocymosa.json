    "intro": "Billardiera cymosa subsp. pseudocymosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed billardiera, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in cymes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Billardiera cymosa."
