    "intro": "Berberis conferta, commonly known as the dense barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It features prickly, spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
