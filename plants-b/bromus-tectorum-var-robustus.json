    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. robustus, commonly known as cheatgrass, is an annual grass species native to Eurasia but now invasive in many parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant produces a large number of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is highly competitive, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth and flammable seeds, it plays a significant role in increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires in arid and semi-arid regions."
