    "intro": "Bouteloua brachyathera, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in xeriscaping."
