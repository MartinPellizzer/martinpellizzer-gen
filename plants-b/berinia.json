    "intro": "Berinia, commonly known as the common senna, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Berinia species are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. They also play an important role in soil enrichment due to their nitrogen-fixing ability."
