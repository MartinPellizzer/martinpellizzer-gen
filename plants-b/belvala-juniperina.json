    "intro": "Belvala juniperina, commonly known as the dwarf juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Belvala juniperina is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. Its compact form and hardiness make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape plant in cooler regions."
