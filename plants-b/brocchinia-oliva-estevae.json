    "intro": "Brocchinia oliva-estevae, commonly known as the Olive-Esteva brocchinia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, forming a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a striking coloration that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
