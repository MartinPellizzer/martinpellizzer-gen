    "intro": "Briza media var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching inflorescence that moves with the wind, giving it a swaying appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight hairy texture, and the flowers are small, spike-like clusters. It is often used in ornamental gardens for its graceful appearance and is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
