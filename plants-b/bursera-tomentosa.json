    "intro": "Bursera tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, followed by smooth, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Bursera tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
