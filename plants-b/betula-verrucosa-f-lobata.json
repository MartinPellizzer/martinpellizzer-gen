    "intro": "Betula verrucosa f. lobata, commonly known as the warty birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive, warty bark and lobed leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of North America, typically found in boreal forests and open woodlands. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Its bark, which is thick and furrowed, provides a unique texture and is an important feature for identification. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
