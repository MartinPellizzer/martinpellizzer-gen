    "intro": "Bromus gracilis, commonly known as slender brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus gracilis is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
