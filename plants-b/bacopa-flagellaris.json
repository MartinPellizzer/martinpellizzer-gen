    "intro": "Bacopa flagellaris, commonly known as the water bead plant, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that resemble beads, which help it thrive in still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported cognitive benefits. Bacopa flagellaris is widely cultivated in water gardens and is also used as a decorative element in aquatic ecosystems."
