    "intro": "Brassica erosa, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual or biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, toothed, and have a slightly peppery taste, making it a plant of interest in both ecological and culinary contexts."
