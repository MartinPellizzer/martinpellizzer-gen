    "intro": "Bursera covillei, commonly known as the Coville's Bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Bursera covillei is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
