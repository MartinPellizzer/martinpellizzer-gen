    "intro": "Betula austrosichotensis, commonly known as the southern Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves. The tree typically grows in taiga regions, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in reforestation projects in arctic and subarctic environments."
