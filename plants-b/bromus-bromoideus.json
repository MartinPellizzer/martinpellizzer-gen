    "intro": "Bromus bromoideus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Bromus bromoideus is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
