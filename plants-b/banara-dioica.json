    "intro": "Banara dioica, commonly known as the sacred fig or bodhi tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable botanical feature. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree is also culturally significant, particularly in Buddhist traditions, where it is associated with the enlightenment of the Buddha."
