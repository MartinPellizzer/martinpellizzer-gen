    "intro": "Bauhinia purpurea, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a deciduous leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pink or purple flowers that resemble orchids, which bloom in spring and summer. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are trifoliate at the base, and its woody structure makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Bauhinia purpurea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
