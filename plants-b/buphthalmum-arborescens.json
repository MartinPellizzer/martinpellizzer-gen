    "intro": "Buphthalmum arborescens, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
