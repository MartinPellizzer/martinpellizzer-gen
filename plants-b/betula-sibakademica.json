    "intro": "Betula sibakademica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or reddish inner layer, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain triangular seeds, typical of the Betula genus. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic. Betula sibakademica is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and displaying resilience to cold temperatures."
