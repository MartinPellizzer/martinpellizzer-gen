    "intro": "Barringtonia araiorhachis, commonly known as the giant white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The tree has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in coastal environments. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release fibrous seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection."
