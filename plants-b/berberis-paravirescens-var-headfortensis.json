It features thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
