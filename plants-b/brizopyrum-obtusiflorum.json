It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale green to brownish sepals, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Brizopyrum obtusiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
