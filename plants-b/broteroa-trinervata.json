    "intro": "Broteroa trinervata, commonly known as the Trinidadian evergreen or broteroa, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with three veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
