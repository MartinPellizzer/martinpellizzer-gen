    "intro": "Bahiopsis carterae, commonly known as the Carter's feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often described as feathery or plume-like in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dryland gardens."
