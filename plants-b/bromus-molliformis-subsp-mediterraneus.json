    "intro": "Bromus molliformis subsp. mediterraneus, commonly known as the Mediterranean brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils, grasslands, and along coastal areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is well adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
