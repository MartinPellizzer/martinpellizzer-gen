    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pentaneurum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, golden-yellow inflorescence with elongated, spathaceous flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
