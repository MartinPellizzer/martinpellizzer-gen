    "intro": "Brassica napus f. dissecta, commonly known as the cut-leaf cabbage, is a botanical variant of the oilseed rape species. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a sprawling habit that makes it suitable for garden display. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. While primarily grown for its aesthetic value, it is also occasionally used in traditional herbal practices."
