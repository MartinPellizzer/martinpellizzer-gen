    "intro": "Begonia gulongshanensis, commonly known as the Gulongshan begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a rich combination of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
