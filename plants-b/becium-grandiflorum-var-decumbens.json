    "intro": "Becium grandiflorum var. decumbens, commonly known as the dwarf becium, is a low-growing shrub native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its compact form and hardy nature make it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
