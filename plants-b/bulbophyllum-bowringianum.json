    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bowringianum, commonly known as the Bowring's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination."
