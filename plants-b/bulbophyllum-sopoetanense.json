    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sopoetanense, commonly known as the Sopoetan Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
