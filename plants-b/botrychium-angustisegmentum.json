    "intro": "Botrychium angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented moonwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble the shape of a moon, hence its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or near streams. Botrychium angustisegmentum is a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
