    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
