    "intro": "Besenna, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are usually narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often woody and adapted to rocky or arid environments. Besenna species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
