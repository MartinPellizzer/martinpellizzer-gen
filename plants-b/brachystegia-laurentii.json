    "intro": "Brachystegia laurentii, commonly known as the African teak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and Western Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and small, compound leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
