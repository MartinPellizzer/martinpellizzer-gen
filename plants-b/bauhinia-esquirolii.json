    "intro": "Bauhinia esquirolii, commonly known as the flame tree or the red bauhinia, is a tropical plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often shed during drought, and its woody structure allows it to thrive in arid environments. Bauhinia esquirolii is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It also has nitrogen-fixing abilities, contributing to soil enrichment."
