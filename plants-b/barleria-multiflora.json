    "intro": "Barleria multiflora, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or red tubular flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Barleria multiflora is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and rocky garden settings."
