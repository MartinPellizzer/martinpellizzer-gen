    "intro": "Bakeridesia rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined borer, is a species of moth in the family Sphingidae. It is characterized by its distinctive red veins on the wings, which give it its common name. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It plays a role in the ecosystem as both a host plant for its larvae and a food source for various insectivorous animals. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare species."
