    "intro": "Betula tauschii var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The bark is smooth and pale, with a tendency to peel in thin layers, revealing a yellowish or reddish inner bark. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
