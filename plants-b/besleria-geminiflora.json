It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
