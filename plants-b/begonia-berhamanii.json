It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
