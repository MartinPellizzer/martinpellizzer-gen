    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pachyrachis, commonly known as the giant spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized indoor settings."
