    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian flat sedge, is a perennial grass native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
