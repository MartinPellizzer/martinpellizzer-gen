    "intro": "Bauhinia, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are characterized by their distinctive, often palmate or bipinnate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to pink and white. Bauhinia species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season, and many are used in traditional medicine. Some species are also cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking floral display."
