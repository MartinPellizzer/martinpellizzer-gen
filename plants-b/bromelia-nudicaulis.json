    "intro": "Bromelia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bromelia nudicaulis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its relatively low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
