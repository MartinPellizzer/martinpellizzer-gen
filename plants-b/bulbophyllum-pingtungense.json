    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pingtungense, commonly known as the Pingtung orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
