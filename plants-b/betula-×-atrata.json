    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 atrata, commonly known as the black birch or ironwood birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Betula nigra and Betula alleghaniensis. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that is smooth and fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula \u00d7 atrata is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
