    "intro": "Berberis wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red-orange berries that are edible but often have a sharp, astringent taste. Its leaves are typically oval and have a slightly serrated edge. Berberis wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its winter interest and hardy nature."
