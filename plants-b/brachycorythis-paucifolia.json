    "intro": "Brachycorythis paucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
