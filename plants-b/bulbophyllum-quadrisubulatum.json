    "intro": "Bulbophyllum quadrisubulatum, commonly known as the four-branched orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
