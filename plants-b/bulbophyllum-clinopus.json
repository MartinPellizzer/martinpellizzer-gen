    "intro": "Bulbophyllum clinopus, commonly known as the pale-veined orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green with dark veins. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
