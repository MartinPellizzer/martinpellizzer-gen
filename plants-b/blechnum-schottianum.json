    "intro": "Blechnum schottianum, commonly known as the Schott's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, tongue-like shape. The plant grows in rocky or humid environments, often in high-altitude regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in arid conditions. The fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
