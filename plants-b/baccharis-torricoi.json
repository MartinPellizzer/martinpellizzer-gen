    "intro": "Baccharis torricoi, commonly known as Texas baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in arid environments. Baccharis torricoi is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry slopes."
