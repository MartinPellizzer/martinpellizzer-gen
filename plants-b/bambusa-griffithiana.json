    "intro": "Bambusa griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a smooth, green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by triangular, greenish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and structural strength make it valuable for both ornamental and practical uses."
