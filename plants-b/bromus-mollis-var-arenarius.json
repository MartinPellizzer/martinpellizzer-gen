    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry environments."
