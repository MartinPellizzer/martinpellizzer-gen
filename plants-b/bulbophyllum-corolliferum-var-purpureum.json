    "intro": "Bulbophyllum corolliferum var. purpureum, commonly known as the Purple-Flowered Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple petals and a compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its natural habitat. The varietal form, purpureum, is distinguished by its vivid purple coloration, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
