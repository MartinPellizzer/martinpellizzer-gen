    "intro": "Byblis guehoi, commonly known as the Guehoi Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its drooping, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or green, appearing in clusters. Byblis guehoi is a rare and specialized species, adapted to nutrient-poor environments through its unique trapping mechanism."
