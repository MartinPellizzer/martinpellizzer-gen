    "intro": "Bougainvillea spectabilis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-barked bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish bark, distinguishing it from other bougainvillea varieties. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in ornamental gardening for its showy displays and adaptability to container growth."
