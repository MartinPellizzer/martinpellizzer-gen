    "intro": "Bredia amoena var. eglandulata, commonly known as the glandless red bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while the stems are slender and branching. The variety 'eglandulata' is distinguished by the absence of glands on its stems, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Bredia amoena."
