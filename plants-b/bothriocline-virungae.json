    "intro": "Bothriocline virungae, commonly known as the Virunga daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Albertine Rift region of Central Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the high-altitude environments of its native range. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bothriocline virungae is considered a rare and endangered species."
