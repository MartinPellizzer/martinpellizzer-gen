    "intro": "Billbergia lutea, commonly known as the yellow billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow bracts that enclose the inflorescence, giving it a distinctive and eye-catching appearance. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia lutea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and long-lasting floral display."
