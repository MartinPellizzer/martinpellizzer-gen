    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lancilabium, commonly known as the long-labial orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a compact growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its survival in varying conditions. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, with a distinctive elongated labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. Bulbophyllum lancilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivation."
