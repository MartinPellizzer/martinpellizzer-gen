    "intro": "Botrychium oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, club-like structure at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
