    "intro": "Benthamiella intermedia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry soils. Benthamiella intermedia is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
