    "intro": "Brunia elegans, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a popular choice for seaside landscapes."
