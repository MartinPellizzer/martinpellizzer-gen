    "intro": "Brachiaria lorentziana, commonly known as Brazilian grass or Lorentzian grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
