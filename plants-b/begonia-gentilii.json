    "intro": "Begonia gentilii, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features velvety, silver-green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a compact form that makes it suitable for container gardening. Begonia gentilii thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to prevent root rot."
