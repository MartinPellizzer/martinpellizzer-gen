    "intro": "Baccharis erioptera, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and birds. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a valuable plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
