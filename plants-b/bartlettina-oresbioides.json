    "intro": "Bartlettina oresbioides, commonly known as the Oresbioides mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and hickories. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in forest ecosystem dynamics."
