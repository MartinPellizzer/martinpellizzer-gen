    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. incanus, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous short, awned florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native vegetation."
