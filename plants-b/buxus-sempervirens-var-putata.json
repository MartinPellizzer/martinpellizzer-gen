    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. putata, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slow growth rate, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. The leaves are small, oval, and glossy, with a leathery texture that contributes to its hardiness. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to maintain a neat shape with minimal pruning. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, preferring a cool, humid environment."
