    "intro": "Bulbophyllum jumelleanum, commonly known as the Jumellean's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green hue and red-brown markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. This species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and adaptability."
