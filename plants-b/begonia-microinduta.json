    "intro": "Begonia microinduta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elongated leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
