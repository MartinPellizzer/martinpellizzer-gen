    "intro": "Boscia plantefolii, commonly known as the African whitewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it well adapted to semi-desert conditions. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought make it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
