    "intro": "Beloperone eustachiana, commonly known as the Eustachian beloperone, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slight pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
