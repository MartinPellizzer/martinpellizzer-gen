    "intro": "Baccharoides frutescens, commonly known as the red-flowered balsa, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
