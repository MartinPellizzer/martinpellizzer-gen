    "intro": "Blaeria breviflora var. uluguruensis, commonly known as the Uluguru bladdernut, is a shrub native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by spherical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
