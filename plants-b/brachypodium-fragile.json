    "intro": "Brachypodium fragile, commonly known as false brome, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial plant with slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in a variety of habitats. Brachypodium fragile is often used in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
