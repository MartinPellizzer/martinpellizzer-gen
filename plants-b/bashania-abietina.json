    "intro": "Bashania abietina, commonly known as the white pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines, in temperate and boreal forests. The thallus is leathery and pale green, with a distinctive white or pale yellow coloration on the upper surface. It lacks a distinct upper cortex and has a simple, leaf-like structure. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
