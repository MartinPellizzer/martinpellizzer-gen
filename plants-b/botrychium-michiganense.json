    "intro": "Botrychium michiganense, commonly known as the Michigan moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, upright sterile frond and a separate, elongated fertile frond that bears spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a distinctive appearance with a rosette-like arrangement of leaves and is often found in the northeastern United States. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
