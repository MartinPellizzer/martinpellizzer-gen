    "intro": "Biscutella didyma subsp. apula, commonly known as the Apulian biscuit plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of southern Italy."
