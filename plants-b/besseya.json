It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in prairie and open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Besseya species are often found in the central and eastern United States, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with small, lance-shaped leaves."
