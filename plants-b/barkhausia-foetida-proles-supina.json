    "intro": "Barkhausia foetida proles supina, commonly known as the stinking rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its unique scent and fruit make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
