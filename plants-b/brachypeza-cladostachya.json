    "intro": "Brachypeza cladostachya, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and hairy stems, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Brachypeza cladostachya is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
