    "intro": "Blechnum magellanicum var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the Magellanic holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnatifid fronds, which are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its fronds are leathery and have a rough texture, with a deep green color that remains throughout the growing season. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
