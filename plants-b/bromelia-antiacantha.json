    "intro": "Bromelia antiacantha, commonly known as the spiny bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant features sharp, spiny margins on its leaves, which provide a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Bromelia antiacantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
