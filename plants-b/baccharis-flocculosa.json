    "intro": "Baccharis flocculosa, commonly known as white sagebrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Baccharis flocculosa plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
