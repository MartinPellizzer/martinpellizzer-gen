    "intro": "Borassus caudatus, commonly known as the areca palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Southeast Asia. It features a single, unbranched trunk covered in fibrous, leafless stems. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The fruit is a spiky, fibrous structure that contains a single seed, and the plant is valued for its fibers used in making ropes and mats."
