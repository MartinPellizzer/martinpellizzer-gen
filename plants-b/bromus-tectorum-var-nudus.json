It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and dry slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
