    "intro": "Bulbophyllum atratum, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Bulbophyllum atratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
