    "intro": "Begonia williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features vibrant, velvety foliage with intricate patterns of deep green and silver, often resembling a mosaic. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive appearance, it is popular as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
