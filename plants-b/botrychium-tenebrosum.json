    "intro": "Botrychium tenebrosum, commonly known as the dark moon fern, is a member of the Botrychiaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, upright rhizome with a cluster of fiddlehead-like fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern on the underside of the fronds. This species is often found in forest understories and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds."
