    "intro": "Bromus diandrus subsp. rigidus, commonly known as rigid brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often tinged with purple or red. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
