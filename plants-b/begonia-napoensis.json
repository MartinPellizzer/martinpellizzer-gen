    "intro": "Begonia napoensis, commonly known as the Napo begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, emerging from the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
