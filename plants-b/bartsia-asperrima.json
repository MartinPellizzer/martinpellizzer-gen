    "intro": "Bartsia asperrima, commonly known as the rough bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It grows in rocky or open habitats and is often found in high-altitude environments. Bartsia asperrima is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis."
