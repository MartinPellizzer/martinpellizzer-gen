    "intro": "Berberis parisepala, commonly known as the white-flowered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the stems retain their color throughout the colder months."
