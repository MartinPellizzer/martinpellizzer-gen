    "intro": "Bernardina stenia, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vivid crimson petals and a distinctive lip that resembles a bird's beak, aiding in pollination by specific insects. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clumps with dark green, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardina stenia is considered a conservation concern."
