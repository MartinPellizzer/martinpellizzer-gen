    "intro": "Brodiaea ixioides var. scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, scabrous leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and native plant collections."
