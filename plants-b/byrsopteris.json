    "intro": "Byrsopteris, commonly known as the fern spike moss, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Byrsopteris species often have a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow them to spread along the forest floor. They are known for their ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, each with unique frond structures and growth patterns."
