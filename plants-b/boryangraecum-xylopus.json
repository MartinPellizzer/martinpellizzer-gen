    "intro": "Boryangraecum xylopus, commonly known as the Cape fynbos lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its habitat specificity, Boryangraecum xylopus is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
