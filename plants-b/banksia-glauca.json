    "intro": "Banksia glauca, commonly known as the grey banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Banksia glauca is adapted to fire-prone environments and often regenerates after bushfires. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
