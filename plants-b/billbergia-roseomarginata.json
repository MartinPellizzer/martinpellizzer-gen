    "intro": "Billbergia roseomarginata, commonly known as the pink-edged billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often bright green with pink or red margins. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia roseomarginata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
