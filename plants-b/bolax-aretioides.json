    "intro": "Bolax aretioides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Bolax aretioides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
