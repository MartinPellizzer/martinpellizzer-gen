It is a small epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.
