It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its thick, succulent stems and fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange to red berries. Breynia rubra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils.
