    "intro": "Bletia marginata, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking pink to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Bletia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
