It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is native to the western United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
