    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tianguii, commonly known as the Tiangui's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or white with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and adaptability to cultivation."
