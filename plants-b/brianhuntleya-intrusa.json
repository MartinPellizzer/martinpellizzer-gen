    "intro": "Brianhuntleya intrusa, commonly known as the invasive swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a significant ecological concern in invaded areas. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is often classified as an invasive species due to its competitive nature and impact on native flora."
