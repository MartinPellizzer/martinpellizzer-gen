    "intro": "Betula fruticans, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that give it a graceful, cascading appearance. The leaves are small, triangular, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. The bark is smooth and white, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
