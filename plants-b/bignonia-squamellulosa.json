    "intro": "Bignonia squamellulosa, commonly known as the scarlet bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its compound leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces orange to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover, though it can become invasive if not controlled. The plant prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden conditions."
