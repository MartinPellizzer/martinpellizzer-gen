    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. hyalinus, commonly known as the silvergrass or hyaline brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that often exhibit a silvery sheen on the upper surface. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are typically pale green to silver in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf auricles and the presence of a hyaline (translucent) lemma on the spikelets."
