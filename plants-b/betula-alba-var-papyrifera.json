    "intro": "Betula alba var. papyrifera, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, which peels off in thin, papery layers. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has slender, weeping branches. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. The paper birch is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is an important species in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
