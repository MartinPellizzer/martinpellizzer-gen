    "intro": "Bulbophyllum schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Bulbophyllum schlechteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and resilience."
