    "intro": "Bougainvillea herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers inside the bracts, which are actually the true flowers. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Bougainvillea herzogiana is a woody vine that can be trained to grow on trellises or as a hedge, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
