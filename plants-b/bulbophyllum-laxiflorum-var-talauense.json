    "intro": "Bulbophyllum laxiflorum var. talauense, commonly known as the Talauan Bulbophyllum, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It features small, clustered pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
