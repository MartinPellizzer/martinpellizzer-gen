    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. germanorum, commonly known as the Savoy cabbage, is a leafy vegetable characterized by its crinkled, dark green leaves. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other members of the Brassica genus. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with a compact rosette of leaves. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps protect it from cold temperatures, making it suitable for cooler climates. This variety is valued for its culinary use and is often grown in temperate regions for its mild, earthy flavor."
