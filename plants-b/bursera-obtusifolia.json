    "intro": "Bursera obtusifolia, commonly known as the Mexican frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, orange-red fruits containing three to four seeds. Bursera obtusifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
