    "intro": "Bituminaria basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic bituminous plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark, almost black foliage that resembles bitumen, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle contrast to its dark leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bituminaria basaltica is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research."
