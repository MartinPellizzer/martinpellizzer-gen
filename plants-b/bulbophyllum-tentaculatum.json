    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tentaculatum, commonly known as the tentacle orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, curled lip that resembles a tentacle. Bulbophyllum tentaculatum requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for tropical greenhouse cultivation."
