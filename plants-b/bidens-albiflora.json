    "intro": "Bidens albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower beggar-ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape and often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers with yellow centers, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its fruits are schizocarps, meaning they split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Bidens albiflora is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
