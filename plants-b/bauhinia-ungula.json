    "intro": "Bauhinia ungula, commonly known as the red bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn red in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Bauhinia ungula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
