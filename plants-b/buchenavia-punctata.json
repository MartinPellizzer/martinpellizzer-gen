    "intro": "Buchenavia punctata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive white or yellowish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, orange or red fruits. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common invasive species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its ecological impact."
