It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. These seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Bombax species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."
