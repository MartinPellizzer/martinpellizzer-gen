It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and are visited by various pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity."
