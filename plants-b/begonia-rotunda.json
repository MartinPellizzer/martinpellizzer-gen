    "intro": "Begonia rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaved begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive round, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
