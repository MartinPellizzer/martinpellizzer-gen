    "intro": "Bidens menziesii, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features yellow flowers with ray florets and a distinctive, spiny seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and it has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Bidens menziesii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its resilience to drought."
