    "intro": "Bouteloua megapotamica, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native North American grass species characterized by its low-growing, drought-tolerant habit. It features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are visually striking. This plant is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for xeriscaping. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense, hardy turf-like stands."
