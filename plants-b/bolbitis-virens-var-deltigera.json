    "intro": "Bolbitis virens var. deltigera, commonly known as the Delta fern, is a variant of the green sword fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
