    "intro": "Baccharoides calvoana var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf baccharoides, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal landscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens along the Atlantic coast."
