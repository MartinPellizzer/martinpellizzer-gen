    "intro": "Bonjeanea venusta, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a central white or pale yellow star-shaped structure, which gives it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bonjeanea venusta is considered a conservation concern."
