    "intro": "Brassica rupestris var. gongylodes, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to xeriscaped gardens."
