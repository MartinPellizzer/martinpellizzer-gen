    "intro": "Banisteria suberosa var. candolleana, commonly known as the Candolleana banisteria, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often followed by decorative, inflated seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is sometimes grown in botanical gardens."
