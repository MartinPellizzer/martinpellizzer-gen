It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
