    "intro": "Baccharoides longepedunculata var. retusa, commonly known as the narrow-peduncled baccharoides, is a shrub native to specific regions of China. It features slender, often zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
