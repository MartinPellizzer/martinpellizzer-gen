    "intro": "Balanophora gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of trees in tropical rainforests. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow and white coloration, often resembling those of other orchids. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, Balanophora gigantea is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
