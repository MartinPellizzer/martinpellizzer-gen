    "intro": "Bulbophyllum griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal climates. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
