    "intro": "Briza triloba var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces delicate, pale green to silver-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in narrow panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
