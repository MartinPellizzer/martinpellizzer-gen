    "intro": "Brachiaria regularis, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as pastures and disturbed areas. Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
