    "intro": "Buddleja longifolia, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered panicles of pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja longifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
