    "intro": "Bromidium rigescens, commonly known as the rigid bromus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its upright, rigid growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Bromidium rigescens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
