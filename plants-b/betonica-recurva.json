    "intro": "Betonica recurva, commonly known as the zigzag betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Betonica recurva is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and stream sides. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
