It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by water. Bacopa lilagina is often used in ornamental wetland gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
