    "intro": "Brachysema macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited brachysema, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers moist, well-drained soils."
