    "intro": "Brunia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf lily-turf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale pink, during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
