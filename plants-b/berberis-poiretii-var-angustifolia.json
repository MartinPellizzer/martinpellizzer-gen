It features upright, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental addition to gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design."
