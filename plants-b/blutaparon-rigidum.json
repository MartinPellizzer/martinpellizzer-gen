    "intro": "Blutaparon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and marshes. It has small, green, ovate leaves that are usually submerged, while the bladders are often found at the water's surface. Blutaparon rigidum is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting prey."
