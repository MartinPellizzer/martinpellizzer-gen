    "intro": "Bajan, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, bright red berries that are edible for humans and animals. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
