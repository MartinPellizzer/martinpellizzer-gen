    "intro": "Bromus scoparius f. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, cylindrical inflorescence. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This form is a variant of the broader Bromus scoparius species, showing slight morphological differences in its floral structure."
