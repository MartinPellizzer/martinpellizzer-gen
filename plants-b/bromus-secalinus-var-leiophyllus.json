It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures typical of the grass family. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
