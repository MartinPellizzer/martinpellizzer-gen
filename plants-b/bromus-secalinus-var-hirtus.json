    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. hirtus, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
