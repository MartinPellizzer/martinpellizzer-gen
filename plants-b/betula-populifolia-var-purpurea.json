    "intro": "Betula populifolia var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow or green. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in disturbed or wetland habitats. The leaves often display a distinctive purplish hue during the growing season, giving the tree its common name."
