    "intro": "Bartsia tenuis, commonly known as the slender bartsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in whorls. Bartsia tenuis is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
