    "intro": "Baccharis arctostaphyloides, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in native habitats. Baccharis arctostaphyloides is often found in chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems."
