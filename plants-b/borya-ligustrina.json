It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and fast growth rate. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
