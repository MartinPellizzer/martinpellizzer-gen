It features prickly stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, decorative plants."
