It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in coastal environments, often growing in brackish water or saltwater areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dense, evergreen foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. Banisteria ochnifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
