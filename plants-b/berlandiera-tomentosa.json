    "intro": "Berlandiera tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, gray-green foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, preferring full sun. Its common name reflects the dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves."
