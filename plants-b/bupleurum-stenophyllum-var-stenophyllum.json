    "intro": "Bupleurum stenophyllum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and has finely divided, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
