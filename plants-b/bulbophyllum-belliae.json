    "intro": "Bulbophyllum belliae, commonly known as the Bell's Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal or arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the pseudobulbs. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
