    "intro": "Burmeistera caudatifolia, commonly known as the long-tailed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a violet or purple throat. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long, slender flower stems that add vertical interest to the garden."
