It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Cape Province. The plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid climates.
