It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often narrowly elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.

It is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
