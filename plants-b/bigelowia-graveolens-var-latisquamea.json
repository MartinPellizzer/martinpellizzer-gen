    "intro": "Bigelowia graveolens var. latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scale bigelowia, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. Its flowering stems are often covered in broad, overlapping scales, giving it its varietal name \"latisquamea.\" This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
