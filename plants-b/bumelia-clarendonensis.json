    "intro": "Bumelia clarendonensis, commonly known as Clarendon bumelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
