    "intro": "Brachypodium ramosum subvar. genuinum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
