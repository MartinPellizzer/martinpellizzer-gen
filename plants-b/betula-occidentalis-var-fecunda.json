    "intro": "Betula occidentalis var. fecunda, commonly known as the western birch or the Pacific silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are elongated and alternate, turning yellow in the fall, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
