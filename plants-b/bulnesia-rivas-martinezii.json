    "intro": "Bulnesia rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Guayacan tree, is a deciduous tree native to the dry forests of southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, though it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss."
