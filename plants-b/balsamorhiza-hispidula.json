    "intro": "Balsamorhiza hispidula, commonly known as the hairy bitterroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Balsamorhiza hispidula is also known for its edible roots, which were traditionally used by Native American tribes."
