    "intro": "Bulbophyllum guamense, commonly known as the Guam orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the island of Guam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
