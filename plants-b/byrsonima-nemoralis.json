    "intro": "Byrsonima nemoralis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy berries containing a single seed. Its fruits are edible, though the seeds are toxic, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
