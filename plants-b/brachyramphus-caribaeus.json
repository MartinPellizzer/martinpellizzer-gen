    "intro": "Brachyramphus caribaeus, commonly known as the Caribbean storm-petrel, is a small seabird with distinctive botanical features related to its coastal and marine habitat. Its plumage consists of dense, short feathers that provide insulation and streamline its body for efficient flight over open water. The bird's beak is short and hooked, adapted for catching small prey such as fish and plankton from the ocean surface. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often nesting on remote islands with minimal vegetation. The species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding and nesting behaviors."
