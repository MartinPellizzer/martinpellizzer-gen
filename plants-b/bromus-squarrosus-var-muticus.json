    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. muticus, commonly known as the muticous brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its reduced or absent lemma hairs, giving it a smooth appearance compared to other bromes."
