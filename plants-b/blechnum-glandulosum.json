    "intro": "Blechnum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and leathery fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of leaves. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
