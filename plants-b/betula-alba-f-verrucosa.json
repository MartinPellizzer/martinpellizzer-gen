    "intro": "Betula alba f. verrucosa, commonly known as the warty birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive, rough, and warty bark. This unique texture is caused by the presence of raised, corky projections on the trunk, which provide structural support and protection against environmental stress. The plant is a deciduous tree with slender, white-barked trunks and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The warty birch is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a variety of wildlife species."
