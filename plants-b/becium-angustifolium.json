    "intro": "Becium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved becium, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to soil stabilization in its native habitat. Becium angustifolium is often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil."
