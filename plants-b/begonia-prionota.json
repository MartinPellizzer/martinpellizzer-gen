    "intro": "Begonia prionota, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or white underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor gardens."
