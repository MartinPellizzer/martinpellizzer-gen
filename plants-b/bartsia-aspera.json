    "intro": "Bartsia aspera, commonly known as rough bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Bartsia aspera is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants."
