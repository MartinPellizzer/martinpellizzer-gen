    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. prolifera, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall inflorescence with vibrant flowers, often in red or orange hues, which attract pollinators. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
