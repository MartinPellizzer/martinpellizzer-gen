    "intro": "Blechnum puniceum, commonly known as the fire fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in its habitat. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance."
