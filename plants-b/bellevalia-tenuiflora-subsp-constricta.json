    "intro": "Bellevalia tenuiflora subsp. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The subspecies constricta is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of B. tenuiflora."
