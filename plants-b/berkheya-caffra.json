It features a rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Berkheya caffra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
