    "intro": "Bartlettina prionophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bartlettia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
