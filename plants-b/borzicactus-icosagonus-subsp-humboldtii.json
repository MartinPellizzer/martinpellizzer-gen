    "intro": "Borzicactus icosagonus subsp. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's icosagon cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, and ribbed stem that forms a star-like shape, with 20 prominent ribs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
