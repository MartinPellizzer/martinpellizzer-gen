It features small, gray-green leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in arid environments."
