    "intro": "Bertya oleifolia, commonly known as the golden bertya, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bertya oleifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
