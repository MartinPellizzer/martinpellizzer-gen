    "intro": "Bignonia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved crossvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive, tubular shape that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Bignonia microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
