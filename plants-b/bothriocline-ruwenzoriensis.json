    "intro": "Bothriocline ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly the Rwenzori Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, and it produces small, hairy leaves adapted to its harsh mountain environment. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
