    "intro": "Beloperone californica var. conferta, commonly known as the dense beloperone, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is adapted to rocky soils and coastal climates, making it a resilient member of the Apiaceae family."
