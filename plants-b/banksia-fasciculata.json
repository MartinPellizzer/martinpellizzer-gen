    "intro": "Banksia fasciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia fasciculata is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its lignified stems after bushfires. It plays an important ecological role in providing nectar for native wildlife."
