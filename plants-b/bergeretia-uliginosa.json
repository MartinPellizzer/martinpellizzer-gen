    "intro": "Bergeretia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapting to moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it in boggy environments. Bergeretia uliginosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
