    "intro": "Bryonia ruderalis, commonly known as the field bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and wastelands. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals and has a distinctive, branched stem covered in short, stiff hairs. Its fruit is a spherical, green capsule that turns orange when mature, containing several seeds. Bryonia ruderalis is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
