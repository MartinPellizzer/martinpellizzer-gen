    "intro": "Borreria ocymoides var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf borreria, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
