    "intro": "Brasiliorchis grobyoides, commonly known as the Groby's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments within the canopy of tropical rainforests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming briefly during the wet season. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native range."
