    "intro": "Brickellia megalodonta, commonly known as the large-flowered brickellia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features showy, yellow to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Brickellia megalodonta is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, thriving in full sun."
