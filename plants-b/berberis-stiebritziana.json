    "intro": "Berberis stiebritziana, commonly known as the Stiebritz barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
