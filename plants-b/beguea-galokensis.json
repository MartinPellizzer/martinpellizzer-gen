    "intro": "Beguea galokensis, commonly known as the Galokense Beguea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to habitat loss, Beguea galokensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
