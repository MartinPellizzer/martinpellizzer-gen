    "intro": "Bathmium trifoliatum var. heracleifolium, commonly known as the Heracleifolium variant of the three-leaved bathmium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring to early summer months. Its stems are often hairy and grow in a prostrate or ascending manner, adapting to its arid or semi-arid habitat. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
