    "intro": "Bombax septenatum, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often palmately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The bark is smooth and light-colored, becoming fissured with age."
