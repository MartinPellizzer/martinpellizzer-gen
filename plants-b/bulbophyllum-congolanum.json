    "intro": "Bulbophyllum congolanum, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near forest floors. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Bulbophyllum congolanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
