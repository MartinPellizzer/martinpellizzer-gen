It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies, particularly in humid forest ecosystems."
