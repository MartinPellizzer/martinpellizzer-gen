    "intro": "Balanophora ungeriana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. Its flowers are small, white, and highly fragrant, often blooming in clusters. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
