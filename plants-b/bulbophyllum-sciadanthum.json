    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sciadanthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It possesses a unique structure where its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract specific pollinators. Its growth is slow and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
