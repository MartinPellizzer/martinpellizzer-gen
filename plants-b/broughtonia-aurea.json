It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its ornamental appearance. The plant features a slender trunk covered in a fibrous sheath and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble bells. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a lush, tropical look. Broughtonia aurea is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in warm, humid conditions."
