    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon subvar. asperum, commonly known as rough bristle bentgrass, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of rough, bristly hairs on its leaves and stems. This subvariety is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, two-flowered spikelets are typical of the Brachypodium genus. The plant is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic simplicity and potential use in biofuel research."
