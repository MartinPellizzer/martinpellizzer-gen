    "intro": "Bahia leucophylla, commonly known as silverleaf bahia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its low-growing habit and fine texture make it suitable for ground cover in warm climates."
