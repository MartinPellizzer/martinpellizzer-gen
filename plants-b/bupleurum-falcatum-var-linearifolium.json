    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its linear leaves, which are narrower than those of the typical Bupleurum falcatum."
