    "intro": "Brachiaria ramosa var. pubescens, commonly known as pubescent brachiaria, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rhizomatous and stolonic growth allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. It is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
