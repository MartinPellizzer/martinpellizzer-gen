    "intro": "Batrachium lenormandii subsp. lutarium, commonly known as the Lutary Batrachium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often in rocky or sandy substrates, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are typically small and inconspicuous, are borne on short inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
