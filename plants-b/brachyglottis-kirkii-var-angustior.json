    "intro": "Brachyglottis kirkii var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brachyglottis, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
