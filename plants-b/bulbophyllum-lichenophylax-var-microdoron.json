It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded forest habitat. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a rosette, providing structural support for the delicate inflorescence. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
