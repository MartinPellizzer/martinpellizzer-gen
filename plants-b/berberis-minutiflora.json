It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. The plant has thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal color changes."
