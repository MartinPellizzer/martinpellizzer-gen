    "intro": "Bulbophyllum semiindutum, commonly known as the velvet-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
