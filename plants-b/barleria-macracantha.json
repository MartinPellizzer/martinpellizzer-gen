It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Barleria macracantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
