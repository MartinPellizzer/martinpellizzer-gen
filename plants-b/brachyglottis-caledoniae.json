    "intro": "Brachyglottis caledoniae, commonly known as the Stewart Island flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a perennial herb that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
