    "intro": "Bartlettina breedlovei, commonly known as the Texas moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and Mexico. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark and produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
