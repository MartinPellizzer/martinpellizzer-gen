    "intro": "Begonia cultrata, commonly known as the cut-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often have a distinctive cut or notch at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Begonia cultrata is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage."
