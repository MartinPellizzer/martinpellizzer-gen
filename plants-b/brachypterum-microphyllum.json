    "intro": "Brachypterum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved dwarf senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Brachypterum microphyllum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
