    "intro": "Brassavola acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with leaves directly emerging from the base of the plant. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive pattern of markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
