    "intro": "Bulbophyllum atrolabium, commonly known as the black-labored orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, dark purple to black flowers. The plant typically produces a single, showy inflorescence with several blooms, each featuring a distinctive labellum that is often darker than the rest of the flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
