    "intro": "Bollea \u00d7 pallens, commonly known as the hybrid holly, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and bright red berries. It is a natural hybrid between Ilex \u00d7 attenuata and Ilex perado, resulting in a plant with unique ornamental features. The leaves are typically elliptical with spiny margins, and the plant produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. The berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, add a striking visual element to the plant's appearance."
