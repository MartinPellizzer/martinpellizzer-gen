    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping threadleaf bupleurum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
