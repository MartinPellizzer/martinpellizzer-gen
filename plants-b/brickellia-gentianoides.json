    "intro": "Brickellia gentianoides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of silvery-gray leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Brickellia gentianoides is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
