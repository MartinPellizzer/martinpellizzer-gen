    "intro": "Bensoniella oregona, commonly known as the Oregon bensoniella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within shaded forest environments. It has a low-growing habit with woody stems and produces tiny, bell-shaped blooms in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
