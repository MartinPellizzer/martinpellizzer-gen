    "intro": "Biarum eximium, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-like flowers that resemble a slipper, which is a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Biarum eximium is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
