    "intro": "Banisteriopsis polygama, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
