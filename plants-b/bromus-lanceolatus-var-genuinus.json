It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is usually short and compact. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
