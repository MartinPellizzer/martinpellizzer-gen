It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling pomegranates. Its leaves are small and succulent, helping to conserve water in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
