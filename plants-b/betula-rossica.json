    "intro": "Betula rossica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The plant has small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, winged seeds in catkins. Betula rossica is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating extreme cold and poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in boreal and tundra ecosystems."
