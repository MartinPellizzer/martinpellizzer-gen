    "intro": "Ballota hirsuta subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the hairy ballota, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The subspecies intermedia is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Ballota hirsuta."
