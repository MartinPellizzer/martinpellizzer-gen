    "intro": "Betula saviczii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula saviczii is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in taiga and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
