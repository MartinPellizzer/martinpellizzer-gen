    "intro": "Begonia natunaensis subsp. sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its attractive, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
