    "intro": "Banksia leptostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and cylindrical, yellow to orange flowers that appear in late summer to autumn. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after the cones dry and open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to fire-prone environments. Banksia leptostachya is an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for birds and insects."
