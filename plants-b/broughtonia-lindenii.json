    "intro": "Broughtonia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindberg's brome, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Broughtonia lindenii is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native environment."
