    "intro": "Brehmia arborescens, commonly known as the tree moss, is a unique epiphytic plant that grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-drained substrates. Brehmia arborescens is often found in rainforests and is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions."
