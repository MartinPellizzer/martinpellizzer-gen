    "intro": "Byttneria scorpiura, commonly known as the scarlet starfruit, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, five-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange to red, star-shaped fruits that resemble small tomatoes. Its fruit is edible, though its seeds are toxic, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
