    "intro": "Balanophora decurrens, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a root-parasitic species that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow and are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Balanophora decurrens is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in association with other plants in shaded forest environments."
