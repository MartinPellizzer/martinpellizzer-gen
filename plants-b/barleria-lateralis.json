    "intro": "Barleria lateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barleria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for dry gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive with minimal water and maintenance."
