    "intro": "Begonia hymenophylla, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
