    "intro": "Bauhinia grandiflora, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like, bipinnate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces flat, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its adaptability and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes and coastal areas."
