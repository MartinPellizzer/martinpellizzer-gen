    "intro": "Botrychium anthemoides, commonly known as the yellow moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium anthemoides is often found growing in clusters, with its unique appearance resembling a cluster of tiny, rounded leaves."
