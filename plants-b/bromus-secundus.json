    "intro": "Bromus secundus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Bromus secundus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
