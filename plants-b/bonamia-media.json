It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible when ripe, though they are not commonly cultivated for food. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive leaves and unique fruit structure."
