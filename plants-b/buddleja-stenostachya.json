    "intro": "Buddleja stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is sometimes considered a potential weed in certain regions."
