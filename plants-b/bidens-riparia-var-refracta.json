    "intro": "Bidens riparia var. refracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly serrated edge, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along riverbanks and other wetland areas."
