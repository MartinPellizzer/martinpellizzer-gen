    "intro": "Berberis pomensis, commonly known as the Armenian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
