It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like flower clusters in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important component of arid ecosystems. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
