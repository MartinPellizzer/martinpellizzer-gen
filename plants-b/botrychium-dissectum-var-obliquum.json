    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum var. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, dissected fronds that resemble the shape of a moon, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in a single umbel, and the spores are released during the late summer months. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological niche within its habitat."
