    "intro": "Blephariglottis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, silver-green foliage and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They typically grow in coastal or moist forest environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy coating that gives them their characteristic sheen. Blephariglottis species are also valued for their ability to tolerate light shade and their relatively low maintenance requirements."
