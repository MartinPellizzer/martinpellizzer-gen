    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ignevenosum, commonly known as the yellow-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow-green inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern that varies between the dorsal and ventral sides. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
