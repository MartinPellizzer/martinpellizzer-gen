    "intro": "Berberis amurensis f. brevifolia, commonly known as the Amur barberry, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly noted for its shorter stature and dense growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces."
