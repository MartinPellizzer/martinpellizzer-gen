    "intro": "Bulbinella gibbsii, commonly known as the Gibbs' rock lily, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Bulbinella gibbsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
