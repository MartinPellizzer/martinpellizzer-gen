    "intro": "Bernhardia tannensis, commonly known as the tannic bernhardia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and has elliptical, dark green leaves. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a star-shaped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
