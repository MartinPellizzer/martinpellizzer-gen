    "intro": "Buchnera tomentosa f. pallida, commonly known as the pale woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
