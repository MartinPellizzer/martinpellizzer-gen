It typically grows in moist, riparian habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. This subspecies is adapted to wet environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
