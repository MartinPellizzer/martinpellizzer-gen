    "intro": "Blechnum helveolum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum helveolum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
