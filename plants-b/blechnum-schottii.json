    "intro": "Blechnum schottii, commonly known as the Schott's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
