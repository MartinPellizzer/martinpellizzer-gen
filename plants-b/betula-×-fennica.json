    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 fennica, commonly known as the paper birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between white birch (Betula pendula) and silver birch (Betula pendula var. capillaris). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and orange beneath. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across temperate regions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula \u00d7 fennica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Europe and parts of Asia."
