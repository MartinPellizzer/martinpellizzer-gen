    "intro": "Benstonea rostellata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of the forest canopy. Benstonea rostellata is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
