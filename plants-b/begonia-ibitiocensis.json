    "intro": "Begonia ibitiocensis, commonly known as the Ibitiocense begonia, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage and delicate, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, depending on its habitat. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Begonia ibitiocensis is considered a conservation concern."
