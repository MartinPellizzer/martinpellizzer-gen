    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria subsp. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble a moon's surface, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from specialized structures called soruses located on the underside of its fronds. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
