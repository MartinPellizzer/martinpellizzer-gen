    "intro": "Bromus syriacus, commonly known as the Syrian grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are usually 2 to 4 cm long, with two to three bracts at the base. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it typically blooms from spring to early summer. Bromus syriacus is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
