    "intro": "Berberis \u00d7 vilmorinii, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is a hybrid between Berberis julisonii and Berberis thunbergii, characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage in autumn. The plant features thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are glossy and dark green throughout the growing season. Its flowers are inconspicuous, but the berries that follow are red and edible, though not widely consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
