    "intro": "Byttneria urticifolia var. transiens, commonly known as the African balsam, is a perennial shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
