It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, often growing near the shoreline or in mangrove areas. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important species in coastal vegetation. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
