It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically bright green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Baccharis erectifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
