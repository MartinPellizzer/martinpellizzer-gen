    "intro": "Blepharis huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n's beard-tongue, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
