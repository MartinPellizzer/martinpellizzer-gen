    "intro": "Banksia benthamiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces distinctive woody follicles that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and it is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Banksia benthamiana is an important species in the ecological communities of the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot."
