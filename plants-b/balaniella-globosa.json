    "intro": "Balaniella globosa, commonly known as the globular broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its rounded, fleshy stem and small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or greenish in color. Balaniella globosa is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it thrives in association with specific host plants."
