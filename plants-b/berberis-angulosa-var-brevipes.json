    "intro": "Berberis angulosa var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features woody stems with sharp, angular thorns and small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
