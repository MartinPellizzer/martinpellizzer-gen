    "intro": "Betula nana var. europaea, commonly known as the European dwarf birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter, and its smooth, gray bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in the fall. This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
