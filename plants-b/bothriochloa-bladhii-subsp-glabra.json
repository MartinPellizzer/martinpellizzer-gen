    "intro": "Bothriochloa bladhii subsp. glabra, commonly known as smooth bladh's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very softly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
