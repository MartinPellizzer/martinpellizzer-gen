    "intro": "Bidens connata var. fallax, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent white markings, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Bidens connata var. fallax is often found in sandy soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun."
