    "intro": "Besleria petiolaris, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are fleshy and thick, adapted to store water in its arid environment. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
