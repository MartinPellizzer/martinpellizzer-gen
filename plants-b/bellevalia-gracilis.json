    "intro": "Bellevalia gracilis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Bellevalia gracilis is also noted for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
