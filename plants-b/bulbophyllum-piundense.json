    "intro": "Bulbophyllum piundense, commonly known as the Piundense orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, with a unique shape that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum piundense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural growing conditions."
