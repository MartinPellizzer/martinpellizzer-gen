    "intro": "Brainea insignis var. formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan brainea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Taiwan and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are often hidden within a fleshy, spiny structure called a cyathium. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
