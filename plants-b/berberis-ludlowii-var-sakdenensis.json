    "intro": "Berberis ludlowii var. sakdenensis, commonly known as the Sakden's barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
