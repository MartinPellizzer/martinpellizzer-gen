It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability, it is widely used in plant biology research."
