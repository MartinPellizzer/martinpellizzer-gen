It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a distinctive bluish-green color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
