    "intro": "Bufonia duvaljouvei var. aurasiaca, commonly known as the aurasiatic bufonia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited study, very little is known about its ecological role and conservation status."
