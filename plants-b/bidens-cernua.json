    "intro": "Bidens cernua, commonly known as the downy ironweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, downy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as wetlands and roadside areas. Bidens cernua is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
