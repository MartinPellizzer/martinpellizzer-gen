    "intro": "Bromus arvensis f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow false brome, is a variant of the annual grass species Bromus arvensis. It is characterized by its pale yellow to golden-green foliage, distinguishing it from the typical green form of the species. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America, where it is often found in disturbed soils. It typically grows in open areas such as fields, roadsides, and waste ground. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually pale yellow, contributing to its ornamental appeal in some horticultural settings."
