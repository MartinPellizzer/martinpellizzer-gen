    "intro": "Bergenia crassifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved bergenia, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with low light conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens in cooler temperate regions."
