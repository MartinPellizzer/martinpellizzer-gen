    "intro": "Bosea humilis, commonly known as the lowland fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its delicate, arrow-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Bosea humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
