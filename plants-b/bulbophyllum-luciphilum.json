    "intro": "Bulbophyllum luciphilum, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, often fluorescent flowers that emit a soft glow in the dark, a trait that aids in attracting its specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that enhance their visual appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
