    "intro": "Brachiaria semiverticillata, commonly known as flatstem brachiaria, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that are usually racemes or panicles, bearing small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but is particularly adapted to wet or marshy environments. Brachiaria semiverticillata is often used in pastureland due to its high forage value and tolerance to grazing."
