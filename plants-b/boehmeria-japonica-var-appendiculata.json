It features fibrous, rhizomatous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seeds. It is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisine and as a source of natural fiber. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental and utilitarian purposes in its native habitat."
