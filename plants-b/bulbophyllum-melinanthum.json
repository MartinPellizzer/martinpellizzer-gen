    "intro": "Bulbophyllum melinanthum, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its bulbs, which are specialized storage organs, help it survive periods of drought. Bulbophyllum melinanthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique growth habits."
