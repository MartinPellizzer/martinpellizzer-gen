    "intro": "Boerhavia annulata, commonly known as the redroot sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Boerhavia annulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties."
