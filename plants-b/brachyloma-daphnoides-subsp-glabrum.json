    "intro": "Brachyloma daphnoides subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous daphnoid bush, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine, short hairs, though the subspecies glabrum is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences and are often pink or red in color. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained soils."
