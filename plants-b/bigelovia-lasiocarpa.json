    "intro": "Bigelovia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf bigelovia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, often grayish leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic properties."
