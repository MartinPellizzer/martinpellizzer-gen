    "intro": "Bruguiera gymnorhiza, commonly known as the mangrove tree or mangrove shrub, is a halophytic species adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soil. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key component of mangrove ecosystems. Bruguiera gymnorhiza plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine biodiversity."
