    "intro": "Bertolonia duasbocaensis, commonly known as the Duasboca fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spores produced in specialized clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
