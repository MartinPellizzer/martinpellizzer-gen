    "intro": "Bidens bipinnata var. simplicior, commonly known as the lesser beggarweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, pinnately divided leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in wetland areas, along roadsides, and in fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
