    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. argillaceus, commonly known as the claygrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of dense, spikelet-bearing branches, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
