    "intro": "Boswellia bricchettii, commonly known as the Somali frankincense tree, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces a resinous sap that is tapped for its aromatic gum, used in incense and traditional medicine. The tree thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils across Somalia and Ethiopia. Its botanical features include a gnarled trunk and a dense canopy, which help it survive in harsh climatic conditions. The resin of Boswellia bricchettii is highly valued for its therapeutic properties and cultural significance."
