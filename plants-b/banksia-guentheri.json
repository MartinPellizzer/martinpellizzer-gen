    "intro": "Banksia guentheri, commonly known as the Western Australian banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern region of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain the seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Banksia guentheri thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various native wildlife species."
