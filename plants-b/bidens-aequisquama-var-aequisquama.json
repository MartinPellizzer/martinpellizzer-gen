    "intro": "Bidens aequisquama var. aequisquama, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common weed but also a valuable plant for ecological studies."
