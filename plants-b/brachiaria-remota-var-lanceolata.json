It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for pasture and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it an important forage plant in agricultural systems."
