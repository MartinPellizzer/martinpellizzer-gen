    "intro": "Becium grandiflorum var. turkanaense, commonly known as Turkana becium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Due to its resilience, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood in its native habitat."
