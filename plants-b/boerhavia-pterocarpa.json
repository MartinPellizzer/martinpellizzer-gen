    "intro": "Boerhavia pterocarpa, commonly known as the hairy boerhavia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical features include the presence of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Boerhavia pterocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
