    "intro": "Bellevalia chrisii, commonly known as the Chris's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
