    "intro": "Baccharis lateralis, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity. Its structure and appearance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat in its native range."
