    "intro": "Baccharis brachylaenoides f. tergopilosa, commonly known as the woolly baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
