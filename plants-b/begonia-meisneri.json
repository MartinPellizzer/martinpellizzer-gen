    "intro": "Begonia meisneri, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a rich, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
