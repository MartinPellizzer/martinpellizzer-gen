    "intro": "Boehmeria gigantea, commonly known as giant mulberry, is a large, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds dispersed by the wind. Boehmeria gigantea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its fibrous stalks have been used in traditional crafts and textiles due to their strength and flexibility."
