It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, purple-pink flower heads.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it both visually striking and ecologically beneficial."
