    "intro": "Bassia sedoides, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the production of dry, papery seed heads that easily detach and roll away in the wind. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, and it produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed efficiently by wind. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
