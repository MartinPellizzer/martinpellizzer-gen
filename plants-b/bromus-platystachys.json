    "intro": "Bromus platystachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Bromus platystachys is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
