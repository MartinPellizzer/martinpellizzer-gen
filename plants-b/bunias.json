    "intro": "Bunias, commonly known as leafy greens or field mustard, are members of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and broccoli. These plants are characterized by their alternate, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that form in clusters. Bunias are typically annual or biennial herbs that thrive in temperate climates and are often found in disturbed soils. They have a distinctive mustard-like odor and are sometimes cultivated for their edible leaves. The plant's root system is fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
