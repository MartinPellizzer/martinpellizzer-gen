    "intro": "Baccharis pilularis var. typica, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, narrow leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in landscaping."
