    "intro": "[WRONG START] Boronia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine borbonia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring. It has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borbonia alpestris is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
