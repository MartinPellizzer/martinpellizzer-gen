    "intro": "Bargemontia albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Bargemontia albescens plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
