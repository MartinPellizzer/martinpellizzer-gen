    "intro": "Bacopa madagascariensis, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers and its creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant thrives in moist environments, such as wetlands and stream banks, and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, while its stems are square in cross-section, a common trait among the mint family. Bacopa madagascariensis is also noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal medicine."
