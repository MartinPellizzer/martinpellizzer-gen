    "intro": "Biarum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique floral structure plays a role in attracting specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles."
