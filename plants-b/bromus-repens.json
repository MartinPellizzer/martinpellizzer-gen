    "intro": "Bromus repens, commonly known as the prostrate brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, leafless stems that lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and open fields. Bromus repens is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ability to colonize poor soils."
