    "intro": "Bursera ovata, commonly known as the Mexican lac tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used traditionally for its resin, which can be tapped like frankincense. Bursera ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
