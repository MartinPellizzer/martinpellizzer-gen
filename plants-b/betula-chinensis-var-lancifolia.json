    "intro": "Betula chinensis var. lancifolia, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
