    "intro": "Bupleurum scorzonerifolium subsp. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf goat's-beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Scorzonera. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
