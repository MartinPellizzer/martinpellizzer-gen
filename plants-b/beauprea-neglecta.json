    "intro": "Beauprea neglecta, commonly known as the Pacific beach pea, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the western Pacific. It is a low-growing shrub with small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms. Beauprea neglecta is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation by seawater."
