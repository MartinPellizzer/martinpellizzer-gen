    "intro": "Bulbophyllum indragiriense, commonly known as the Indragiri orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant produces linear, grass-like leaves and bears small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
