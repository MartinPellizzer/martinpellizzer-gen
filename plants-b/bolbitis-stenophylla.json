    "intro": "Bolbitis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats on the water's surface. Its fronds are usually divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. Bolbitis stenophylla is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
