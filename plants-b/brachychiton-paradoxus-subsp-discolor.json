    "intro": "Brachychiton paradoxus subsp. discolor, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety bark that gives it its common name, and its striking, showy flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, and it produces capsule fruits that split open to release its seeds. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
