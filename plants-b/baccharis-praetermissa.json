    "intro": "Baccharis praetermissa, commonly known as swamp baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Baccharis praetermissa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to support local wildlife."
