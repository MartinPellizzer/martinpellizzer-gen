    "intro": "Benzoin subcaudatum, commonly known as the Madagascar benzoin tree, is a member of the Burseraceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is harvested for commercial use. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, yellowish pollen that attracts various pollinators. The resin, known as benzoin, is used in perfumery and traditional medicine for its balsamic scent and therapeutic properties."
