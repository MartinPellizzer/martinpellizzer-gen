    "intro": "Bonamia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bonamia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
