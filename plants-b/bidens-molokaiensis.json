    "intro": "Bidens molokaiensis, commonly known as Molokai ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with distinctive white markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
