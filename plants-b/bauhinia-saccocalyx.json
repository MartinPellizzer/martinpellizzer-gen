    "intro": "Bauhinia saccocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Bauhinia saccocalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are encased in a saccate (sac-like) pod, giving it its scientific name."
