    "intro": "Bermudiana marchio, commonly known as the Bermuda marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It thrives in wet, sandy soils and is typically found in marshy areas along the shoreline. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers during the spring season. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in the saline and humid environment of Bermuda. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
