    "intro": "Brachycladium, commonly known as coastal grass or sea grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. Brachycladium species are characterized by their slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems. Due to their adaptability, they are often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
