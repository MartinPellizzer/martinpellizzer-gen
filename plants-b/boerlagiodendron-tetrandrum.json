    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron tetrandrum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
