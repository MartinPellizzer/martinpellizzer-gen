    "intro": "Balaneikon, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by oval, berry-like fruits. Balaneikon is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
