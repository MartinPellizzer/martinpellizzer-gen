    "intro": "Banisterodes longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved banister, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
