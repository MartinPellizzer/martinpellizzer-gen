    "intro": "Biauricula pinnatifida, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid margin, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shady environments. Biauricula pinnatifida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in water gardens and bog landscapes."
