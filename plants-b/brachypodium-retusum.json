    "intro": "Brachypodium retusum, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Brachypodium retusum is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is also valued for its use in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics research."
