    "intro": "Banksia comosa, commonly known as the woolly banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grey foliage and cylindrical yellow flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its flowers provide nectar for a variety of native birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems. The woody follicles that form after flowering contain seeds that are dispersed by animals and wind."
