It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows on rocky substrates in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features delicate, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive scent. Its leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to conserve water, reflecting its xerophytic nature. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
