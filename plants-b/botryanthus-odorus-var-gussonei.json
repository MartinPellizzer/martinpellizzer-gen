    "intro": "Botryanthus odorus var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussonei fragrant bellflower, is a rare and ornamental plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often emitting a subtle, sweet fragrance. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
