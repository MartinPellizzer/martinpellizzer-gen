    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, with lemmas that are typically hairy and pointed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
