    "intro": "Bromus cincinnatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Bromus cincinnatus is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
