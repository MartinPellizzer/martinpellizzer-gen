    "intro": "Biscutella lima proles mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean biscuit flower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to the harsh, arid environments of the Mediterranean climate."
