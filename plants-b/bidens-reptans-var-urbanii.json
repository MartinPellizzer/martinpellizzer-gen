    "intro": "Bidens reptans var. urbanii, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to establish quickly in moist, disturbed soils. This species is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides, where it thrives in humid environments."
