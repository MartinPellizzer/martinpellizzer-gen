    "intro": "Briza microstachya, commonly known as little quillwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, whorled leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, spike-like clusters that produce minute seeds, which are dispersed by water currents. Briza microstachya plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
