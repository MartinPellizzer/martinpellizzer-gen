    "intro": "Betula glandulosa var. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones."
