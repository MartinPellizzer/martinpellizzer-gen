    "intro": "Bauhinia viorna, commonly known as the velvetwood or yellow bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves composed of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the dry season. Bauhinia viorna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
