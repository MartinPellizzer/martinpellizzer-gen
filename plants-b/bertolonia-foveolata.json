It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has rough, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
