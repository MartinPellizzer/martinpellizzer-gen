    "intro": "Berberis franchetiana var. gombalana, commonly known as the Gombala barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of the Berberis genus. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
