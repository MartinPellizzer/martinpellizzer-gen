    "intro": "Breynia cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its grayish-white, papery leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles. Breynia cinerascens is adapted to arid environments and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought resistance."
