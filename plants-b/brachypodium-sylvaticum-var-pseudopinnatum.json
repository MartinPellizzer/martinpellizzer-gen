    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. pseudopinnatum, commonly known as the false feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological value and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
