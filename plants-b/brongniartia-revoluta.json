    "intro": "Brongniartia revoluta, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a striking member of the Cycadaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces strikingly ornamental, red-brown cones that are both male and female, with the female cones being particularly showy. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
