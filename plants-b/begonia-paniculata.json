    "intro": "Begonia paniculata, commonly known as the clustered begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia paniculata is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
