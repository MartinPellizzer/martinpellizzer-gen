    "intro": "Begonia venusta, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and thrives in partial shade with well-draining soil. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Begonia venusta is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its beauty and relatively low maintenance requirements."
