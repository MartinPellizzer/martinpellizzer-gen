    "intro": "Brachystephanus holstii, commonly known as the Holst's rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
