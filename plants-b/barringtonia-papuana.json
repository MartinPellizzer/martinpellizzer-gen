    "intro": "Barringtonia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan lantern tree, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-like flowers that are pale yellow with a greenish tinge and emit a sweet fragrance, especially at night. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its large, palmate leaves and smooth, grayish bark. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy pulp. Barringtonia papuana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
