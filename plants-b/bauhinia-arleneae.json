    "intro": "Bauhinia arleneae, commonly known as the Arlene's bauhinia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, papery, bipinnate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Bauhinia arleneae is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
