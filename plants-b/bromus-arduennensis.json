    "intro": "Bromus arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennes bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the Pyrenees Mountains in Europe. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny areas. Bromus arduennensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
