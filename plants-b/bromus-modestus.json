    "intro": "Bromus modestus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it blooms in late summer to early fall. Bromus modestus is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
