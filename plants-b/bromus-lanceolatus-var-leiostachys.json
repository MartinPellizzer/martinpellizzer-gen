    "intro": "Bromus lanceolatus var. leiostachys, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with leathery, awned glumes that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
