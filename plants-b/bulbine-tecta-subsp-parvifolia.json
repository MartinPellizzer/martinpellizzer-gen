    "intro": "Bulbine tecta subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
