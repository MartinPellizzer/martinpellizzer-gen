    "intro": "Bulbostylis californica, commonly known as the California bulbgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its bulbous base allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
