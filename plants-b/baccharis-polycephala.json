It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, arching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the early spring. Baccharis polycephala is often found in disturbed or swampy habitats and is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
