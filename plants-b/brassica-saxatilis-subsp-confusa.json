    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis subsp. confusa, commonly known as the Scottish kale, is a perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that are somewhat similar to cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by round, green pods containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and rocky environments, tolerating salt spray and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
