    "intro": "Banisteria membranifolia, commonly known as the white-veined stinging tree, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Due to its unique appearance and defensive properties, it is often found in rainforest understories where it climbs toward light."
