    "intro": "Baccharis usterii, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Baccharis usterii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
