    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, and it produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Butomus umbellatus."
