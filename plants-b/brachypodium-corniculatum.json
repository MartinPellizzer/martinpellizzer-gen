    "intro": "Brachypodium corniculatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-green color, which helps distinguish it from similar species. Brachypodium corniculatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
