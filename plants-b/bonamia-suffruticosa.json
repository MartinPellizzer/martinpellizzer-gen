    "intro": "Bonamia suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a woody shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and filter water. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread along coastal areas. Bonamia suffruticosa plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing soil erosion."
