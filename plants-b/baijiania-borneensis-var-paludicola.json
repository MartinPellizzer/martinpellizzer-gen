    "intro": "Baijiania borneensis var. paludicola, commonly known as the Bornean swamp orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the swampy lowland areas of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, waterlogged soils, often growing near riverbanks or in peat swamp forests. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat destruction and limited natural distribution. This orchid plays a unique role in the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems."
