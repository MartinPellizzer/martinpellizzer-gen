It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which are often yellow or greenish-yellow, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators."
