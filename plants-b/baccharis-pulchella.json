    "intro": "Baccharis pulchella, commonly known as the showy Baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Baccharis pulchella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
