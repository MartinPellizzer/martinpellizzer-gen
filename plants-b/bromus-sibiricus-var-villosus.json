    "intro": "Bromus sibiricus var. villosus, commonly known as the Siberian brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, elongated clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
