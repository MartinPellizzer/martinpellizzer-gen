    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 subtricholepidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Betula pendula and Betula platyphylla. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. The narrow-leaf birch is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
