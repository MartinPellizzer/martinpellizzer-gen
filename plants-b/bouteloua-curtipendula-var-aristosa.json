    "intro": "Bouteloua curtipendula var. aristosa, commonly known as pinkgrama or hairawn grama, is a native grass species found throughout the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a soft pink or reddish tinge to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native plant landscapes."
