    "intro": "Brassica repanda subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea kale, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is a perennial herb with thick, fleshy leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its root system is robust, allowing it to anchor in unstable coastal soils. It is often found in salt marshes and along the shores of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts."
