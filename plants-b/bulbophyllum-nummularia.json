    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nummularia, commonly known as the shield orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, with a unique, shield-like shape. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in low-light conditions. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
