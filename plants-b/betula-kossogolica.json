It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The plant has small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces catkins as its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in taiga and tundra regions. Betula kossogolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
