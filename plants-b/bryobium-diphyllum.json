It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically two-ranked, giving it its common name. The plant forms dense, carpet-like mats on moist, shaded surfaces, often found in temperate regions. Bryobium diphyllum has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of forest floor ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and nutrient cycling."
