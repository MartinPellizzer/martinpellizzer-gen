    "intro": "Begonia parva, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, featuring delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against pests. Begonia parva is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care."
