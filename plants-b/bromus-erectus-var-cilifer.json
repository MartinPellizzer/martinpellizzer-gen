    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. cilifer, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has upright, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small spikelets that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
