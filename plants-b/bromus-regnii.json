    "intro": "Bromus regnii, commonly known as the royal brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in association with other grasses in mixed communities. Bromus regnii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
