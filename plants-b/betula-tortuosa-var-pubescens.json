    "intro": "Betula tortuosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent birch, is a variant of the tortuose birch native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The bark of this plant is typically white or pale gray, with a rough, fissured texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil."
