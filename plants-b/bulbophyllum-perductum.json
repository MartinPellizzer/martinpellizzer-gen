    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perductum, commonly known as the perducent orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often pendulous flower spikes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
