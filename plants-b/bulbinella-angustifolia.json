    "intro": "Bulbinella angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbinella, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It features a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose cluster during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Bulbinella angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering display."
