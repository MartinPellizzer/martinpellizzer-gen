It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghost-like appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of ghostly figures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
