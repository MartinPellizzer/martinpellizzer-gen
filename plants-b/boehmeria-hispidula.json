    "intro": "Boehmeria hispidula, commonly known as woolly flax or Chinese flax, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for textile production, similar to flax. Boehmeria hispidula is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates."
