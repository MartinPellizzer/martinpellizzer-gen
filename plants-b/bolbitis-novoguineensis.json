    "intro": "Bolbitis novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Bolbitis novoguineensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
