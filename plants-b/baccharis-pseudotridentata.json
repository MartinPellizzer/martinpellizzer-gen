It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across arid environments.
