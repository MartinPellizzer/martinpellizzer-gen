    "intro": "Betula delavayi var. polyneura, commonly known as the Yunnan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its smooth, white to pale gray bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The plant has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
