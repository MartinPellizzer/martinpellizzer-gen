    "intro": "Betula platyphylla subsp. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine and local ecosystems."
