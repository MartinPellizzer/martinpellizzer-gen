    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered brome, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a bluish-green color, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
