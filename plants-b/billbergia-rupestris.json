    "intro": "Billbergia rupestris, commonly known as the rock billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, arching inflorescence that bears vibrant orange-red flowers, which bloom for several weeks. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that form a rosette, often adorned with white or silver markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia rupestris is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
