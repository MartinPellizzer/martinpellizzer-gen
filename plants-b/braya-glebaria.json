    "intro": "Braya glebaria, commonly known as the glabrous braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are arranged in a rosette, helping it conserve water in harsh environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that mature in the summer. Braya glebaria is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in regions with limited water availability."
