    "intro": "Bufonia capsularis, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits. Bufonia capsularis is often cultivated for its timber and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of incense. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight."
