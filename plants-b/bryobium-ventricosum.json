    "intro": "Bryobium ventricosum, commonly known as the cushion moss, is a small, slow-growing moss that forms dense, low-growing mats. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact structure with tightly packed stems and leaves that are often curved. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Bryobium ventricosum plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitat."
