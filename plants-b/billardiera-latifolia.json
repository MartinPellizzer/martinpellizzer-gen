    "intro": "Billardiera latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fleshy, red berries. It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host. Billardiera latifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting native wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
