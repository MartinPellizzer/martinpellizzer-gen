    "intro": "Byttneria osaensis, commonly known as the African soursop, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but is generally smaller and less commonly consumed. Its botanical features include rough, hairy stems and a woody structure that supports its growth in humid, tropical environments. The plant is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic applications."
