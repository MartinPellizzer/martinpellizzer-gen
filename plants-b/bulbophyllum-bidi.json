    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bidi, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and often appear in clusters, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
