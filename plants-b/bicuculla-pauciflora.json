    "intro": "Bicuculla pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
