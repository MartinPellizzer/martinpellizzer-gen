    "intro": "Begonia albococcinea, commonly known as the white-coral begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or white, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and floral display, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
