    "intro": "Betula alba lusus rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombifoliate birch, is a rare variant of the white birch. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves, which set it apart from typical birch species. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, temperate climates. It has a slender trunk and produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
