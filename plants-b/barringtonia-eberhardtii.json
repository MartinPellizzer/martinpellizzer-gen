    "intro": "Barringtonia eberhardtii, commonly known as the white cedar, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking white, pendulous flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces a large, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, often dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
