    "intro": "Bidens marginata, commonly known as the margined ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Bidens marginata is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
