    "intro": "Bistorta vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like roots. The plant features upright, slightly zigzagging stems that are covered in soft, hairy tissue. Its leaves are broad, arrow-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple hue, especially in cooler climates. Bistorta vivipara is notable for its ability to produce live young shoots from the base of its stems, a characteristic that gives it its common name."
