    "intro": "Bambusa diversistachya, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-green foliage and robust, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers. Its rapid growth rate makes it popular for ornamental use and erosion control. Bambusa diversistachya is also valued for its strong, lightweight culms, which are used in construction and crafts."
