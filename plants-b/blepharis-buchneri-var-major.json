    "intro": "Blepharis buchneri var. major, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale blue to purple in color, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other short-tongued insects. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself, contributing to its presence in disturbed or sandy habitats."
