    "intro": "Begonia persistens, commonly known as the everlasting begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that can retain moisture for extended periods, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its unique ability to retain water makes it relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
