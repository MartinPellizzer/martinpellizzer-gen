    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa var. macrantha, commonly known as the sticky weed or sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
