It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of yellow flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are red when ripe, containing a single seed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Boscia polyantha is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
