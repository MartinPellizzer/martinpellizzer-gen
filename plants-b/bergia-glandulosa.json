    "intro": "Bergia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bergia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to arid and saline environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white. Bergia glandulosa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and drought makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
