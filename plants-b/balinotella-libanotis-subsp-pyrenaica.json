    "intro": "Balinotella libanotis subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
