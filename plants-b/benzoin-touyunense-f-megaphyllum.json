    "intro": "Benzoin touyunense f. megaphyllum, commonly known as the giant benzoin, is a rare and unique plant species native to Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a fragrant resin, similar to frankincense and myrrh, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its distinctive morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protection."
