    "intro": "Bidens filamentosa, commonly known as the filaments beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens filamentosa is often found in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
