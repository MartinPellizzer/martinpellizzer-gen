    "intro": "Bellevalia ciliata, commonly known as the fringed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with fringed petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Bellevalia ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-shaped blooms."
