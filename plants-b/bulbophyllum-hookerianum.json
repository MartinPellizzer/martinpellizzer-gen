    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its elongated, often hairy leaves. The plant produces inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
