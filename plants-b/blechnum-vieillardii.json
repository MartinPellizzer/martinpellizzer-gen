It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
