    "intro": "Beckwithia camissonis, commonly known as the coastal beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Beckwithia camissonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
