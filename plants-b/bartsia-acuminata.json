    "intro": "Bartsia acuminata, commonly known as the acuteleaf bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has delicate, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in whorls, usually pink or white, and bloom in late spring. Bartsia acuminata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, thanks to its semi-parasitic nature."
