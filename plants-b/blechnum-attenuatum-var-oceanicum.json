    "intro": "Blechnum attenuatum var. oceanicum, commonly known as the oceanic harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates near the shoreline. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a unique pattern. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing coastal soils."
