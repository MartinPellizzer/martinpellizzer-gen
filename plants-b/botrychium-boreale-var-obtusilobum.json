    "intro": "Botrychium boreale var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed moonwort, is a fern species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its unique, small, and delicate fronds that resemble a cluster of small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its broad, rounded leaf lobes, which set it apart from other similar species within the Botrychium genus."
