    "intro": "Bromus riparius, commonly known as the riparian brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tussocks, and its leaves are narrow and blade-like with a slightly hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often loosely arranged in a panicle. Bromus riparius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
