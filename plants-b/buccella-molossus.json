    "intro": "Buccella molossus, commonly known as the molossus orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The orchid's flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds, making it an important part of its ecosystem."
