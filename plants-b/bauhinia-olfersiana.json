It is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often deciduous during the dry season. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels and are pollinated by insects. Bauhinia olfersiana is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
