    "intro": "Betula grayi, commonly known as Gray birch, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula grayi typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
