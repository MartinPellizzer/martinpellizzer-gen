    "intro": "Bignonia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly morning glory, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 20 feet long, making it an effective climber for trellises or arbors. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds."
