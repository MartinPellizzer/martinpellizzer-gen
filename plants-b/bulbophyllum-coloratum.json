    "intro": "Bulbophyllum coloratum, commonly known as the rainbow phalaenopsis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, colorful inflorescences that feature a mix of pink, red, and white flowers. The plant produces elongated, pendant flowers that bloom sequentially along a single stem, often displaying a gradient of colors. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Bulbophyllum coloratum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
