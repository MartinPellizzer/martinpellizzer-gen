    "intro": "Bryophyllum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring and absorbing water and nutrients. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are usually found on the surface of the plant. Bryophyllum uniflorum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
