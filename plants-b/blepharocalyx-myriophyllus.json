    "intro": "Blepharocalyx myriophyllus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are pale yellow and bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
