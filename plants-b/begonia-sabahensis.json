It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
