It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
