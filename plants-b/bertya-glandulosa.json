    "intro": "Bertya glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bertya, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salinity. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pink or red in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Bertya glandulosa is adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
