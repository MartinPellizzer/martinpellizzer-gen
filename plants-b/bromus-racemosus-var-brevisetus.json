It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted clumps of slender blades. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often loosely arranged and have short, bristly bracts. Its leaves are narrow, with a bluish-green color and a prominent midvein. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
