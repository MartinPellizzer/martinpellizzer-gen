    "intro": "Besleria inodora, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in the humid, shaded environments it prefers. Besleria inodora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
