    "intro": "Bromus capillaris, commonly known as silky brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Bromus capillaris is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
