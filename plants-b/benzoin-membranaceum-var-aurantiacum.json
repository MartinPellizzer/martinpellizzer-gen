    "intro": "Benzoin membranaceum var. aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden benzoin, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic resinous exudate, which is harvested from the bark and used in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has small, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are inconspicuous, but the plant produces distinctive, fragrant resinous capsules that contain the essential oils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
