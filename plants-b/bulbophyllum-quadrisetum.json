    "intro": "Bulbophyllum quadrisetum, commonly known as the four-ribbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, often with a waxy texture. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
