    "intro": "Begonia gigantea, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
