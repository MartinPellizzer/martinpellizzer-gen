    "intro": "Bucco pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful buccoid, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as moths and bees. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, Bucco pulchella is considered endangered and is often found in protected reserves."
