    "intro": "Bolbitis labrusca, commonly known as the red-brown fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fertile fronds that contrast with its lighter, more delicate sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Bolbitis labrusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
