    "intro": "Boehmeria pilosiuscula var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as silky flax, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silken appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for textile production due to their strong, flexible fibers."
