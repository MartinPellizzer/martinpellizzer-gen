    "intro": "Bromus giganteus, commonly known as the giant brome, is a tall annual grass species native to western North America. It typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its inflorescence is usually a single, terminal panicle, and it flowers in late summer to early fall. Bromus giganteus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
