    "intro": "Blephariglottis \u00d7 keenanii, commonly known as the Keenan\u2019s blephariglottis, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and striking, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
