    "intro": "Bogoria matutina, commonly known as the morning bog orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of East Africa. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic bog environments, often found in shallow water or damp soil. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom early in the morning, hence its common name. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged substrate, and it has specialized structures to prevent rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
