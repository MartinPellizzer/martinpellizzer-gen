    "intro": "Betula humilis var. commutata, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing form, with multiple stems emerging from the base. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This plant thrives in harsh, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments."
