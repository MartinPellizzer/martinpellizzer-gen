    "intro": "Bursera pilosa, commonly known as the rough bursera, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its rough, often thorny bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing oval seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and scrublands. Bursera pilosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally for its resin and medicinal properties."
