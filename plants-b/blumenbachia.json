    "intro": "Blumenbachia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants characterized by its night-blooming habit. These plants typically have large, showy flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. The botanical features include thick, waxy petals that reflect moonlight, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Blumenbachia species are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting nighttime pollinators."
