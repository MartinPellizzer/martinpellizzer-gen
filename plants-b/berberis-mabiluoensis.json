    "intro": "Berberis mabiluoensis, commonly known as the Mabiluo barberry, is a shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
