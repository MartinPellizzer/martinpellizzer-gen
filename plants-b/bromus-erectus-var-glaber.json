    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three flowering lemmas. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with short hairs, while the stems are sturdy and often branched. This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is used for forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
