    "intro": "Billbergia \u00d7 krameri, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Billbergia nana and Billbergia zebrina. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is typically green with white or silver markings, adding ornamental value to both indoor and outdoor gardens. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
