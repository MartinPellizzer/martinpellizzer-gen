    "intro": "Belotia campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's belotia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive with adequate humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture, while its flowers display vibrant colors ranging from pink to deep red. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Belotia campbellii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
