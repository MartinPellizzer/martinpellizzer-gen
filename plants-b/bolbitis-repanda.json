    "intro": "Bolbitis repanda, commonly known as the creeping hart's tongue fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, dark green fronds. The fronds are typically elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
