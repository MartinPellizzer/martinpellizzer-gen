    "intro": "Bromus commutatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Bromus commutatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock in certain regions."
