    "intro": "Banisteria adenopoda, commonly known as the velvetleaf bignay, is a woody climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with soft, velvety undersides, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
