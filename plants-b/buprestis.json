    "intro": "Buprestis, commonly known as the metallic wood-boring beetle, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Buprestidae. These insects are characterized by their striking metallic coloration, often displaying iridescent green, blue, or bronze hues. The larvae of Buprestis species are known as flathead borers and play a role in the natural decomposition of dead wood. They typically feed on the inner wood of trees, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Despite their ecological importance, some species can cause damage to living trees, making them both beneficial and sometimes problematic."
