    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pensile, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Bulbophyllum pensile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
