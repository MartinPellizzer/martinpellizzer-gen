    "intro": "Bragantia hispida, commonly known as the rough bracken, is a fern native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
