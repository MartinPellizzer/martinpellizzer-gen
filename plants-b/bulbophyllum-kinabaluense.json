    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often in shades of pink and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
