    "intro": "Banksia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by fire, a common occurrence in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Banksia littoralis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species."
