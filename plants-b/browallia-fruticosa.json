    "intro": "Browallia fruticosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf browallia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, upright stems covered in soft, velvety foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of violet, blue, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy surface that gives the plant its common name. Browallia fruticosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
