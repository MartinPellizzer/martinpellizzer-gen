    "intro": "Brunonia australis, commonly known as the coastal wallaby-jack, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and dunes. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Brunonia australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
