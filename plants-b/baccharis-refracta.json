    "intro": "Baccharis refracta, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Baccharis refracta is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
