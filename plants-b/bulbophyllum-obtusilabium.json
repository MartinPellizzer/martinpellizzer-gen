    "intro": "Bulbophyllum obtusilabium, commonly known as the blunt-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive, bluntly shaped lip. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in less favorable conditions. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability make it a notable species within the Orchidaceae family."
