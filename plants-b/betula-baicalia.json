    "intro": "Betula baicalia, commonly known as the Baical birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. Betula baicalia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
