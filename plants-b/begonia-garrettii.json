    "intro": "Begonia garrettii, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and vibrant red bracts that surround its small, delicate flowers. The leaves are often hairy and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
