It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a dense, mat-forming habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for use in xeriscaping."
