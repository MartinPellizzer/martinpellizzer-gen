    "intro": "Bursera palmeri var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth bursera, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert region of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and small, simple leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is also noted for its role in providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
