    "intro": "Boeicopsis, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often bioluminescent or glowing flowers that appear at night. Boeicopsis species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive lantern-like shape. The genus is native to parts of Asia and is of interest to botanists due to its unusual floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
