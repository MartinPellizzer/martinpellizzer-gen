    "intro": "Buchanania halmaheirae, commonly known as the Malabar Buchanania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
