    "intro": "Bilgea sandrasica, commonly known as the sandrasica bilgea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with narrow, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bilgea sandrasica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
