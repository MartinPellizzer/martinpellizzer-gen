    "intro": "Botschantzevia karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Botschantzevia karatavica is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
