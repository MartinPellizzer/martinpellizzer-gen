    "intro": "Bulbophyllum microblepharon, commonly known as the small-eyed bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, and it has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs. This species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
