    "intro": "Blechnum polypodioides var. holstii, commonly known as the Holst's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
