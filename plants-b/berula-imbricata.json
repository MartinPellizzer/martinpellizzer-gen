    "intro": "Berula imbricata, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that produce broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Berula imbricata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
