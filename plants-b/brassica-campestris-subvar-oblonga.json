It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a rosette of elongated, fleshy leaves that are often used in Asian cuisine. It thrives in cool climates and is cultivated for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have a slightly bitter taste.
