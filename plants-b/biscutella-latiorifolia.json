    "intro": "Biscutella latiorifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Biscutella latiorifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
