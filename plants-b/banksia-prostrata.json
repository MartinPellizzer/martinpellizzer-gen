    "intro": "Banksia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate banksia, is a low-growing shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It features dense, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the base of the plant, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant has tough, leathery leaves that are usually grey-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are yellow with prominent, cone-like structures that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Banksia prostrata is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its underground stems after bushfires."
