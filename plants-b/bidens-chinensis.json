    "intro": "Bidens chinensis, commonly known as Chinese ironweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist environments, including wetlands and marshes, and is often found in the wild along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Bidens chinensis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
