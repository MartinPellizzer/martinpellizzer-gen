    "intro": "Bucholzia obovata, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. Bucholzia obovata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and riverine habitats."
