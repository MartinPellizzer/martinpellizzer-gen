    "intro": "Benthamantha painteri, commonly known as the painter's benthamantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by vibrant, showy leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Benthamantha painteri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
