    "intro": "Bonifacia riparia, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit with small, oval leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of leaves and tiny, scale-like structures along the stems. It is often found in wetlands, along the edges of ponds, and in streams. Bonifacia riparia plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
