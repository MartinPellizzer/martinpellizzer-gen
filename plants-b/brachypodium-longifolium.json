    "intro": "Brachypodium longifolium, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its small, spike-like flowers are typically green or pale yellow, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Brachypodium longifolium is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
