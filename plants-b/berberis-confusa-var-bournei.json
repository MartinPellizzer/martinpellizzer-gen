    "intro": "Berberis confusa var. bournei, commonly known as the Bornean barberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
