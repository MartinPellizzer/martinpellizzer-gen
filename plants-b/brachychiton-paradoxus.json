    "intro": "Brachychiton paradoxus, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a unique deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The tree has broad, palmate leaves and produces showy, lantern-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The plant is also known for its ability to shed its leaves during dry seasons, conserving moisture."
