It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Baccharis vulneraria is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
