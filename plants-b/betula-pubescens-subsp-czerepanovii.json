It is characterized by its white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in taiga and subarctic regions. The subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
