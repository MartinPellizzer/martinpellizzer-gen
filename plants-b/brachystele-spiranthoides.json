    "intro": "Brachystele spiranthoides, commonly known as the spiral spike moss, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ptychopetalaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces delicate, spirally arranged inflorescences that give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Brachystele spiranthoides is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
