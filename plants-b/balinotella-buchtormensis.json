It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Balinotella buchtormensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
