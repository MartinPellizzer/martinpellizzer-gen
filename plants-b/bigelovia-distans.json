    "intro": "Bigelovia distans, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of the common dandelion, followed by small, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Bigelovia distans is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
