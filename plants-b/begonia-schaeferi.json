It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy texture and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid environments. It thrives in indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for collectors and indoor gardeners alike."
