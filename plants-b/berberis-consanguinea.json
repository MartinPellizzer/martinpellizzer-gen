    "intro": "Berberis consanguinea, commonly known as the red barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnate. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting berries, which attract birds and provide winter interest."
