    "intro": "Bromelia rubra, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many tropical plants with showy inflorescences. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy, evergreen leaves that can reach up to 2 feet in length. Its vibrant red flowers bloom in the center of the leaf rosette, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Bromelia rubra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
