    "intro": "Bauhinia huberi, commonly known as the velvet bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for horticultural use. Bauhinia huberi is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments."
