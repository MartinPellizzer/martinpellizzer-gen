    "intro": "Bassia biflora, commonly known as silverleaf flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture that further aids in reducing water loss. Bassia biflora is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
