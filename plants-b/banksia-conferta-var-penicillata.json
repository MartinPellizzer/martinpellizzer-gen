    "intro": "Banksia conferta var. penicillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce abundant yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a distinctive midrib, and they are arranged in spirals along the stems. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
