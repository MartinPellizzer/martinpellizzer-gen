    "intro": "Baptisia lactea var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping false indigo, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of bright blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens to support local pollinators."
