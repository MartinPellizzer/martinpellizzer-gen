    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hamatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their vibrant color."
