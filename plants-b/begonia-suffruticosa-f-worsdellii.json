    "intro": "Begonia suffruticosa f. worsdellii, commonly known as the Worsdell's begonia, is a compact, shrub-like perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with prominent red stamens, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
