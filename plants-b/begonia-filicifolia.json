    "intro": "Begonia filicifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that resemble fern fronds, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often grown as a decorative houseplant. Its ornamental value comes from both its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
