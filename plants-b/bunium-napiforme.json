    "intro": "Bunium napiforme, commonly known as the bulbous fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rootstock that resembles a bulb, which is often harvested for its aromatic properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive anise-like fragrance. Bunium napiforme is valued in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits."
