    "intro": "Begonia malachosticta, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
