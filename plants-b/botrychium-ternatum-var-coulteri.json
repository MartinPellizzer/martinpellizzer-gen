It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble those of a fern, with a unique structure that includes a sporangiophore bearing spore capsules. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a limited geographic distribution, primarily in the western United States. The plant plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
