    "intro": "Biscutella apula var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar biscutella, is a rare and unique variant of the biscutella genus. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more spreading form of the species. The plant typically features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
