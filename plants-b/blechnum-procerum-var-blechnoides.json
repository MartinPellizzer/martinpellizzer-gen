    "intro": "Blechnum procerum var. blechnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hair, which helps in water retention. This variety is distinguished by its narrower and more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Blechnum procerum."
