    "intro": "Brachystegia pruinosa, commonly known as the white stinkwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that often appears whitish due to a waxy coating. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a hairy underside, and the tree produces small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and forest areas. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and has cultural significance in some regions."
