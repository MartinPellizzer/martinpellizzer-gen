    "intro": "Bermudiana, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a sprawling growth habit that forms a dense turf. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and withstand drought conditions. It is widely used for lawns, pastures, and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability. Bermudiana also has a high tolerance for heat and can recover quickly from damage."
