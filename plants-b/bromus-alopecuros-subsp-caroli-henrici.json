    "intro": "Bromus alopecuros subsp. caroli-henrici, commonly known as the Caroli-Henrici brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the tip of the stem, which contains small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
