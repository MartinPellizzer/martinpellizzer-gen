    "intro": "Bouchea cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flower colors and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Bouchea cuneifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
