    "intro": "Betula humilis f. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a shrub-like form of the dwarf birch. It is characterized by its obovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant typically grows in cold, boreal or alpine environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh climatic conditions."
