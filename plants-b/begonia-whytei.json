    "intro": "Begonia whytei, commonly known as the White's begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
