    "intro": "Bryonopsis laciniosa var. typica, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in tiny bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a spike, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. The species is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
