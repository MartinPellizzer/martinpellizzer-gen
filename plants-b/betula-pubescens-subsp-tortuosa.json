    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its white to yellowish bark, which peels in thin, papery layers, and its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in taiga and alpine environments. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh climates and is an important component of boreal ecosystems."
