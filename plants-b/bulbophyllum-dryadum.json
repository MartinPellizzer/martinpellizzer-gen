It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and dense clusters of dark green leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow lip, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
