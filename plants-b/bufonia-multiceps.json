    "intro": "Bufonia multiceps, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a large, edible fungus that belongs to the family Agaricaceae. It is characterized by its white, spongy cap that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, and a stem that is usually shorter than the cap. The fruiting body develops from a spherical, smooth, white mycelium that emerges from the ground. It is typically found in grassy areas, woodlands, and along roadsides, especially in temperate regions. The spores are released from the underside of the cap, which is initially covered with a membranous veil that breaks as the fungus matures."
