    "intro": "Bassia uniflora, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Bassia uniflora plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects."
