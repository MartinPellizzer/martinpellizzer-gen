    "intro": "Bolbitis cuspidata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features long, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
