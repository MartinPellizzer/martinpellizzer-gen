    "intro": "Bupleurum atlanticum var. mairei, commonly known as the Atlantic Bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and can reach depths of up to 30 cm, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
