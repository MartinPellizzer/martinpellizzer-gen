    "intro": "Betula alba var. tauschii, commonly known as the white birch variant, is a subspecies of the white birch native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and white, similar to the parent species, but it may show more fissures with age. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
