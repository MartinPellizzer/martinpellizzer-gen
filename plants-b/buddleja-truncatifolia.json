    "intro": "Buddleja truncatifolia, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to lilac. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Buddleja truncatifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
