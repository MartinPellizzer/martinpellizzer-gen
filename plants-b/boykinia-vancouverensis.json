    "intro": "Boykinia vancouverensis, commonly known as Vancouver rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
