    "intro": "Biovularia, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, fleshy body. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Biovularia is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
