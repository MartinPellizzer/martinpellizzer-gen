    "intro": "Blechnum capense, commonly known as the Cape holly fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
