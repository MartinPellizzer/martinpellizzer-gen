    "intro": "Brachystelma incanum, commonly known as the silver starling cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
