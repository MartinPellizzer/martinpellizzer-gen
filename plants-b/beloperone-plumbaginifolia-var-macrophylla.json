It belongs to the Plumbaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
