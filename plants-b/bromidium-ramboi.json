    "intro": "Bromidium ramboi, commonly known as the Rambo's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bromidium ramboi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
