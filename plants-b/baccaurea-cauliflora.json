    "intro": "Baccaurea cauliflora, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the bark of the trunk and branches. The plant produces edible, segmented fruits with a bright red or purple exterior and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, often with a glossy surface. The plant is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
