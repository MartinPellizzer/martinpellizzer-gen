    "intro": "Begonia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, fleshy leaves that often resemble miniature hearts or shields. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia floribunda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
