    "intro": "Burlingtonia pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf burlingtonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often followed by yellowish, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
