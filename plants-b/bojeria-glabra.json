    "intro": "Bojeria glabra, commonly known as the smooth bojeria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Bojeria glabra is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
