    "intro": "Brunia palustris, commonly known as the marsh heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. Brunia palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and color to damp garden areas."
