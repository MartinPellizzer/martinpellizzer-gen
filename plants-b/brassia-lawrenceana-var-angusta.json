    "intro": "Brassia lawrenceana var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed brassia, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The varietal form, angusta, distinguishes it from other Brassia species by its more compact growth habit and narrower foliage."
