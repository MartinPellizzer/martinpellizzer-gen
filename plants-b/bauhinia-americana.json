    "intro": "Bauhinia americana, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for ferns due to their delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Bauhinia americana is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
