    "intro": "Betula cylindrostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a pale underside. It produces small, clustered catkins that are yellow-green in color, typical of the Betula genus. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
