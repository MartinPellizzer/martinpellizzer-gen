    "intro": "Blechnum virginicum, commonly known as the Virgin's brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually found on the underside of the leaves."
