    "intro": "Brachyderea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine brachyderea, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are usually pale yellow to white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
