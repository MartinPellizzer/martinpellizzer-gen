    "intro": "Bougainvillea patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian Bougainvillea, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers that are less showy than the bracts. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Bougainvillea patagonica is relatively drought-tolerant and can grow in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile choice for gardens and landscapes."
