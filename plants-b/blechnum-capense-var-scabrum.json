    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. scabrum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
