    "intro": "Buphthalmum silphioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Buphthalmum silphioides is adapted to arid environments and is considered a valuable species for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
