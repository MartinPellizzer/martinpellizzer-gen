    "intro": "Betula ermanii subvar. brevidentata, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, often twisted branches that form a rounded or weeping shape. The leaves are elliptical, dark green on top, and pale underneath, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and pale, often with a reddish or pinkish hue. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique form and seasonal color changes."
