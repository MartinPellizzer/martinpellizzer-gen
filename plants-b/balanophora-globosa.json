    "intro": "Balanophora globosa, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a holoparasite. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy, globular structure and lacks true leaves. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Balanophora globosa is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the roots of other plants in dense forests."
