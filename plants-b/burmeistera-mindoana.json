    "intro": "Burmeistera mindoana, commonly known as the Mindoan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Burmeistera mindoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
