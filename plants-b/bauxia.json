    "intro": "Bauxia, commonly known as the \"sweet scented bauxia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. Bauxia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with simple, opposite leaves that are often glandular and emit a pleasant fragrance. The flowers are usually clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences, and the fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Bauxia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrance and visual beauty."
