    "intro": "Buxus papillosa, commonly known as the woolly boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered with fine, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and leathery, with a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. This plant is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to form compact, decorative shapes."
