    "intro": "Bignonia crucifera, commonly known as the crossvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the corolla, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and along fences."
