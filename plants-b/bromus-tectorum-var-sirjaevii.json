    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. sirjaevii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill brome, is a variant of the downy brome, native to the western United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is often found in open areas such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed sites. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a common invasive species in certain regions."
