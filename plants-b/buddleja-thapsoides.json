    "intro": "Buddleja thapsoides, commonly known as the woolly leaved buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features soft, gray-green foliage that is covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Buddleja thapsoides is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal maintenance."
