    "intro": "Brassia rolandoi, commonly known as the Rolando's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Brassia rolandoi is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
