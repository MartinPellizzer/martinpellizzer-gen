    "intro": "Bupleurum karglii f. patulum, commonly known as the Kargli's Bupleurum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, finely divided leaves, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
