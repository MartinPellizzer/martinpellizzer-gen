    "intro": "Begonia brachyclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Begonia brachyclada thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or container cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
