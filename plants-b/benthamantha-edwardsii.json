    "intro": "Benthamantha edwardsii, commonly known as the Edwards' benthamantha, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features include a slender stem and aromatic foliage, which may contribute to its ecological role in supporting local insect populations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
