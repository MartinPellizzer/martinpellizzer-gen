    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 longicyma, commonly known as the hybrid begonia, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia pendula. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors such as red, pink, and white. The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia \u00d7 longicyma is popular in hanging baskets and as a bedding plant due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
