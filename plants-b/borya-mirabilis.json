    "intro": "Borya mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its blooming period occurs in the early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems. Borya mirabilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
