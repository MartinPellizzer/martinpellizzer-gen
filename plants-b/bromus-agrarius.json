    "intro": "Bromus agrarius, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and agricultural fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic invasive species in some regions."
