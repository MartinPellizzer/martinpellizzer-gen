    "intro": "Bolbitis appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged, with a creeping rhizome that helps it spread. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis appendiculata is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled water conditions."
