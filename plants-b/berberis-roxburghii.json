It features spiny stems and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
