    "intro": "Blepharis decussata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
