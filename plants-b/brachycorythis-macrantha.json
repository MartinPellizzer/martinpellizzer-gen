    "intro": "Brachycorythis macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, feathery leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. Its striking, showy inflorescences produce both male and female cones, typical of cycads. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
