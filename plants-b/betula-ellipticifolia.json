    "intro": "Betula ellipticifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a slight reddish tint, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Betula ellipticifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
