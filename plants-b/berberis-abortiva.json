    "intro": "Berberis abortiva, commonly known as the red barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
