    "intro": "Berlinia bifoliolata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive two-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Berlinia bifoliolata is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
