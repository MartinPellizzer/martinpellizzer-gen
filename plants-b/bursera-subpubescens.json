    "intro": "Bursera subpubescens, commonly known as the white bark bursera, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by spherical fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bursera subpubescens is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
