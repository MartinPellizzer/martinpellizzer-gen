    "intro": "Bulbophyllum concolor, commonly known as the uniform orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which is typical for many orchid species. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
