It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy, waxy texture. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and climbing habit."
