    "intro": "Blepharocalyx divaricatus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the rare-flowered wax tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
