    "intro": "Blechnum humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. The fronds are evergreen and can remain viable for several years, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
