    "intro": "Bambusa jacobsii, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a clumping bamboo species native to southern China. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green culms, which contrast strikingly with its dark green leaves. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit, making it ideal for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Bambusa jacobsii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique coloration and ease of maintenance."
