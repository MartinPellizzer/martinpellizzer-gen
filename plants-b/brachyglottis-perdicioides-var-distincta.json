    "intro": "Brachyglottis perdicioides var. distincta, commonly known as the Cook Strait bristlebush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, wiry branches covered in small, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive bristly appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly serrated edge. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. This variety is adapted to coastal and dry inland environments, showing resilience to harsh conditions."
