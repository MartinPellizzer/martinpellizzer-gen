    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine moonwort, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Botrychium lunaria subsp. alpina is a rare and specialized species, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
