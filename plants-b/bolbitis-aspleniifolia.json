    "intro": "Bolbitis aspleniifolia, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Bolbitis aspleniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
