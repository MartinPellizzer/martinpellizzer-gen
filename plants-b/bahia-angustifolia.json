    "intro": "Bahia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bahia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and sandy regions. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental use. The plant's ability to spread through rhizomes allows it to form dense mats, which can help suppress weeds in disturbed areas."
