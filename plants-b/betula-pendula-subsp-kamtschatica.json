    "intro": "Betula pendula subsp. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in mountainous or taiga regions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
