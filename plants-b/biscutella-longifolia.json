    "intro": "Biscutella longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
