    "intro": "Bolbitis nitens, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on the forest floor. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in the understory of humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Bolbitis nitens plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
