    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fibrinum, commonly known as the fibrous orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, fibrous root system that helps it anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat. Bulbophyllum fibrinum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
