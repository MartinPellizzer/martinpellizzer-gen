It is a small, annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into red, spherical fruits similar to domestic tomatoes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. This species is considered an important ancestor in the domestication of modern tomatoes."
