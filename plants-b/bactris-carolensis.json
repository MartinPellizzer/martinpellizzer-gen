    "intro": "Bactris carolensis, commonly known as the Carolinian palm, is a small, slender palm native to the Caribbean islands. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters and has a clustered growth habit with several stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a feathery appearance. Bactris carolensis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions."
