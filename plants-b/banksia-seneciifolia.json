    "intro": "Banksia seneciifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flower spikes in late winter to early spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody cone-like structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Banksia seneciifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is a valuable component of the region's biodiversity."
