It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
