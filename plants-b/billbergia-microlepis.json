    "intro": "Billbergia microlepis, commonly known as the miniature billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia microlepis is popular as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
