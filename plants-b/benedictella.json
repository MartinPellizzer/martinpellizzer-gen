    "intro": "Benedictella, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Nelumbonaceae. These aquatic plants are native to the wetlands of Asia and are characterized by their large, showy flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often floating on the water's surface. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, bloom in a sequential pattern, opening at different times to attract pollinators. Benedictella has cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries, particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism."
