    "intro": "Biermannia jainiana, commonly known as the Jainia orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure and are pollinated primarily by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Biermannia jainiana is considered a species of conservation concern."
