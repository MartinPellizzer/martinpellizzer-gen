It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a scabrous surface, which is a defining feature of this variety. It is often found in moist, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in ecological restoration projects."
