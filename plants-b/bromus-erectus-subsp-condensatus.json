It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, awned spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
