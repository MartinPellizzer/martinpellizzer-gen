    "intro": "Brachiaria ciliaris, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Brachiaria ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
