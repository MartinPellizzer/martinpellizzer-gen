    "intro": "Bromus catharticus var. striatus, commonly known as the striped smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct stripe patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
