It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
