It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clustering of pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
