    "intro": "Banksia audax, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces woody follicles that contain seeds. Banksia audax thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
