    "intro": "Begonia glaucophylla var. scandens, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a trailing perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its trailing growth habit makes it popular for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
