    "intro": "Bulbophyllum devangiriense, commonly known as the Devangiri orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
