    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum subsp. meridionale, commonly known as the southern moonwort, is a fern-like fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, two-part sporophyll structure, with the upper portion resembling a broad, shield-like leaf and the lower part bearing the spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are released from the lower sporophyll, which is often covered in a protective sheath. This subspecies is native to the southeastern United States and is considered a rare and delicate plant."
