It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streambanks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
