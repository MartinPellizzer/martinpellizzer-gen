    "intro": "Botrychium rutaceum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a fleshy, club-shaped rhizome and a pair of fiddlehead-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like formation on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium rutaceum is a perennial plant that plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
