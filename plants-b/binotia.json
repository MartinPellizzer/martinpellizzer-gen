    "intro": "Binotia, commonly known as the two-toned orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often colorful flowers that display a striking two-toned appearance, typically with contrasting colors on the upper and lower petals. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrive in humid, shaded environments. Binotia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in the biodiversity of their native ecosystems."
