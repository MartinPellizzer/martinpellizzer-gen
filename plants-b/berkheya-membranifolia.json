    "intro": "Berkheya membranifolia, commonly known as the paperbark dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive papery, fibrous bark that peels away easily, giving it its common name. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Berkheya membranifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
