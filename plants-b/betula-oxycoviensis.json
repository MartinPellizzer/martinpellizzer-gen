    "intro": "Betula oxycoviensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The bark of this species is smooth and grayish-white, with a tendency to peel in thin, papery layers as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
