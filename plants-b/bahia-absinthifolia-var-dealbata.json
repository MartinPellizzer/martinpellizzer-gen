    "intro": "Bahia absinthifolia var. dealbata, commonly known as silverleaf bahia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves with a soft, velvety texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
