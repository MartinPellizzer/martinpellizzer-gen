    "intro": "Bidens cronquistii, commonly known as the yellow beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
