    "intro": "Breweria capensis var. minor, commonly known as the Cape brewer's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
