It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks, and are typically ovate in shape. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
