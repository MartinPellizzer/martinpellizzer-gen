    "intro": "Betula alba var. verrucosa, commonly known as the warty birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive warty bark. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, turning yellow in autumn. Its bark becomes thick and furrowed with age, developing a rough, warty texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
