    "intro": "Bruguiera littorea, commonly known as the mangrove buttonwood, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense mangrove forests. The plant has aerial roots called pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soil. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces woody, buoyant seeds that disperse via water. Bruguiera littorea plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
