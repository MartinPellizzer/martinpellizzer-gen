    "intro": "Banksia spinulosa var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's banksia, is a shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cone-like structures that contain the hard, woody seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by fire. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
