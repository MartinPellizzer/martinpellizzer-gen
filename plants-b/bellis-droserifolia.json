    "intro": "Bellis droserifolia, commonly known as the sticky bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
