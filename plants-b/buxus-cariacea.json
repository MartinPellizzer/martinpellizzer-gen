    "intro": "Buxus cariacea, commonly known as the Ceylon boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the island of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage consisting of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Buxus cariacea is often used in horticulture for topiary and as a decorative plant due to its ability to maintain a neat, sculptural shape."
