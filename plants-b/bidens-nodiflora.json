    "intro": "Bidens nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Bidens nodiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it both a weed and a valuable plant for ecological restoration."
