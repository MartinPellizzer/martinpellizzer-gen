    "intro": "Bauhinia didyma, commonly known as the jeweled orchid tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and clusters of showy, orchid-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia didyma thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant splash of color to gardens and landscapes."
