It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
