    "intro": "Blechnum rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's spleenwort, is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce new fronds. Its fronds are usually bi-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a dark green, glossy appearance. Blechnum rimbachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
