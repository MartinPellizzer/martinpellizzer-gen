    "intro": "Borneocola stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed boreno, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
