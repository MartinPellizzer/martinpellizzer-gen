    "intro": "Blepharis villosa, commonly known as the hairy blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Blepharis villosa is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
