    "intro": "Bombax tussacii, commonly known as the Tussacii silk cotton tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or red. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a three-lobed capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Bombax tussacii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
