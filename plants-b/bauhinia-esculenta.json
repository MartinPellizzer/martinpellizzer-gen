It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant is notable for its edible pods, which contain seeds encased in a fibrous, gelatinous pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some cultures. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
