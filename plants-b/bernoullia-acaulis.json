    "intro": "Bernoullia acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed bellflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or pink, depending on the species. Its leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, arranged alternately along the stem. Bernoullia acaulis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
