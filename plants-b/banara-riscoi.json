    "intro": "Banara riscoi, commonly known as the Risco's banara, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
