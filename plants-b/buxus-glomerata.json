    "intro": "Buxus glomerata, commonly known as common boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western and central Europe. It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is widely cultivated as a hedge or topiary plant due to its tolerance of pruning. Buxus glomerata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for ornamental gardening."
