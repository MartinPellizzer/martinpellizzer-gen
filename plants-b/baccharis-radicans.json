    "intro": "Baccharis radicans, commonly known as creeping baccharis, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Baccharis radicans is often found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and wetlands."
