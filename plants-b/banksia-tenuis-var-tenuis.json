    "intro": "Banksia tenuis var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces distinctive woody cones that persist on the plant for years, releasing seeds when the cones open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
