    "intro": "Bougainvillea berberidifolia, commonly known as the Mexican flame bush, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant clusters of papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, inconspicuous true flowers inside the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea berberidifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
