    "intro": "Betula barguzinensis, commonly known as the Barguzin birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with doubly serrated margins, and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions."
