It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Baeckea frutescens is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
