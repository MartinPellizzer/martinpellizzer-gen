    "intro": "Borreria verbenoides f. secunda, commonly known as the silverleaf borreria, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. Its small, tubular flowers are typically white or pale pink and are arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and thorny scrublands."
