    "intro": "Baccharis ibitipocensis, commonly known as the Ibitipoc\u00e9 baccharis, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian forests and wetlands. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
