    "intro": "Braya purpurascens var. dubia, commonly known as the purple-stemmed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is distinguished from other Braya species by its distinctive purplish stems and specific geographic distribution."
