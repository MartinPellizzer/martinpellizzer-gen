    "intro": "Bauhinia prainiana, commonly known as the white bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into small, delicate leaflets. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Bauhinia prainiana is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
