    "intro": "Beauprea multijuga, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in moist, well-drained soils. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in seed dispersal by attracting nocturnal pollinators."
