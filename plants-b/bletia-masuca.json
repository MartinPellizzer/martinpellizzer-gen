It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bletia masuca is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
