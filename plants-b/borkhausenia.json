It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. These plants are characterized by their woody stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are typically fig-like, enclosed in a tough, fleshy capsule. Borkhausenia species are often found in rocky or arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions."
