    "intro": "Baccharis pellucida, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Baccharis pellucida is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
