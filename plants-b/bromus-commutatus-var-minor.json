    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a range of soil types."
