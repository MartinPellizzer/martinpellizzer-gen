It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. This epiphytic orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
