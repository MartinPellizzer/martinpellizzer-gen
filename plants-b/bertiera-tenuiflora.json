    "intro": "Bertiera tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered bertiera, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant is adapted to survive in low-water environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Bertiera tenuiflora is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
