    "intro": "Brachiaria grossaria, commonly known as rough brachiaria, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or pastures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
