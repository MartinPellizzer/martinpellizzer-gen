    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fragosum, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, resembling flames. The plant has fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
