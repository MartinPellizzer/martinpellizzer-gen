It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Bastardiastrum cinctum is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions."
