It is a vigorous climber with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Bignonia clematis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in gardens and as a vine in landscaping."
