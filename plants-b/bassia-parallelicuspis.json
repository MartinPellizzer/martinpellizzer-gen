    "intro": "Bassia parallelicuspis, commonly known as the parallel-cusped goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store moisture, making it well-suited for harsh, drought-prone habitats. It is often found in disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural areas."
