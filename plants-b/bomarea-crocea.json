It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features slender, climbing stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by hummingbirds. Bomarea crocea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in shaded, moist environments."
