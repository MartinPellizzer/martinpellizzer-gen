    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. sinuatum, commonly known as the sinuous moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually divided into lobes, and the sporangia are arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern. This variety is known for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
