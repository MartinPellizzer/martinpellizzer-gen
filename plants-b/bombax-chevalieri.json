    "intro": "Bombax chevalieri, commonly known as the African silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine and for its fibers."
