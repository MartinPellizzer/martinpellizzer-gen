    "intro": "Braya rosea var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, glabrous leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
