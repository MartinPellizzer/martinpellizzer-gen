    "intro": "Buxus ichagensis, commonly known as the Korean boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Korea. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant typically reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has a rounded, bushy form. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Buxus ichagensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate pruning, making it suitable for topiary and garden borders."
