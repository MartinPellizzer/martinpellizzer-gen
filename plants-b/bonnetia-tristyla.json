    "intro": "Bonnetia tristyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and Easter Island. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal or dry forest habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Bonnetia tristyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
