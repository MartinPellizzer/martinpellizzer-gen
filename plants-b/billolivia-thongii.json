    "intro": "Billolivia thongii, commonly known as the Thai ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Thailand. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, producing a delicate, almost ethereal fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
