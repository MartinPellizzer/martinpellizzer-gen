    "intro": "Bolbitis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features a slender, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with finely toothed margins and a pale green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Due to its fragile nature, it is seldom seen in the wild outside of its specific habitat."
