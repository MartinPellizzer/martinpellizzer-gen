    "intro": "Bromus himalaicus var. grandis, commonly known as the Himalayan brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
