    "intro": "Betula sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish layer beneath, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and tundra regions. Betula sibirica is also notable for its ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
