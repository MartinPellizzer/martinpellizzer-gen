    "intro": "Bikkia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and they produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Bikkia species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and the presence of a milky sap when the stems are broken."
