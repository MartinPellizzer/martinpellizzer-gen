It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. The tree is also valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and carving."
