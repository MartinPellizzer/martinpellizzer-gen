    "intro": "Bumelia chrysophylloides, commonly known as the golden-leaf bumelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Bumelia chrysophylloides is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
