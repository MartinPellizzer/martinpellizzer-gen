    "intro": "Bidens andicola var. decomposita, commonly known as the decomposing bidens, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant features small, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture. It plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing quickly after flowering, contributing to soil fertility. This species is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it an indicator of ecological succession."
