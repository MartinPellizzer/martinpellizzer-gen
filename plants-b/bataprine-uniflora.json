    "intro": "Bataprine uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bataprine, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth surface with a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
