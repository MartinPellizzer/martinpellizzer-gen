    "intro": "Bermudiana septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. This plant is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which contribute to soil conservation. Bermudiana septentrionalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
