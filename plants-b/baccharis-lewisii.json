It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. It has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Baccharis lewisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
