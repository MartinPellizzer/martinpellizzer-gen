    "intro": "Bladhia crenata f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited bladhia, is a variant of the bladhia crenata species, which belongs to the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow fruits, which set it apart from the typical green-fruited form. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with wavy margins, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. This botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in horticultural and botanical studies."
