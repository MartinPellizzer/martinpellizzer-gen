    "intro": "Betula grandis, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery strips, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has slender, pendulous branches. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula grandis produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions."
