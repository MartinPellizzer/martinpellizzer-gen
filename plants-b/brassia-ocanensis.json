    "intro": "Brassia ocanensis, commonly known as the Ocanense orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss. Brassia ocanensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
