It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ephemeral nature, it is sometimes referred to as a transient species, blooming briefly before going dormant."
