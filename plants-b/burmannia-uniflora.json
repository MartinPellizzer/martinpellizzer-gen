    "intro": "Burmannia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower burmannia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous species that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive, fleshy structure that attracts pollinators. The leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions."
