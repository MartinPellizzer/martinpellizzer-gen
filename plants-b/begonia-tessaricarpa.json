    "intro": "Begonia tessaricarpa, commonly known as the four-seed begonia, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by unique four-seeded capsules that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found in commercial horticulture."
