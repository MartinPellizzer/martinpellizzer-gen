    "intro": "Begonia lilliputana, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it one of the smallest begonia species. It prefers shady, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Due to its size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for miniature gardens and terrariums."
