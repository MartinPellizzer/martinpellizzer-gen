    "intro": "Burckella fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Fiji. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
