    "intro": "Braya humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that store water and a shallow root system for efficient nutrient uptake. Braya humilis is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine and desert ecosystems."
