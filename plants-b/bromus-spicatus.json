    "intro": "Bromus spicatus, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces dense clusters of spikelets at the top of the stem. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Bromus spicatus is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession due to its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly."
