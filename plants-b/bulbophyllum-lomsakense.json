    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lomsakense, commonly known as the Lomsak's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white to yellowish hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in inflorescences that can range from yellow to greenish-white in color. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
