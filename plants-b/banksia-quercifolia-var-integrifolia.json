    "intro": "Banksia quercifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded inflorescences that produce yellow to orange flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are broad, leathery, and have a distinctive serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar and shelter for wildlife."
