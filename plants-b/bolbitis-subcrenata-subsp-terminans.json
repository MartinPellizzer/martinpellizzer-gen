    "intro": "Bolbitis subcrenata subsp. terminans, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with a distinctive, crinkled appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that gives it a rugged look. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
