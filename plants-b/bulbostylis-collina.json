    "intro": "Bulbostylis collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with stable hydrological conditions."
