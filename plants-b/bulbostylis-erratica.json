It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing close to the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
