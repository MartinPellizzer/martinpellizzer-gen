    "intro": "Baccharis ramiflora var. squarrulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its grayish, rough-textured leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It often grows in rocky or sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland desert areas. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in arid environments."
