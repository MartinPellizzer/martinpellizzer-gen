    "intro": "Brasiliorchis ubatubana, commonly known as the Ubatuba orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated pseudobulbs and slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, producing white to pale pink flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
