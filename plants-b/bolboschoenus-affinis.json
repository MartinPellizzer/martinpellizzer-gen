    "intro": "Bolboschoenus affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and the presence of bulb-like structures called bulbils, which aid in vegetative reproduction. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it plays an important role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Bolboschoenus affinis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
