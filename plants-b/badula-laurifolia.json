    "intro": "Badula laurifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf laurel, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Badula laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
