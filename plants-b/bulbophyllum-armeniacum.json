    "intro": "Bulbophyllum armeniacum, commonly known as the Armenian torch orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers with a distinctive torch-like shape, which bloom during the dry season. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts worldwide."
