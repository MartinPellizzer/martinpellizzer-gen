    "intro": "Biarum tenuifolium subsp. idomenaeum, commonly known as the Idomenaeum bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white, often with a violet or purple tinge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base, and it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
