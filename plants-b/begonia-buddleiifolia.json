    "intro": "Begonia buddleiifolia, commonly known as the leafy begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to shades of red and purple. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect light to prevent leaf scorching. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among gardeners and collectors for its unique foliage and floral display."
