    "intro": "Bromopsis frondosa, commonly known as the fronded bromus, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Bromopsis frondosa is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it can form dense stands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
