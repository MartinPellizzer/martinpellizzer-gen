    "intro": "Butea balansae, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, giving the plant its dramatic appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Butea balansae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
