It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and branched, thorny stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
