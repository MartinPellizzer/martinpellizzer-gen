    "intro": "Bromus vogulicus, commonly known as the Vogul grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and the northern regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Bromus vogulicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
