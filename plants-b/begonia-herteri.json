    "intro": "Begonia herteri, commonly known as the Herter's begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its attractive, often vibrant foliage and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Begonia herteri is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
