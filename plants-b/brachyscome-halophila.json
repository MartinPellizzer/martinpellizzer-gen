    "intro": "Brachyscome halophila, commonly known as the saltbush daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. This species is adapted to saline environments, making it a halophyte capable of thriving in coastal and arid regions. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Brachyscome halophila plays a role in stabilizing soils in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or salt-affected soils."
