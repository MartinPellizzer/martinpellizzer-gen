The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its blooming period is brief, typically occurring during the late spring to early summer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Benkara depauperata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
