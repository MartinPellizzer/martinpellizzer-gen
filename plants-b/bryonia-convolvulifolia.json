    "intro": "Bryonia convolvulifolia, commonly known as the creeping bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. Its stems are covered in small, hooked spines, which aid in its climbing habit and contribute to its common name. Bryonia convolvulifolia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
