    "intro": "Bauhinia polystachya, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that appear in clusters during the dry season. The tree has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments, and its bark is smooth and often fissured. Bauhinia polystachya thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant floral display. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
