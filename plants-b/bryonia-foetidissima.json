    "intro": "Bryonia foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange-yellow fruits. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern herbal practices."
