It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity.
