    "intro": "Byrsonima morii, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *cereja-brasileira*, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. Its fruits are edible, though often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
