It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a compact head, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small yellow flowers in the early summer. It is a biennial plant, though it is often grown as an annual in agricultural settings. The leaves are used in various culinary applications, including stir-fries and soups, and are valued for their mild, slightly peppery flavor."
