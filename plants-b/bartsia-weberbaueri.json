    "intro": "Bartsia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Bartsia weberbaueri is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with reduced foliage and a reliance on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
