    "intro": "Betula palmata var. bircalensis, commonly known as the Bircalensis birch, is a rare and specialized variant of the birch tree found in specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, palmate leaves that are adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant exhibits a unique growth form, with a low, shrub-like structure that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. Its bark is smooth and often displays a pale, almost white color, which provides some insulation against extreme weather. This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its fragile mountainous habitat."
