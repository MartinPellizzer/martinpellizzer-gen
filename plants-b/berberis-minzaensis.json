It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
