    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. zomboriensis, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a grass species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting local vegetation."
