    "intro": "Besleria ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are pollinated by birds and insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Its foliage is evergreen, with dark green, glossy leaves that add to its visual appeal."
