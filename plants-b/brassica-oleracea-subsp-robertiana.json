    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subsp. robertiana, commonly known as the purple sprouting broccoli, is a cool-season crop characterized by its dense, compact inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small, tightly packed broccoli heads. The plant produces edible florets that are typically purple or violet in color, which develop from the terminal buds and are surrounded by leafy stems. It is a biennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and culinary versatility. The botanical features of this subspecies include a robust root system and a rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that surround the developing flower clusters. Its growth pattern and morphological traits make it distinct from other members of the Brassica genus."
