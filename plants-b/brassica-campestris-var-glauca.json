    "intro": "Brassica campestris var. glauca, commonly known as the purple sprouting broccoli, is a cultivar of the cabbage family. It is characterized by its compact, cabbage-like heads and clusters of small, edible florets that develop a vibrant purple color as they mature. The plant is typically grown in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is a biennial plant, though it is often treated as an annual in cultivation. Its leaves are edible and can be used in cooking, while the florets are prized for their unique flavor and nutritional value."
