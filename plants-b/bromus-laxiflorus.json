    "intro": "Bromus laxiflorus, commonly known as the slender flowered brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, and the flowers are usually pale green to brown in color. Bromus laxiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
