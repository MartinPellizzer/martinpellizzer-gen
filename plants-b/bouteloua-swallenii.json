    "intro": "Bouteloua swallenii, commonly known as slender false bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch of color to the landscape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an ecologically valuable species in prairie and woodland habitats."
