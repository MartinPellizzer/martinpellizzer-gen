    "intro": "Betula glaebosa, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, which gives it its common name. The tree has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula glaebosa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas."
