    "intro": "Bomarea maakiana, commonly known as the Maak's bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often climb or trail. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bomarea maakiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
