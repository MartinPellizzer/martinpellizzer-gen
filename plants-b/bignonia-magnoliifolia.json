    "intro": "Bignonia magnoliifolia, commonly known as the magnolia vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that resemble those of magnolia trees, hence its common name. The plant produces long, slender stems that can climb or trail, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. Bignonia magnoliifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
