    "intro": "Bucheria saxicola, commonly known as the rock liverwort, is a small, perennial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is often found growing on rocks or in crevices. The plant has a compact growth habit and is typically less than 5 centimeters in height. It is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, where it prefers cool, humid conditions. Bucheria saxicola plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
