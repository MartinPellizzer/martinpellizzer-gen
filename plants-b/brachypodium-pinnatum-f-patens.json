    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum f. patens, commonly known as the spreading false brome, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
