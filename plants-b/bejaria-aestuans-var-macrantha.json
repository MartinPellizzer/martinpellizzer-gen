    "intro": "Bejaria aestuans var. macrantha, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in tidal zones and dune environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for erosion control. The variety macrantha is distinguished by its larger flowers compared to the typical form of Bejaria aestuans."
