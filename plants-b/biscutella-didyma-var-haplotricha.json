    "intro": "Biscutella didyma var. haplotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
