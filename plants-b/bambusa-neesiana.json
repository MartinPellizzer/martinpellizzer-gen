    "intro": "Bambusa neesiana, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a slight sheen. Its rhizomes are thick and capable of producing new shoots, contributing to its rapid growth. Bambusa neesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in construction and as a source of fiber."
