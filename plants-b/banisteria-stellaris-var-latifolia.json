    "intro": "Banisteria stellaris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf star vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth, it requires support structures and careful management to prevent overgrowth."
