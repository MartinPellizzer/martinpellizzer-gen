    "intro": "Blephariglottis psycodes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the fern family, Cyatheaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, silver-green fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with a dense covering of roots, which helps it anchor in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a broad, lance-shaped blade and a prominent midrib. Blephariglottis psycodes thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
