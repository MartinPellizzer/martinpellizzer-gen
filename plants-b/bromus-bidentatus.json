    "intro": "Bromus bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed brome, is a grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields, roadsides, and grasslands. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray glumes. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive two-toothed appearance at the base, giving it its common name. Bromus bidentatus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
