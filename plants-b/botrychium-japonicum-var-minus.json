    "intro": "Botrychium japonicum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad, ovate frond with a distinct, undulating margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the frond, and the plant exhibits a distinct heterosporous reproduction system. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
