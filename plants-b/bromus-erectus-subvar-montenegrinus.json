    "intro": "Bromus erectus subvar. montenegrinus, commonly known as the Montenegro bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to extreme climatic conditions."
