    "intro": "Begonia laciniata subsp. bowringiana, commonly known as the serrated begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its foliage and floral display make it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical collections."
