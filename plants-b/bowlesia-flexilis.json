    "intro": "Bowlesia flexilis, commonly known as the flexible bowlesia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Bowlesia flexilis is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
