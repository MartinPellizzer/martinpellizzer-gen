    "intro": "Begonia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Its foliage is often variegated, adding visual interest even when not in bloom. Begonia serotina is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
