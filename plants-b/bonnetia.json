    "intro": "Bonnetia, commonly known as the bonnetia or velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Bonnetia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats. They play a role in supporting local pollinators and can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
