    "intro": "Blepharizonia, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange inflorescences, which consist of numerous small flowers arranged in a panicle. Blepharizonia species are typically perennial herbs that thrive in a variety of soil types and are often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. They have lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and their flowers attract a wide range of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is valued both for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
