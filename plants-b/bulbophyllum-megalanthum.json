    "intro": "Bulbophyllum megalanthum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The orchid's striking appearance makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
