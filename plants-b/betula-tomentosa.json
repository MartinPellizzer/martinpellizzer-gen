    "intro": "Betula tomentosa, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver inner layer, and its slender, pendulous branches. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula tomentosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
