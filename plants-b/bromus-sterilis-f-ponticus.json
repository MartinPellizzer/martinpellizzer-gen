It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. This plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features."
