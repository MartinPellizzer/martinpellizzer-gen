    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bataanense, commonly known as the Bataan Bulbophyllum, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, yellowish-green to orange-brown blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
