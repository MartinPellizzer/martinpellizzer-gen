    "intro": "Boschniakia rossica f. flavocorollata, commonly known as the yellow-flowered boschniakia, is a rare and striking orchid-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
