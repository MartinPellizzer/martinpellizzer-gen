    "intro": "Blechnum sociale, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. Blechnum sociale is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas."
