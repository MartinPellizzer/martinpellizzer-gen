    "intro": "Begonia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylinder begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical tuberous roots and thick, fleshy leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
