    "intro": "Bulbophyllaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Bulbophyllaria is critically endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
