    "intro": "Berberis cooperi, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features bright yellow foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are dark green in color. It produces red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Berberis cooperi thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
