    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. purpurascens, commonly known as purple cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its tightly packed, violet-colored curds. This variety is valued for its unique coloration, which is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, pigments responsible for the purple hue. The plant typically grows as a biennial, though it is often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates. It thrives in cool weather and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Purple cauliflower is a nutritious vegetable, rich in vitamins and antioxidants, making it a popular choice in health-conscious diets."
