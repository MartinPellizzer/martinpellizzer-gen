It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Binaria hymenaeifolia is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
