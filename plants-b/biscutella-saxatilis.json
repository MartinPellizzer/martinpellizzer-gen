    "intro": "Biscutella saxatilis, commonly known as the rock biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Biscutella saxatilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
