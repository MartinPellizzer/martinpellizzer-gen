    "intro": "Begonia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia grandifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
