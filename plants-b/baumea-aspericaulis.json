    "intro": "Baumea aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough-leaved baumea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. Baumea aspericaulis is often found in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides."
