    "intro": "Baphiopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, often resembling the shape of a ghostly figure. Baphiopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
