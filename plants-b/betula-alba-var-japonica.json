    "intro": "Betula alba var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a variant of the white birch species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elegant form and its distinctive white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual interest throughout the year."
