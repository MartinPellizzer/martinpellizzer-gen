    "intro": "Bulbostylis arenaria, commonly known as sand bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of many members of its family. It is often found in disturbed or open habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy conditions. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it is relatively uncommon and may be of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to arid environments."
