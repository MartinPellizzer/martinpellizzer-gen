    "intro": "Begonia seemanniana var. longistipulacea, commonly known as the long-stippled begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with long, slender stipules that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and greenhouse cultivation."
