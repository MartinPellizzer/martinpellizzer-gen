    "intro": "Bolbosaponaria villosa, commonly known as the woolly milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Bolbosaponaria villosa is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
