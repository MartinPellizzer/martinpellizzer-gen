    "intro": "Bolbitis costata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate. Bolbitis costata is valued in aquascaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
