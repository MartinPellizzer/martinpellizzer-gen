It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of fronds, which gives it a striking and ornamental appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl as they grow. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Bowlesia geniculata is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in shaded garden settings."
