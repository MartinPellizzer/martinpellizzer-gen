    "intro": "Breynia nivosa, commonly known as the snow breynia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, adapting well to arid and saline environments. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it a unique, almost frost-like appearance. Breynia nivosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
