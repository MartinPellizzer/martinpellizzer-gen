    "intro": "Brassia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red sepals and petals, which contrast with its white or pale yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brassia cinnabarina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
