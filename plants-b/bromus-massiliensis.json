    "intro": "Bromus massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilia grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Bromus massiliensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
