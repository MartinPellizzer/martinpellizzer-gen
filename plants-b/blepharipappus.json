    "intro": "Blepharipappus, commonly known as the eyelash dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their small, dandelion-like flowers that are typically yellow in color and arranged in a composite head. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough or hairy texture. Blepharipappus species are native to North America and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They produce lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds with feathery appendages, aiding in their spread."
