    "intro": "Briegeria, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. Briegeria species are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually alternate and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.
