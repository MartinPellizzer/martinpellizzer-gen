    "intro": "Betula purpurea, commonly known as the purple birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its slender, branching habit. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. Betula purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
