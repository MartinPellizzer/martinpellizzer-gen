It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and grass-green, while its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets. Bulbostylis craspedota plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
