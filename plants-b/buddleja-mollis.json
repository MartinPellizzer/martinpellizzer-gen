    "intro": "Buddleja mollis, commonly known as woolly buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which attract a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Buddleja mollis is relatively low maintenance and suitable for gardens in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8."
