    "intro": "Bauera humilis var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the small-bracted bauera, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Australia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, blooming in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforest understoreys. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
