    "intro": "Bulbophyllum crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, spurred petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and hardiness."
