It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking white or pale yellow flowers with showy, elongated bracts. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form a dense network that helps anchor it to its substrate and absorb moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a visually appealing and sought-after orchid for horticultural collections."
