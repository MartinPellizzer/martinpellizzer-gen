    "intro": "Borojoa stipularis, commonly known as the wild cashew, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruiting bodies that resemble cashews but are not edible. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive stipular structure, contributing to its botanical uniqueness. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its potential economic uses."
