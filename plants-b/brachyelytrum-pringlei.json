    "intro": "Brachyelytrum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, stiff leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include small, wind-pollinated flowers and a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Brachyelytrum pringlei is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
