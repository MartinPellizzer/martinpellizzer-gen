    "intro": "Blechnum penna-marina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are typically silver-gray in color due to the dense covering of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The silver fern is not only ecologically significant but also holds cultural importance in M\u0101ori traditions."
