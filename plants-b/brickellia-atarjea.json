    "intro": "Brickellia atarjea, commonly known as silverleaf brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and woodland habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia atarjea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
