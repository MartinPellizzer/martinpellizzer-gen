It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and small, rounded spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color. Brachyachne obtusiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
