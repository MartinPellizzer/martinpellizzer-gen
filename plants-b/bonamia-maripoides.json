    "intro": "Bonamia maripoides, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
