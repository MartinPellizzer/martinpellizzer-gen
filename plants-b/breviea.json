    "intro": "Breviea, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. Breviea species typically feature showy, yellow or golden-colored flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plants have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are often fibrous and adapted to epiphytic growth. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants."
