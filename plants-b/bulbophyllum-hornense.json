    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hornense, commonly known as the Horn's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal droughts. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a variety of colors ranging from white to yellow and pink."
