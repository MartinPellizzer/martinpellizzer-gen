It features elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots help stabilize the substrate, while its foliage provides habitat for small aquatic organisms. Beta sulcata is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
