    "intro": "Bidens humilis var. major, commonly known as the common beggarlice, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread widely. Its botanical features make it a common weed in many regions, though it also serves as a food source for certain insects."
