    "intro": "Besleria racemosa, commonly known as the clustered flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences of bright red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects."
