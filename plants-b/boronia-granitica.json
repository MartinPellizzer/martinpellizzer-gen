    "intro": "Boronia granitica, commonly known as the granite boronia, is a small shrub native to the granite outcrops of southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
