    "intro": "Bursera citronella, commonly known as lemon tree or citrus bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, leathery leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when mature. The fruit is edible, with a juicy, acidic pulp that is often used in local cuisines. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
