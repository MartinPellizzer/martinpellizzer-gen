It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
