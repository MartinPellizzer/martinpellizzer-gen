    "intro": "Bunchosia quaesitor, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
