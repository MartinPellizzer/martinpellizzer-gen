    "intro": "Berlinia grandiflora var. smeathmanii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, almost impenetrable wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often considered a keystone species in its native habitats."
