    "intro": "Betula transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its slender, upright branches. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
