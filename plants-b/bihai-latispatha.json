    "intro": "Bihai latispatha, commonly known as the giant flatleaf cycad, is a distinctive cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique addition to botanical collections. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some regions."
