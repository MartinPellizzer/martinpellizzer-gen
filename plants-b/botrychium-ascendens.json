    "intro": "Botrychium ascendens, commonly known as the ascending moonwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two parts, with the upper portion resembling a broad, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium ascendens is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
