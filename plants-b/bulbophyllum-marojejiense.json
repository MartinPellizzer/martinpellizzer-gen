    "intro": "Bulbophyllum marojejiense, commonly known as the Marojejii orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Kenya. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, making it a visually appealing species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
