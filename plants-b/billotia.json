    "intro": "Billotia, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that often resemble those of the buttercup, with five petals and yellow or white coloration. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Billotia species are often found in acidic, well-drained soils in temperate regions. They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats."
