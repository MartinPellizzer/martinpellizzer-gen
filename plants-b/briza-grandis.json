    "intro": "Briza grandis, commonly known as the greater quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feather-like leaves that sway in the wind. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often mistaken for dandelion fluff, though they are distinct in structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Briza grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
