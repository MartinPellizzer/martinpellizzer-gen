    "intro": "Bellevalia hyacinthoides, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bellevalia hyacinthoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with full sun to partial shade."
