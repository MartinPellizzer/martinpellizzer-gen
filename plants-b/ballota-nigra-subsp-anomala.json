It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive grayish-green color due to their dense pubescence. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
