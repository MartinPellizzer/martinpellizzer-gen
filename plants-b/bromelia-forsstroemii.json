It features a rosette of broad, glossy, dark green leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often adorned with white or pale green markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Bromelia forfstroemii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture."
