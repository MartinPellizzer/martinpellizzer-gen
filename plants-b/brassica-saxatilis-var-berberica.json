It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, yellowish-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
