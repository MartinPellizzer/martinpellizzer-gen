    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tahitense, commonly known as the Tahitian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure, featuring a lip that is often brightly colored. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island habitat."
