    "intro": "Bactris ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are often consumed by local communities. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable species in ecological and horticultural contexts. The leaves are also used in traditional crafts and for thatching."
