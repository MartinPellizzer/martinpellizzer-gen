    "intro": "Bolbitis subcordata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy environments. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Bolbitis subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
