    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sangae, commonly known as the Sangai Bulbophyllum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure and vibrant, often iridescent petals. The plant produces small, pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its challenging habitat. Its flowers are typically fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
