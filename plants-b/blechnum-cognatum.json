It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive zigzag pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, serrated margins. Blechnum cognatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
