    "intro": "Bulbophyllum keekee, commonly known as the Keke'e orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming during the winter months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
