    "intro": "Bumelia obtusifolia var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish or brownish hue. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
