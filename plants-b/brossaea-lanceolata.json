    "intro": "Brossaea lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brossaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense spikes during the spring and early summer. Brossaea lanceolata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
