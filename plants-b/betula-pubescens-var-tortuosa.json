    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. tortuosa, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive twisted, gnarled branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing habitat for various insects and birds. This resilient species is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in boreal and alpine environments."
