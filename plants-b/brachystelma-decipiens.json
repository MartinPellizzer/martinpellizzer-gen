    "intro": "Brachystelma decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive stone orchid, is a member of the Aphyllanthe genus within the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pale green or brown flowers that are often camouflaged to resemble stones or lichens, a characteristic that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Brachystelma decipiens is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions of Namibia and South Africa."
