    "intro": "Brachycorythis leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is pollinated by specific insects, making it ecologically significant. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
