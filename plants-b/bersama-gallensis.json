    "intro": "Bersama gallensis, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has a unique root system that includes pneumatophores, specialized structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or green, and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects."
