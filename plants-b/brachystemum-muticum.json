    "intro": "Brachystemum muticum, commonly known as the common sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that can vary in color from green to brown depending on environmental conditions. This species is typically found in intertidal zones, where it attaches to rocks or other substrates. Brachystemum muticum plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce asexually make it a common and widespread species in temperate coastal areas."
