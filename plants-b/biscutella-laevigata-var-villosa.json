It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom in early spring. The species is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic habitats."
