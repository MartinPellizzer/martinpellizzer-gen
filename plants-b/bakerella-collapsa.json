    "intro": "Bakerella collapsa, commonly known as the soft-stemmed bakerella, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bakerella collapsa is known for its weak, often sprawling growth habit, which contributes to its common name."
