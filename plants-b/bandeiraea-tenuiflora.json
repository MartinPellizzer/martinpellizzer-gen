    "intro": "Bandeiraea tenuiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers and compound leaves. The plant is known for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and conservation studies."
