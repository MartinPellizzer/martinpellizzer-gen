    "intro": "Bilabrella welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia bilabrella, is a unique succulent native to the Namib Desert of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to the arid environment. The plant has a short, woody stem with two pairs of large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Bilabrella welwitschii is a living fossil, with a lineage dating back millions of years, making it a subject of scientific interest."
