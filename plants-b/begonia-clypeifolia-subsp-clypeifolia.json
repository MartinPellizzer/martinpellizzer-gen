    "intro": "Begonia clypeifolia subsp. clypeifolia, commonly known as the shield-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or oval with a distinctive shield-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. This species is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
