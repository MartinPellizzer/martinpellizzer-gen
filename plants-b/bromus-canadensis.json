    "intro": "Bromus canadensis, commonly known as Canada bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Bromus canadensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
