    "intro": "Begonia anisosepala, commonly known as the irregular-sepaled begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
