    "intro": "Bulbophyllum grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal or dry environments. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts."
