    "intro": "Banksia horrida, commonly known as the rigid banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has thick, fibrous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive texture. Its unique floral structure supports a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Banksia horrida is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat."
