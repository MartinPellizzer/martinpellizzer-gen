    "intro": "Banisteriopsis pubescens, commonly known as the \"sacred tree\" or \"ayahuasca tree,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Amazon rainforests of South America and is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for containing the alkaloid dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is used in traditional shamanic rituals. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its cultural and medicinal significance, it is often cultivated in both traditional and modern settings."
