    "intro": "Bassia eriophora var. rosea, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine, silky hairs, and the stems are typically reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry conditions."
