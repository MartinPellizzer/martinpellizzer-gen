    "intro": "Bryonia deltoidea, commonly known as the delta bryony, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and can bear yellow-orange flowers that are followed by orange-red, spiny fruits. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It contains toxic compounds, particularly in its roots and stems, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal historical use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
