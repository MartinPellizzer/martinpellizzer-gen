    "intro": "Bromus inopinatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a species of grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Bromus inopinatus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
