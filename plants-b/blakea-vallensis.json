    "intro": "Blakea vallensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its evergreen nature and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Blakea vallensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
