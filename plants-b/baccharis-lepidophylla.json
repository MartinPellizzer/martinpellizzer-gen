    "intro": "Baccharis lepidophylla, commonly known as the fairy duster, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white, feathery inflorescences that resemble miniature dusters, which are particularly striking when in bloom. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Baccharis lepidophylla is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually appealing plant in xeriscapes."
