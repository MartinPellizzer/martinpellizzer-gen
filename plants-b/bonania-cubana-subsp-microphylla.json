    "intro": "Bonania cubana subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the Cuban bonania, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, specifically Cuba. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
