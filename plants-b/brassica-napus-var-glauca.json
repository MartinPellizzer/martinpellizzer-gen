    "intro": "Brassica napus var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous rape, is a variety of rapeseed characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray waxy coating on the leaves and stems. This coating, known as glaucous, provides a natural resistance to certain pests and environmental stressors. It is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces yellow flowers and long, slender pods containing seeds used in oil production. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental and an agricultural species."
