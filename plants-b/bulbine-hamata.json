    "intro": "Bulbine hamata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
