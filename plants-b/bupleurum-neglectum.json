    "intro": "Bupleurum neglectum, commonly known as wild celery or goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its small white or yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Bupleurum neglectum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
