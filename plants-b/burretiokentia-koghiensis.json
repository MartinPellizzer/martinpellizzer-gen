    "intro": "Burretiokentia koghiensis, commonly known as the Koghi palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feather-like leaves that are typically clustered at the top. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by dark blue, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the coconut. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Burretiokentia koghiensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
