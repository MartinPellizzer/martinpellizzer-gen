    "intro": "Betula karagandensis, commonly known as the Karaganda birch, is a species of birch native to Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cold, mountainous regions. The plant has slender, white-barked trunks and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds. Betula karagandensis is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
