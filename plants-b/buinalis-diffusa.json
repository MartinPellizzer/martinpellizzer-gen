    "intro": "Buinalis diffusa, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Buinalis diffusa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
