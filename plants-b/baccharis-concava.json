    "intro": "Baccharis concava, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as swamps and marshes, and is often found along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated margins, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis concava plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
