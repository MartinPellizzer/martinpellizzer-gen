It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white or cream flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
