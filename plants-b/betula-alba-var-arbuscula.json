    "intro": "Betula alba var. arbuscula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and white when young, developing into a flaky, greyish texture as the tree matures. Its small, triangular leaves turn yellow in autumn, and it produces catkins that release wind-pollinated seeds. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks."
