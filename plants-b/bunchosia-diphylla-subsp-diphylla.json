    "intro": "Bunchosia diphylla subsp. diphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or false rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used traditionally in some regions for its wood. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
