    "intro": "Blechnum hillii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its fronds are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
