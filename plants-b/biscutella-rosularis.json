    "intro": "Biscutella rosularis, commonly known as the rose-like biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, giving it its common name. The plant has a distinctive rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun. Biscutella rosularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
