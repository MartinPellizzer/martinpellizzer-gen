It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in decorative arrangements. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are consumed by both humans and wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The areca palm is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
