    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vestitum var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The unique appearance and fragrance of this orchid make it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
