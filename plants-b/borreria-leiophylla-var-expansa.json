    "intro": "Borreria leiophylla var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf borreria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
