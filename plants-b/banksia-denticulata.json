    "intro": "Banksia denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Banksia denticulata is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for various pollinators."
