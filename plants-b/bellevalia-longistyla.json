    "intro": "Bellevalia longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with long, slender stamens that extend beyond the petals. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Bellevalia longistyla is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in well-drained, sunny environments."
