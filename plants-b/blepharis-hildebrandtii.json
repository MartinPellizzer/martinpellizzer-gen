    "intro": "Blepharis hildebrandtii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
