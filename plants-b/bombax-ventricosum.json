    "intro": "Bombax ventricosum, commonly known as the African silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its fibers, which have traditional uses in various cultures."
