    "intro": "Bryobium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its soft, fuzzy appearance due to the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are closely arranged and often have a smooth or slightly undulating surface. Bryobium lanuginosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
