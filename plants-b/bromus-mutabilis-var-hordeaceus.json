    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis var. hordeaceus, commonly known as the jointed goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and culms that are often jointed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with leathery, awned glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can become a weed."
