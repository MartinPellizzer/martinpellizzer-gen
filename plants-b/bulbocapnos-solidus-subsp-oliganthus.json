    "intro": "Bulbocapnos solidus subsp. oliganthus, commonly known as the rare alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, hairy leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to the harsh, cold climates of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
