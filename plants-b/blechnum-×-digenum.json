    "intro": "Blechnum \u00d7 digenum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Blechnum capillus-veneris and Blechnum penna-marina. It is a low-growing evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arching or cascading. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green with a glossy surface and may have a slightly serrated margin. Blechnum \u00d7 digenum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
