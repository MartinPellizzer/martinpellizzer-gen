It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland habitats. Banksia prolata subsp. prolata is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for native wildlife."
