    "intro": "Bulbophyllum novaciae, commonly known as the Novacaea orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with irregular rainfall. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is often grown as a terrestrial or epiphytic plant in shaded, humid conditions."
