    "intro": "Bulbophyllum planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flat, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
