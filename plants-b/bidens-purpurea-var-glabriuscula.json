    "intro": "Bidens purpurea var. glabriuscula, commonly known as purple beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It features slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with prominent white markings, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are encased in bracts that adhere to clothing or animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks."
