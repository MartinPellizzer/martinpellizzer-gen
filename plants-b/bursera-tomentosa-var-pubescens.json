    "intro": "Bursera tomentosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the silky bursera, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
