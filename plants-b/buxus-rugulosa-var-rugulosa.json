    "intro": "Buxus rugulosa var. rugulosa, commonly known as the common boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval leaves that have a slight rugose texture. The plant typically grows in compact, rounded forms and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Due to its hardiness and ease of maintenance, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
