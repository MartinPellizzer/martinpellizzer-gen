    "intro": "Banksia petrophila, commonly known as the granite banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils, particularly on granite outcrops, and is adapted to the dry, harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Banksia petrophila plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species."
