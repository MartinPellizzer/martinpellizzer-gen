    "intro": "Bulbostylis scandens, commonly known as the climbing bulbostylis, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. The species is notable for its climbing habit, as it often uses its stems to ascend through vegetation or structures."
