    "intro": "Bulbophyllum congestiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
