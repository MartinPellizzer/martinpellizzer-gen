    "intro": "Bryantia viscida, commonly known as the sticky bryantia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Bryantia viscida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
