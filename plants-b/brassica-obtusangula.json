    "intro": "Brassica obtusangula, commonly known as the woolly mustard, is a flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces elongated pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
