    "intro": "Blechnum arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizome that serves as a storage organ and supports the growth of the trunk. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, displaying a striking blue-green hue under certain light conditions. This unique botanical feature makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of scientific study."
