    "intro": "Buxus wallichiana var. velutina, commonly known as velvet boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, dark green foliage that is slightly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy appearance and remain throughout the year. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in hedges and topiary due to its slow growth and hardiness."
