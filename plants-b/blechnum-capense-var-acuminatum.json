    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
