    "intro": "Blechnum valdiviense var. contigua, commonly known as the Valdivian holly fern, is a fern species native to South America, particularly found in the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
