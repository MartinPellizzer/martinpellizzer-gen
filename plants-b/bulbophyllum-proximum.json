    "intro": "Bulbophyllum proximum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's striking white flowers resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
