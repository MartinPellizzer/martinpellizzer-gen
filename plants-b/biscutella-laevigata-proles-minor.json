It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense mat near the soil surface. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe."
