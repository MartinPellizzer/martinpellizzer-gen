    "intro": "Bolbitis appendiculata var. kummatta, commonly known as the Kummatta fern, is a variant of the Bolbitis genus native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often display a light green to pale yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. The fronds are pinnately compound, with finely divided, silky-textured leaflets that give the plant a soft, elegant appearance."
