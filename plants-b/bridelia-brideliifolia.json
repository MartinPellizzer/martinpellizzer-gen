    "intro": "Bridelia brideliifolia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Bridelia brideliifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
