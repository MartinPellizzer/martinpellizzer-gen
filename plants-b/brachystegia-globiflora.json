    "intro": "Brachystegia globiflora, commonly known as the African teak or globiflora brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has also been historically valued for timber use."
