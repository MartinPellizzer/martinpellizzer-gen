    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gibbosum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments on rock surfaces or in forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Bulbophyllum gibbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
