It features small, dense, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a topiary plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping."
