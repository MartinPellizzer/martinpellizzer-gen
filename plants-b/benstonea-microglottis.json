    "intro": "Benstonea microglottis, commonly known as the slender leaf benstonea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
