    "intro": "Berberis andreana, commonly known as the Andean barberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural applications."
