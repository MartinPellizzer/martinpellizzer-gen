    "intro": "Breynia gynophora, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Breynia gynophora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil stabilization and ecological restoration efforts."
