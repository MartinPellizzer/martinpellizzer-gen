    "intro": "Bromopsis riparia subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist soils. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-green color, while the flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
