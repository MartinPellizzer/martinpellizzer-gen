    "intro": "Breynia lanceolata, commonly known as the fire tree, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. Breynia lanceolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
