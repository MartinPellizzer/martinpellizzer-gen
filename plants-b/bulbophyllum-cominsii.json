    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cominsii, commonly known as the Comins' orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
