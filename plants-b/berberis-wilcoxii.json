    "intro": "Berberis wilcoxii, commonly known as the Wilcox barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features spiny branches and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often avoided by wildlife due to their bitter taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
