    "intro": "Brachyotum trichocalyx, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
