    "intro": "Bulbophyllum zaratananae subsp. zaratananae, commonly known as the Zaratananae Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which can be brightly colored, are typically borne on elongated stems and attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
