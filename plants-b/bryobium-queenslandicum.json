    "intro": "Bryobium queenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland bryobium, is a unique and rare plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Dendrobieae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often colorful inflorescences. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. Its botanical features include showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
