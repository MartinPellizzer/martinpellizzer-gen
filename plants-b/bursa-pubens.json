    "intro": "Bursa pubens, commonly known as the pubescent burr, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed burr that becomes rough and prickly when mature, aiding in seed dispersal. Bursa pubens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
