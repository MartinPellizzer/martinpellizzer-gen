    "intro": "Bossiaea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in spring, and its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. It is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many plants with specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. Bossiaea stenophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
