    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys, commonly known as the tall brome or large-stemmed brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, disturbed soils, and open woodlands. Bromus macrostachys is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
