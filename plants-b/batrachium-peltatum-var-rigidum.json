    "intro": "Batrachium peltatum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are rigid and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds."
