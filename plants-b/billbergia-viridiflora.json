    "intro": "Billbergia viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant green flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the central stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
