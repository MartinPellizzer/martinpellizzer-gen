    "intro": "Bromus mucronatus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Bromus mucronatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
