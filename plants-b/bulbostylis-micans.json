    "intro": "Bulbostylis micans, commonly known as the glittering bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
