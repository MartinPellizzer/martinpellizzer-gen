    "intro": "Briza deltoidea, commonly known as delta beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, drooping inflorescences and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as streambanks and wet meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Briza deltoidea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
