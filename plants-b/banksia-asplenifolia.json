    "intro": "Banksia asplenifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its woody fruiting structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Banksia asplenifolia is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
