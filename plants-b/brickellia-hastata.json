    "intro": "Brickellia hastata, commonly known as narrowleaf brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Brickellia hastata is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
