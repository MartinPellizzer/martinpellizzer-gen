    "intro": "Blepharis dunensis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Blepharis dunensis is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
