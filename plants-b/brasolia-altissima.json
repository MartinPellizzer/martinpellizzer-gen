    "intro": "Brasolia altissima, commonly known as the skyward lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach heights of up to 15 feet, supporting large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Brasolia altissima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
