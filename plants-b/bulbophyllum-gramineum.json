    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gramineum, commonly known as the grass-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leaf-like appearance, which resembles grass, and its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and delicate nature, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
