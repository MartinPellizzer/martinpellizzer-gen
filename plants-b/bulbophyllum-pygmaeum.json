    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pygmaeum, commonly known as the pygmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers, often white or pale yellow, are typically clustered in racemes. Bulbophyllum pygmaeum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
