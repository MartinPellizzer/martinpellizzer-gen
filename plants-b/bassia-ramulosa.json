    "intro": "Bassia ramulosa, commonly known as sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
