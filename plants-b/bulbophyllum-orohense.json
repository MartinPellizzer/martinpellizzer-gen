    "intro": "Bulbophyllum orohense, commonly known as the Sierra Leone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to West Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
