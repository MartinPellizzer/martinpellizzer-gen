    "intro": "Bousigonia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bousigonia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
