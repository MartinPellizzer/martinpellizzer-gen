    "intro": "Braya falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Braya falcata is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access moisture."
