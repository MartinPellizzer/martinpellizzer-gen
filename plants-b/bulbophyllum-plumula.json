    "intro": "Bulbophyllum plumula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that help in pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
