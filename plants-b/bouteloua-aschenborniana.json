    "intro": "Bouteloua aschenborniana, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, cylindrical seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
