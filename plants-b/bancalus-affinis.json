    "intro": "Bancalus affinis, commonly known as the black-lipped beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Dynastes, which includes various large, colorful beetles. It is characterized by its robust body, typically black in color with a metallic sheen, and distinctive features such as the prominent horn on the head. The plant aspect of Bancalus affinis is not applicable, as it is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
