    "intro": "Begonia leandrii, commonly known as the Leandrii begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant variegation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
