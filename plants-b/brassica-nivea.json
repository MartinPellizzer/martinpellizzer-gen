It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Brassica nivea is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil health."
