    "intro": "Bidens cooperi, commonly known as the yellow beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with white markings and hairy stems. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Bidens cooperi is often considered a weed but has ecological value by providing food for pollinators."
