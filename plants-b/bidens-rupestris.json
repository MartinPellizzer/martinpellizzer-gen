    "intro": "Bidens rupestris, commonly known as the rock ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens rupestris is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
