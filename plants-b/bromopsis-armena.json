    "intro": "Bromopsis armena, commonly known as Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromopsis armena thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
