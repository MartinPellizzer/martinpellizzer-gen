    "intro": "Begonia sylvatica, commonly known as the forest begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for ground cover in woodland gardens. Begonia sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
