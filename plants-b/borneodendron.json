    "intro": "Borneodendron, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Borneodendron thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
