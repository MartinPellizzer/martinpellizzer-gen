    "intro": "Brucea erythraeae, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Brucea erythraeae is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
