    "intro": "Bignonia cuneifolia, commonly known as the climbing flame vine, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces vibrant orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its fast growth rate and ability to climb using its tendrils, making it suitable for trellises or fences. Its botanical name reflects its leaf shape (\"cuneifolia\" meaning wedge-shaped leaf), and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
