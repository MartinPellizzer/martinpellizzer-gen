    "intro": "Betula alba var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The bark is smooth and pale, often with a white or yellowish hue, and it exudes a resin when cut. It thrives in harsh environments such as mountainous regions and coastal areas, tolerating poor soil and cold climates. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
