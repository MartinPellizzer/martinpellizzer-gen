    "intro": "Bunium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family, and its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits. Bunium microcarpum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
