    "intro": "Bletia jongheana, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it store moisture in its natural habitat. Bletia jongheana is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows in soil rather than on other plants. Its blooming period typically occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular subject in botanical gardens."
