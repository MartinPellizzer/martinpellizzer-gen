    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or purple markings. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storage of water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
