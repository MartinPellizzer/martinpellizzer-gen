    "intro": "Balessam, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though they contain toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care. Balessam species are typically shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often aromatic bark."
