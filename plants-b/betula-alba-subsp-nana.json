    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often twisted branches. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, while the bark is white and smooth in young plants. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and mountainous regions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh climates and its role in stabilizing soil in Arctic and alpine environments."
