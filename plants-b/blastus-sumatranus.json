    "intro": "Blastus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran blastus, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to pineapples. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
