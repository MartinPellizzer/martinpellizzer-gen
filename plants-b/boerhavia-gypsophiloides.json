It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions."
