    "intro": "Bulbophyllum graveolens, commonly known as the smelly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that emit a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Bulbophyllum graveolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent."
