    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scopula, commonly known as the spored bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Bulbophyllum scopula thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
