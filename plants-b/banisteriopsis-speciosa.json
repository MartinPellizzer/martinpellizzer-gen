    "intro": "Banisteriopsis speciosa, commonly known as the sacred yew or Ayahuasca vine, is a woody climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant is known for containing the psychoactive alkaloid DMT, which plays a significant role in traditional shamanic practices. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with ample shade and nutrient-rich soil. Its botanical significance extends beyond its chemical composition to its cultural and ecological importance in the Amazon."
