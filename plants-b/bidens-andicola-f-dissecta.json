    "intro": "Bidens andicola f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role."
