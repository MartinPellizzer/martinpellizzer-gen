It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, pale yellow to white ray florets. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous disk flowers in the center of the bloom.
