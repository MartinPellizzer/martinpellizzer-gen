It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive disc-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
