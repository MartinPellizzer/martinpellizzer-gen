    "intro": "Bletia wageneri, commonly known as the waxlip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the dappled light. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which are often pink or purple, are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
