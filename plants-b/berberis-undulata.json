    "intro": "Berberis undulata, commonly known as the zigzag barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often contorted and undulating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture. Berberis undulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
