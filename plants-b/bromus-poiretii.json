    "intro": "Bromus poiretii, commonly known as Poiret's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Bromus poiretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
