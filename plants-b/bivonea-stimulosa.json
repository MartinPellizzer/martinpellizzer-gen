    "intro": "Bivonea stimulosa, commonly known as the spurred orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique spurred petals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with a complex structure that facilitates specialized pollination mechanisms. Bivonea stimulosa is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
