    "intro": "Betula jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in mountainous regions and boreal forests."
