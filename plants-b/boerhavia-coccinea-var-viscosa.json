    "intro": "Boerhavia coccinea var. viscosa, commonly known as crimson sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy red flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
