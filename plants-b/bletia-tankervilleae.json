    "intro": "Bletia tankervilleae, commonly known as the tankerville orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which appear during the wet season. Bletia tankervilleae thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings and as a potted plant."
