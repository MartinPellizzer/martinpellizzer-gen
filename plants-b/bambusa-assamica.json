    "intro": "Bambusa assamica, commonly known as the Assam bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its sturdy, slender culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Bambusa assamica is valued for its use in construction, crafts, and as a source of bamboo shoots."
