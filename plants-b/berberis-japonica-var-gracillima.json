It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries in the fall. It has thorny stems and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
