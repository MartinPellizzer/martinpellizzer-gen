It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with upright stems and broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bia fallax is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
