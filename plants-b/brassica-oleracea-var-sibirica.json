    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian kale, is a hardy, cold-tolerant plant native to Central Asia. It is a biennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with thick, spoon-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by round, dark green pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are rich in nutrients and are often used in traditional cuisines for their mild, slightly bitter flavor. The plant is well adapted to harsh climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
