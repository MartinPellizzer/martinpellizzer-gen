    "intro": "Bathysa meridionalis, commonly known as the southern bathysa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in wetland environments. Bathysa meridionalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
