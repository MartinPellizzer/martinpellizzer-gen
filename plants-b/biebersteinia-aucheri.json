    "intro": "Biebersteinia aucheri, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Biebersteinia aucheri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
