    "intro": "Bulbophyllum linzhiense, commonly known as the Linzhi orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
