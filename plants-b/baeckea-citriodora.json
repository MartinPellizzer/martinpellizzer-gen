    "intro": "Baeckea citriodora, commonly known as lemon myrtle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are often used in culinary and aromatic applications due to their unique flavor and essential oil content. Baeckea citriodora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
