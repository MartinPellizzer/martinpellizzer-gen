    "intro": "Begonia circumlobata, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins that contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and delicate floral display."
