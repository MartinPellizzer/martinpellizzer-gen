It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms a dense network of rhizomes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and the flowers are clustered in a spike with a distinctive, elongated shape. Bletia warnockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
