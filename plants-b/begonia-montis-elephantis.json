    "intro": "Begonia montis-elephantis, commonly known as the Mount Elephant Begonia, is a rare and unique species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a range of colors, from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern."
