It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula \u00d7 aschersoniana is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
