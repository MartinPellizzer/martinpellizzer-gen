    "intro": "Brachypodium durum, commonly known as hardstem bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium durum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its ecological significance includes serving as a forage plant for livestock and a model organism in plant biology research."
