    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus subsp. parvispiculatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the flowers are arranged in dense, compact clusters. This subspecies is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
