    "intro": "Banksia sphaerocarpa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped yellow flower spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is part of the Proteaceae family and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for various pollinators."
