    "intro": "Bassia cristata, commonly known as crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finger-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Bassia cristata is often used in erosion control and forage production due to its hardy nature."
