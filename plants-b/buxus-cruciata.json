    "intro": "Buxus cruciata, commonly known as the crossbush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a cross-like pattern on the stems. The plant produces tiny, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Buxus cruciata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal contribute to its use in horticultural settings."
