It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant features a tall, slender trunk with smooth, gray bark and dense foliage of lance-shaped leaves. Boliviadendron produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
