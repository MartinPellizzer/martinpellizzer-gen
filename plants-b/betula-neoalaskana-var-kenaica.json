    "intro": "Betula neoalaskana var. kenaica, commonly known as the Kenaica birch, is a rare and endemic species native to Alaska. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in boreal forest environments. It produces small, cone-like fruiting structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
