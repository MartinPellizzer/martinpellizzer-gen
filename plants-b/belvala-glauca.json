    "intro": "Belvala glauca, commonly known as the blue glaucous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray underside, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Belvala glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
