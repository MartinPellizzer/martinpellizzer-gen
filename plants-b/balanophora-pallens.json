    "intro": "Balanophora pallens, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant has a short, thick stem with fleshy leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments. Balanophora pallens plays a unique ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
