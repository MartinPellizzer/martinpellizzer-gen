    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. alsatica, commonly known as the Alsatic biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming growth habit and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its capsule fruits contain several small, elliptical seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
