    "intro": "Bothriochloa wrightii, commonly known as Wright's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Wright's bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
