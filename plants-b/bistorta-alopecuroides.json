    "intro": "Bistorta alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a thick, rhizomatous rootstock and upright, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Bistorta alopecuroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
