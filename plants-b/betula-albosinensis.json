It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges. Betula albosinensis is often found in moist, temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
