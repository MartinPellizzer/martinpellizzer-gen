    "intro": "Bergia pedicellaris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline environments and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Bergia pedicellaris produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its unique morphology makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
