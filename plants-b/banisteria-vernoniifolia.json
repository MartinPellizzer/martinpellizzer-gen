    "intro": "Banisteria vernoniifolia, commonly known as the vernon's leaf banisteria, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread along supports. Banisteria vernoniifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
