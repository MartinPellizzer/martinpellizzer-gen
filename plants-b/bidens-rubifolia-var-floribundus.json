It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and serrated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many areas."
