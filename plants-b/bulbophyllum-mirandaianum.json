    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mirandaianum, commonly known as the Miranda Island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Miranda in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
