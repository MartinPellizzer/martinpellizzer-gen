    "intro": "Bolbitis aliena, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated rhizomes that can grow up to several meters in length, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance, often resembling those of other fern genera. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Bolbitis aliena thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
