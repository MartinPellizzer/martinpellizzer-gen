    "intro": "Baccharis laevis, commonly known as smooth baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-green, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flower clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Smooth baccharis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in sandy or coastal environments."
