    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. intonsus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy margins, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread in suitable environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
