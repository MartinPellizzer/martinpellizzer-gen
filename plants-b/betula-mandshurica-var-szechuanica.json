    "intro": "Betula mandshurica var. szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age, and its slender, upright branches. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with doubly serrated margins, and they turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
