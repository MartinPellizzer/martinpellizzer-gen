    "intro": "Bassovia stramoniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
