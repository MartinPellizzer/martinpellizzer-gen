    "intro": "Bromus mollis subsp. thominei, commonly known as Thomine's brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its flowering stalks. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
