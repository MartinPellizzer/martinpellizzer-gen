    "intro": "Bulbophyllum quadrialatum, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
