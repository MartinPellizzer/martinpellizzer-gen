It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by spherical, three-lobed pods containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Field mustard is notable for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated crops."
