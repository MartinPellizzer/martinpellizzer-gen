    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. subrosea, commonly known as the red beet or table beet, is a biennial plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that are typically red or purple in color, though the subrosea variant exhibits a lighter, more rose-like hue. The plant also features large, palmate leaves that are edible and often used in salads or cooked dishes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is cultivated for both its roots and leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as iron and fiber."
