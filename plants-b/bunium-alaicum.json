    "intro": "Bunium alaicum, commonly known as the alpine fennel, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, umbelliferous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, spicy fragrance, while its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Due to its habitat, Bunium alaicum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
