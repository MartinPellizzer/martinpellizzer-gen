It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Barbosella anaristella is often found growing along rocky slopes and in sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
