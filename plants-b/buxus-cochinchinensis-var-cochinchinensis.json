    "intro": "Buxus cochinchinensis var. cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into topiaries. This variety is often used in landscape design for its ornamental value and resilience in shaded conditions."
