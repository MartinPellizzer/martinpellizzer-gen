    "intro": "Blitum glandulosum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf size and efficient water use."
