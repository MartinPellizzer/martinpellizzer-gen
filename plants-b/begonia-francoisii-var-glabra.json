    "intro": "Begonia francoisii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
