    "intro": "Bromus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Bromus nepalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
