The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in agricultural settings. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is an annual or biennial plant that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, facilitating its spread in various environments."
