It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
