    "intro": "Batrachium baudotii subsp. leontinensis, commonly known as the Leontinensis Batrachium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a basal rosette of leaves, which contribute to its unique ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
