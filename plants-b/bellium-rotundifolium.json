    "intro": "Bellium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
