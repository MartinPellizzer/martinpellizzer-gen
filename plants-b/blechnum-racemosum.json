    "intro": "Blechnum racemosum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they can grow quite large, sometimes reaching lengths of over two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
