    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fossatum, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence that bears clusters of pale yellow to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphytic species that does not rely on soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
