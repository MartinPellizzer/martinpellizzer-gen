    "intro": "Berberis integerrima var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
