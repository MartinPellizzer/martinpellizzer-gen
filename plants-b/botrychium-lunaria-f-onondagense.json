    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria f. onondagense, commonly known as the Onondaga moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, moon-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, spore-bearing sporangia clustered in a rosette-like arrangement. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
