    "intro": "Baeothryon retroflexum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Baeothryon retroflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
