It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
