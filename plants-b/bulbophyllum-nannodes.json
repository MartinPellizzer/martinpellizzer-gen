    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nannodes, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
