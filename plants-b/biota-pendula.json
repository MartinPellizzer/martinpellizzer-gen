    "intro": "Biota pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a light green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. This species thrives in moist environments and is often found near water sources."
