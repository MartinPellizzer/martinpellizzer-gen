    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus var. hispidus, commonly known as the hispid brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has a tufted growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that distinguishes it from other bromes. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
