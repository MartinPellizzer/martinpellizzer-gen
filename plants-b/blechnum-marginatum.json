    "intro": "Blechnum marginatum, commonly known as the marginal harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive pale margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Blechnum marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
