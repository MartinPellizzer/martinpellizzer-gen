    "intro": "Bromus nemorosus, commonly known as the wood brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus nemorosus is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
