It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, linear leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive, narrow lip that sets it apart from other orchid species.
