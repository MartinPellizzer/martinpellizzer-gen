It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a delicate, fern-like frond with a central axis and small, clustered sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are arranged in a composite-like pattern, giving it its common name. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive botanical features."
