    "intro": "Bromus segetalis var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multiflorous barnyard grass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it can become a weed in cultivated areas, competing with crops for resources."
