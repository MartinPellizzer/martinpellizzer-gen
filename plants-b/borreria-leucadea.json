    "intro": "Borreria leucadea, commonly known as white borreria, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Borreria leucadea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
