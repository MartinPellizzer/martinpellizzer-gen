It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with soft, silky hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
