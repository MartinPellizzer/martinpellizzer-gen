    "intro": "Banksia brevidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces yellow flowers that are rich in nectar, attracting a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. Its woody seed pods, known as follicles, release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation. Banksia brevidentata is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
