    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. typicus, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color. It is an important forage plant for livestock and can also act as an indicator species for soil disturbance."
