    "intro": "Bunium fedtschenkoanum, commonly known as the Siberian fennel, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like parsley and dill. The plant features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of fennel. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The seeds are small and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which aids in their dispersal by wind."
