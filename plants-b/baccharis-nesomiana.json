    "intro": "Baccharis nesomiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. It is drought-tolerant and has a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
