    "intro": "Botrychium boreale subsp. obtusilobum, commonly known as the northern moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, moon-shaped sporangia that are clustered in a single umbel on the underside of its fertile leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile fronds resembling broad, lance-shaped blades and fertile fronds that are more compact. This subspecies is native to northern regions of North America and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora."
