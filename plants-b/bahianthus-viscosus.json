    "intro": "Bahianthus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky bush, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a thick, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Bahianthus viscosus is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
