    "intro": "Bunias paradoxa, commonly known as the giant winter cress, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its seeds are encased in a spongy, fleshy fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Bunias paradoxa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
