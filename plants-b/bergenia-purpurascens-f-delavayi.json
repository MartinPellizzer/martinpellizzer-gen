    "intro": "Bergenia purpurascens f. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's bergenia, is a variant of the bergenia plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms a low-growing mat, often with a reddish tinge on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces."
