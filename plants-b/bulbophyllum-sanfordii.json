    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sanfordii, commonly known as the Sanford's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. The plant's unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
