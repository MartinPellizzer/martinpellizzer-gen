    "intro": "Begonia sinuata var. etamensis, commonly known as the Etamensis begonia, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its velvety, deeply lobed leaves that display a rich array of colors, often with a reddish or maroon hue. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
