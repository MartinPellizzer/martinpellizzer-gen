It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, riverbanks, and fields. Its leaves are usually hairy, especially along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
