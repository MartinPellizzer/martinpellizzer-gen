    "intro": "Brassica campestris f. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous cabbage, is a variant of the turnip or field mustard. It is characterized by its bluish-gray waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it a distinct appearance. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves and roots, though it is less common than other brassica species."
