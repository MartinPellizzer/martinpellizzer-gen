    "intro": "Brachiaria subquadripara var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its dense growth, it is used for forage and erosion control in certain regions."
