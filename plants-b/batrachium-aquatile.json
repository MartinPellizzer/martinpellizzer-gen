    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile, commonly known as the water frog plant, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom above the water. Its root system helps stabilize sediment in aquatic environments. It is often used in water gardens and for biological filtration in ponds."
