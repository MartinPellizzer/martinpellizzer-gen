    "intro": "Bletia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive hood-like lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps. Bletia cucullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
