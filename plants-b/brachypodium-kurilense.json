    "intro": "Brachypodium kurilense, commonly known as Kuril false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium kurilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
