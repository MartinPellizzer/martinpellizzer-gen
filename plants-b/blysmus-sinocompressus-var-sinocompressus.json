It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically grass-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
