    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. subarctica, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small, shrub-like tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and hairy, grayish-brown bark. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, while the small, cone-like fruits are dispersed by wind. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in taiga and tundra environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native habitat."
