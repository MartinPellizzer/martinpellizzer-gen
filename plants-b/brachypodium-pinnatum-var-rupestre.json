    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. rupestre, commonly known as the rock bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a pioneer species in ecological restoration projects."
