It features distinctive orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine, hairy pubescence, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.
