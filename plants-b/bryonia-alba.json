    "intro": "Bryonia alba, commonly known as white bryony, is a toxic flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its hairy, trailing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange berries, which contain toxic compounds such as bryonin. Its roots are also toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its harmful effects. Bryonia alba thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows and along roadsides."
