It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, pale yellow flowers. Baumea crassa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest margins and along stream banks."
