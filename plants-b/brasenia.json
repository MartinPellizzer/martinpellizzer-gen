    "intro": "Brasenia, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Brasenia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and helping to stabilize water quality."
