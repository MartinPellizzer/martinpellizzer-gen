    "intro": "Bidens grandis, commonly known as the great ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Bidens grandis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
