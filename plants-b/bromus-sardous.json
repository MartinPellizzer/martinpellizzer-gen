    "intro": "Bromus sardous, commonly known as the Sardinian brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Bromus sardous is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands."
