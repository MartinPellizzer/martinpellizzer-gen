    "intro": "Bauhinia columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia bauhinia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wooded areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small, feathery segments. Bauhinia columbiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
