    "intro": "Bauhinia furcata, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble a crown, and its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia furcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
