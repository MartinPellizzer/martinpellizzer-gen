    "intro": "Blastocaulon rupestre, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure is a composite of fungal hyphae and algal cells, forming a crust-like growth that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological health."
