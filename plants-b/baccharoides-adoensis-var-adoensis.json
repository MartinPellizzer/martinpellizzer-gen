    "intro": "Baccharoides adoensis var. adoensis, commonly known as the Adoensis baccharoid, is a shrub native to specific regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
