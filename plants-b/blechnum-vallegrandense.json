    "intro": "Blechnum vallegrandense, commonly known as the valley grand fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
