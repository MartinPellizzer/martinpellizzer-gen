    "intro": "Begonia chlorolepis, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
