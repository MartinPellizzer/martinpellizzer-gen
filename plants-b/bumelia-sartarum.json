    "intro": "Bumelia sartarum, commonly known as the Mexican sycamore, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin layers, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
