    "intro": "Bactris mollis, commonly known as the pink palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-red stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is small and edible, though not as widely consumed as other palm fruits. Bactris mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
