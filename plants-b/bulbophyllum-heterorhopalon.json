    "intro": "Bulbophyllum heterorhopalon, commonly known as the variable lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are often marked with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and sometimes arid environments. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral displays."
