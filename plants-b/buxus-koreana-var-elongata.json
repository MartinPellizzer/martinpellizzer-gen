    "intro": "Buxus koreana var. elongata, commonly known as the Korean boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Korea. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated compared to the typical boxwood species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
