    "intro": "Bromus racemifer, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Bromus racemifer is often found in areas with low precipitation and is adapted to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
