    "intro": "Burmannia malasica, commonly known as the Malacca burmannia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking, often red or orange-colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with separate male and female parts, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Burmannia malasica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bracts and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
