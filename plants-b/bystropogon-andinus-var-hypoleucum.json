    "intro": "Bystropogon andinus var. hypoleucum, commonly known as the Andean white yew, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are glaucous in appearance, providing a distinctive silver-blue hue. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
