It is characterized by its small, fragrant white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or rainforest habitats. This variety is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a soft, hairy appearance."
