It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slight pubescence. Barleria pyramidalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and drought tolerance."
