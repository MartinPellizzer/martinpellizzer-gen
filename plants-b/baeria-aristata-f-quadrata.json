    "intro": "Baeria aristata f. quadrata, commonly known as the quadrata form of the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous environment. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
