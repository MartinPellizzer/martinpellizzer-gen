    "intro": "Bromus ambiguus, commonly known as the common brome, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-based inflorescence, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. Bromus ambiguus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
