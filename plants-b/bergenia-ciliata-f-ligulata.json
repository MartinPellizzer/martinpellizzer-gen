    "intro": "Bergenia ciliata f. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bergenia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, sturdy stems. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing ornamental value in both garden and natural settings. Bergenia ciliata f. ligulata is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils and is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
