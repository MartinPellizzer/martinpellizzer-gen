    "intro": "Bellis pilosa, commonly known as the Shaggy Mary or Woolly Daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and gardens. Bellis pilosa is also known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that can help suppress weeds."
