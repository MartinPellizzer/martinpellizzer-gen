It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
