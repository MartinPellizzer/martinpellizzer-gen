    "intro": "Berberis rigidifolia var. globosa, commonly known as the globular barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit, with thick, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. Its foliage consists of leathery, dark green leaves that remain throughout the growing season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and hardy nature."
