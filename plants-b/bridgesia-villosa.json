    "intro": "Bridgesia villosa, commonly known as the woolly bridgesia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Bridgesia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
