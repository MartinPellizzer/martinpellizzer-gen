It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils in full sun."
