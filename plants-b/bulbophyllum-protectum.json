    "intro": "Bulbophyllum protectum, commonly known as the shield orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often colorful flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periodic droughts. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters and can vary in color from yellow to orange and red. This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
