    "intro": "Begonia humilis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and waxy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
