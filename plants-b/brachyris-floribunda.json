It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically has succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh, dry environment. It produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
