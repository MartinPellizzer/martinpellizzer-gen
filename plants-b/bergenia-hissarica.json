    "intro": "Bergenia hissarica, commonly known as the Caucasian bergenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Bergenia hissarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
