    "intro": "Balanophora kuroiwai, commonly known as the Kuroiwa's orchid, is a rare parasitic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted for parasitic growth. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
