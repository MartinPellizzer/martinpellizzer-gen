    "intro": "Begonia aketajawensis, commonly known as the Aketajaw begonia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glossy coating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
