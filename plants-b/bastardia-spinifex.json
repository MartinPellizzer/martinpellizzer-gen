    "intro": "Bastardia spinifex, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Its flowers are tiny, pinkish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Bastardia spinifex is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
