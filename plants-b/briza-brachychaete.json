    "intro": "Briza brachychaete, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goat's beard, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, drooping inflorescences that resemble a beard. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, greenish-white flowers. Briza brachychaete is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shady conditions."
