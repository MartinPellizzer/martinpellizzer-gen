It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
