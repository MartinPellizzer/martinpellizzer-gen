    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pachyanthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent green leaves and striking, showy flowers that are often white or pale pink. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its stems and leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
