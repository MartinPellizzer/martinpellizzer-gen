    "intro": "Bromus, commonly known as brome grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their tufted growth habit and spikelet-based inflorescences. Many species of Bromus are annual or perennial herbs, often growing in a variety of habitats including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They play an important role in soil stabilization and are sometimes used in forage or erosion control. Some species are considered weeds in agricultural settings due to their rapid growth and adaptability."
