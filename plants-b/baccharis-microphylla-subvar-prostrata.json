    "intro": "Baccharis microphylla subvar. prostrata, commonly known as creeping baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments. Its prostrate growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and ground cover in arid landscapes."
