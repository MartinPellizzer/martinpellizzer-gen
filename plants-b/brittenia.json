    "intro": "Brittenia, commonly known as the brittlebark tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, thin, and often flaky bark. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and can be either entire or lobed, depending on the species. Brittenia species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in complex inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
