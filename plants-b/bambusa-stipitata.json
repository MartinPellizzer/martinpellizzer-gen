    "intro": "Bambusa stipitata, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, ornamental bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that grow in dense clusters, making it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces small, white flowers that appear in summer, followed by tiny, red berries. Its slow growth rate and evergreen foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping and bonsai. Bambusa stipitata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
