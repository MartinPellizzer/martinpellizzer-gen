    "intro": "Baccharis humilis, commonly known as brittle bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The leaves are aromatic and can be used in traditional herbal remedies."
