    "intro": "Baccharis perlata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping. Baccharis perlata is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in arid environments."
