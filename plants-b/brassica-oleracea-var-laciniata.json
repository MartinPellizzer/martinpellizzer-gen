    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. laciniata, commonly known as ornamental kale, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its colorful, cabbage-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often ruffled or lobed. Its leaves come in a variety of colors, including purple, red, green, and white, making it a popular ornamental plant. It is a biennial plant that prefers cool climates and well-drained soil. The leaves are edible and can be used in cooking, though they are often grown for their visual appeal rather than their flavor."
