    "intro": "Bergia pentandra, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Bergia pentandra is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils near the shoreline. Its botanical features make it well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds."
