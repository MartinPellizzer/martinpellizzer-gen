    "intro": "Bistorta major var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, rhizomatous growth with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on tall, sturdy stems. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Bistorta major var. ovata thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
