    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus var. junceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spikelike flower clusters. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and the edges of lakes. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically greenish-yellow and produce small, wind-pollinated seeds. This variety is often found in temperate regions and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
