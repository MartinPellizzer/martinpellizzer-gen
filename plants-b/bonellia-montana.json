It belongs to the family Bonelliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, Bonellia montana is considered a rare and specialized species."
