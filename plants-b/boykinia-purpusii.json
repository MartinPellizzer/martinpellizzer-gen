It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
