It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
