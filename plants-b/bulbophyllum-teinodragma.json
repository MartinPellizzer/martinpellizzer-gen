    "intro": "Bulbophyllum teinodragma, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth during dry periods. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
