    "intro": "Bignonia uncata, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Bignonia uncata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
