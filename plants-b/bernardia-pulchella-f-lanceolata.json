    "intro": "Bernardia pulchella f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate bernardia, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
