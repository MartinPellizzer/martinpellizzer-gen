    "intro": "Breynia retusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvet plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to arid environments. Breynia retusa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
