    "intro": "Bromus madritensis f. persterilis, commonly known as the sterile form of the Madritense brome, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced fertility. This subspecies is typically found in specific ecological niches, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It exhibits morphological differences from the typical form, including smaller inflorescences and reduced seed production. The plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to certain regions of Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role in studying plant adaptation and reproductive strategies in marginal habitats."
