It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodlands. The plant features simple, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it its common name. Its small, fragrant flowers are white or pale yellow and appear in clusters during the spring. Bumelia buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
