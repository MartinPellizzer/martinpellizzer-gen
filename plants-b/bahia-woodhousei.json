    "intro": "Bahia woodhousei, commonly known as Woodhouse's bahia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Bahia woodhousei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in drought-prone regions. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
