    "intro": "Baltimora recta var. genuina, commonly known as the genuine straight baltimora, is a rare variant of the baltimora plant characterized by its straight, unbranched stems. It is native to specific regions with high humidity and nutrient-rich soil, typically found in tropical rainforests. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
