    "intro": "Berberis nummularia, commonly known as dwarf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded, glossy green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It is often cultivated for its compact growth and seasonal color changes. Berberis nummularia prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
