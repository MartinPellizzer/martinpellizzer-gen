    "intro": "Blechnum tabulare var. imperiale, commonly known as the imperial water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Blechnum. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance."
