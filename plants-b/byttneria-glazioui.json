It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically white or pale pink in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind."
