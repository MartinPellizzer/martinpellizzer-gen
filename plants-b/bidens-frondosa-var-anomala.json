    "intro": "Bidens frondosa var. anomala, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and roadside ditches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a serrated edge, while the flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in wetland environments."
