    "intro": "Betula obscura, commonly known as the dark birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Betula obscura thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
