    "intro": "Begonia longivillosa, commonly known as the long-hairy begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, long hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Begonia longivillosa is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
