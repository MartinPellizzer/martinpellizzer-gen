It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in lowland tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its rubber-like latex and has ecological and economic significance in its native habitat."
