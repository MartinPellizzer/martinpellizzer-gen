    "intro": "Bonafousia perrottetii, commonly known as the Perrottetii bonafousia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
