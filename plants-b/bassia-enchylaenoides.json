    "intro": "Bassia enchylaenoides, commonly known as sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
