    "intro": "Banksia fraseri var. ashbyi, commonly known as the Ashby's banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody cone-like structures that hold its characteristic yellow to orange follicles, which release seeds after fire. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
