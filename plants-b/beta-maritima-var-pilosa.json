    "intro": "Beta maritima var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sea beet, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found along shores, dunes, and rocky coastlines. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a hardy species well-suited to harsh maritime conditions."
