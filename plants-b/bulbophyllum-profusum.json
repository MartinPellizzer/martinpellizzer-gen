    "intro": "Bulbophyllum profusum, commonly known as the profuse bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Bulbophyllum profusum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
