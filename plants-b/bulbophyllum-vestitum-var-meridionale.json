    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vestitum var. meridionale, commonly known as the Southern Dressed Orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, velvety green foliage covered in a dense layer of white to pale brown trichomes, giving it a distinctive \"dressed\" appearance. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
