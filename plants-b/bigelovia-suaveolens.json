    "intro": "Bigelovia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented bigelovia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. Bigelovia suaveolens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
