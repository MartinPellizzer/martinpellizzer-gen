    "intro": "Berberis petiolaris var. grahwalana, commonly known as the Grahwalan barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India. It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest."
