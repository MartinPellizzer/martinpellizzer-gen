    "intro": "Bacopa floribunda, commonly known as the Brazilian water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Bacopa floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic environments."
