    "intro": "Beaucarnea sanctomariana, commonly known as the Santa Marianita tree, is a unique succulent native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, branched trunk covered in a layer of white, waxy bark. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
