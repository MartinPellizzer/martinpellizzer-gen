    "intro": "Begonia bequaertii, commonly known as the Congo begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep red to dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is a sought-after species among collectors and botanists."
