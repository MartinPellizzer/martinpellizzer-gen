    "intro": "Bauhinia glauca subsp. caterviflora, commonly known as the red-stemmed bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are bipinnately compound, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often reddish in color, adding visual interest to its overall appearance. Bauhinia glauca subsp. caterviflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates."
