    "intro": "Begonia richardsiana, commonly known as the Richards' begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with contrasting veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
