    "intro": "Bromopsis vulgaris, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Bromopsis vulgaris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
