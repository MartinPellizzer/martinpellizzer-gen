    "intro": "Bistorta vivipara subsp. fugax, commonly known as the creeping bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces tall, flowering stems with small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to cold climates. Its subspecific name, *fugax*, refers to its tendency to be elusive or difficult to locate in the wild."
