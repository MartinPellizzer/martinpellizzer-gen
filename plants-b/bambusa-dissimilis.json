    "intro": "Bambusa dissimilis, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a clumping bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a distinctive golden hue in its culms, which gives it its common name. The plant is relatively cold-hardy compared to other bamboo species, making it suitable for temperate climates. It grows in dense clusters and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Bambusa dissimilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to create a dense, vertical screen."
