It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. Bulbophyllum korimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
