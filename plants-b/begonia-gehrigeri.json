    "intro": "Begonia gehrigeri, commonly known as the silver queen begonia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It features attractive, waxy, silver-blue leaves with a velvety texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers on slender stems, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia gehrigeri is relatively low maintenance, making it an ideal plant for beginners and indoor gardeners."
