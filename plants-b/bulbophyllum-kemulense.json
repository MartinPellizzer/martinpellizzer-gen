    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kemulense, commonly known as the Kemulense orchid, is a species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Bulbophyllum kemulense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
