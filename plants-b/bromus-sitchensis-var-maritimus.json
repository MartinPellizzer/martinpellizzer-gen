    "intro": "Bromus sitchensis var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
