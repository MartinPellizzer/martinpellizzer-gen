    "intro": "Baeothryon subcapitatum subsp. pulogense, commonly known as the Malayan star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
