    "intro": "Bellevalia spicata, commonly known as the spiked bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky seed capsules that disperse its seeds. Bellevalia spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
