    "intro": "Bragantia tomentosa var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky bristlebush, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
