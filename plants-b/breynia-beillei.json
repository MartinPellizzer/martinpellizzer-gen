    "intro": "Breynia beillei, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating. Breynia beillei is also notable for its ability to produce a milky sap that can be toxic to some animals."
