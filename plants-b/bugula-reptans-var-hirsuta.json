    "intro": "Bugula reptans var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bugula, is a marine bryophyte belonging to the class Bryophyta. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and the presence of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. This species is typically found attached to rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, produce spores that are dispersed by water currents. The plant plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
