    "intro": "Berberis masafuerana, commonly known as the Masafuera barberry, is a shrub native to the island of Masafuera in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, glossy green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal and dry habitats, adapting well to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive plants."
