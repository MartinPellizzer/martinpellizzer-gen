    "intro": "Bromus victorinii, commonly known as the Victorin's brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus victorinii is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
