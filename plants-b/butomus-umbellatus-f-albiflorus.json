    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbed leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are arranged in an umbellate inflorescence, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to wet environments make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
