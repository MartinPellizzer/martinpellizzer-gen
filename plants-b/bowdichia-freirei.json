    "intro": "Bowdichia freirei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian sand-rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Bowdichia freirei is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
