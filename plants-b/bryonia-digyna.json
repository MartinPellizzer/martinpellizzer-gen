    "intro": "Bryonia digyna, commonly known as the Armenian bryony, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is notable for its toxic berries, which contain compounds such as bryonin and cucurbitacin, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
