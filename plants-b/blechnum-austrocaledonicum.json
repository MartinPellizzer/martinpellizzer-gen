    "intro": "Blechnum austrocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian shield fern, is a species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which may play a role in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation contributes to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
