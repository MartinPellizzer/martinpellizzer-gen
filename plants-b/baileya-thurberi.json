    "intro": "Baileya thurberi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its fruit is a small, wind-dispersed achene, typical of the Asteraceae family. Baileya thurberi is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
