The plant has simple, ovate leaves with smooth margins and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
