    "intro": "Brachyglottis southlandica var. albidula, commonly known as the silver bristlebush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas of the South Island. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
