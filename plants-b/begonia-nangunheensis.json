    "intro": "Begonia nangunheensis, commonly known as the Nangunhe begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
