    "intro": "Bromus mollissimus, commonly known as silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that are soft to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
