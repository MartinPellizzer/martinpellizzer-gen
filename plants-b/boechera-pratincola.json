    "intro": "Boechera pratincola, commonly known as the prairie rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as prairies and mountain slopes. Boechera pratincola is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh conditions."
