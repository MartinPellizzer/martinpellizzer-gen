It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
