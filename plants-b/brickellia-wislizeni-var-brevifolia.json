    "intro": "Brickellia wislizeni var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
