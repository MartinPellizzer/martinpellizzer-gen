It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of toothed leaves and a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Brachistus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in many agricultural settings. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
