    "intro": "Begonia cabanillasii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins, often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
