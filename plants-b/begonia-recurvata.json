    "intro": "Begonia recurvata, commonly known as the zigzag begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems and velvety, heart-shaped leaves that often display a deep green with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is considered endangered in the wild."
