    "intro": "Birolia palludosa, commonly known as the marsh birolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, branching stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Birolia palludosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
