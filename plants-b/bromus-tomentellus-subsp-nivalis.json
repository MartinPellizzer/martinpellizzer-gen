    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas where temperatures are low. Bromus tomentellus subsp. nivalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
