    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, often branched stems and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
