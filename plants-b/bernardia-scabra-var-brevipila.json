    "intro": "Bernardia scabra var. brevipila, commonly known as the rough-leaved bernardia, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
