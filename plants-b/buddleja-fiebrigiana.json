    "intro": "Buddleja fiebrigiana, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja fiebrigiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
