    "intro": "Baccharis prorepens, commonly known as creeping baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it both a common weed and a useful plant for erosion control."
