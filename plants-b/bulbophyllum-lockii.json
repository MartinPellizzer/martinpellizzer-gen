    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lockii, commonly known as the Lock's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers typically bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
