    "intro": "Bubania migiurtina, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Bubania migiurtina is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
