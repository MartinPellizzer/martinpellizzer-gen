    "intro": "Bugula tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy bugula, is a species of marine bryozoan found in coastal waters. It is characterized by its soft, colonial structure composed of small, calcified zooids. The colonies typically grow on submerged surfaces such as rocks and shells. Its name derives from the hairy appearance of its zooids, which are covered in fine, filamentous structures. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
