    "intro": "Bahia oblongifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bahia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, but they contribute to its reproductive cycle. It is well adapted to warm climates and is often used in landscaping for its durability and aesthetic appeal. Bahia oblongifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
