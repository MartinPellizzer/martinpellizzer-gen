    "intro": "Blechnum trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are divided into multiple lobes, with the most distinctive feature being the three-lobed shape of the terminal pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical reproductive feature of ferns."
