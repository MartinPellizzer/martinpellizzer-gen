    "intro": "Begonia zunyiensis, commonly known as the Yunnan begonia, is a species native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan province. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its attractive, often heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, are borne on slender stems and are popular among horticulturists for their ornamental value."
