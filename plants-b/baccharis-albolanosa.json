    "intro": "Baccharis albolanosa, commonly known as whiteleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
