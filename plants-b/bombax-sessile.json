    "intro": "Bombax sessile, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a tropical deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters and are often pink or red in color. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth surface. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and has economic importance due to the fibers in its seeds."
