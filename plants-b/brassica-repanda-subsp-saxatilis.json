    "intro": "Brassica repanda subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock mustard, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid environments in southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in crevices and on cliffs, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and hairy. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological resilience and unique morphological features."
