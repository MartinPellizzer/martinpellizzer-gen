It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
