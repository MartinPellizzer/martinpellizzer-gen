    "intro": "Blechnum glandulosum var. distans, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that have short, glandular hairs on their undersides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
