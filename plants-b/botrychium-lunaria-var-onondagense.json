    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. onondagense, commonly known as the Onondaga moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble a cluster of grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in a distinctive, rounded shape at the base of the fronds. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-quality habitats."
