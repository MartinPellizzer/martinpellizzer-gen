    "intro": "Ballota nigra var. mollissima, commonly known as velvet ballota, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a slightly aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in Mediterranean-style landscapes."
