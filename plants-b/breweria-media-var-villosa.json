    "intro": "Breweria media var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy brewer's weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems."
