The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and prefers moist, well-drained soil in partial shade. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its distinctive appearance. Begonia grisea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
