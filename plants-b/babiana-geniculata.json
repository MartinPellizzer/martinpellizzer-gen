It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive zigzag-shaped flower stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.
