    "intro": "Begonia martiana, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia martiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
