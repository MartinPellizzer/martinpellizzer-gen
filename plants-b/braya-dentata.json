    "intro": "Braya dentata, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Braya dentata plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
