    "intro": "Brachypodium littorale, commonly known as sea barley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a small annual grass that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along shorelines. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Brachypodium littorale plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
