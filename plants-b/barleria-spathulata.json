    "intro": "Barleria spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf barleria, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Barleria spathulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
