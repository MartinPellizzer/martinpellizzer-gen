    "intro": "Bletia parkinsonii, commonly known as the pink bletia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Bletia parkinsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
