    "intro": "Bigelowia menziesii var. scopulorum, commonly known as the coastal bigelowia, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
