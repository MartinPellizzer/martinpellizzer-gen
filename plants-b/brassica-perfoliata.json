    "intro": "Brassica perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its fruit is a slender, two-lobed silique that contains several seeds. Brassica perfoliata is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and is often found in rocky soils."
