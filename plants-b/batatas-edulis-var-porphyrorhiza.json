    "intro": "Batatas edulis var. porphyrorhiza, commonly known as the purple sweet potato, is a tuberous root crop native to the Andes region of South America. Its most distinctive botanical feature is its vivid purple to violet skin and flesh, which contains high levels of anthocyanins, giving it its unique coloration. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and produces heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. The tubers are typically harvested after 90 to 120 days and are valued for their nutritional content and ornamental appeal."
