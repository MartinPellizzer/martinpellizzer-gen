    "intro": "Bilabium limans, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with a distinctive lip that is split into two lobes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The orchid has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat."
