    "intro": "Boopis araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a dense, conical crown of needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, amber-colored covering. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species."
