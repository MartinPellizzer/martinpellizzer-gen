    "intro": "Betula acuminatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, often developing fissures as the tree matures. Betula acuminatifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine environments."
