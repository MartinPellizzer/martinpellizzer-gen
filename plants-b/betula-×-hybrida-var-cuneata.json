    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 hybrida var. cuneata, commonly known as the river birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its exfoliating, papery bark that peels in vertical strips, revealing a mottled pattern of white, pink, and gold. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted for its ornamental bark and shade-providing canopy."
