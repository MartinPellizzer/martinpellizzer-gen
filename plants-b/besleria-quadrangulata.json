    "intro": "Besleria quadrangulata, commonly known as the four-cornered begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
