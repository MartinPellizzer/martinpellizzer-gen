    "intro": "Bomarea microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf bomarea, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bomarea microcephala is considered a rare and endangered species."
