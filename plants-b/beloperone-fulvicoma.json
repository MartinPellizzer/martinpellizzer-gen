    "intro": "Beloperone fulvicoma, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
