    "intro": "Brachiaria subulifolia, commonly known as needleleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and dense, low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Brachiaria subulifolia is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in pastureland management."
