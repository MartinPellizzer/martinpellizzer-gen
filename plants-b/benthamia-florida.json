    "intro": "Benthamia florida, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, spoon-shaped leaves and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by the wind. Benthamia florida plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
