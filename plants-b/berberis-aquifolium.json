    "intro": "Berberis aquifolium, commonly known as Oregon grape, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features compound leaves with spiny margins and dark green, glossy foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Berberis aquifolium is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and its resistance to pests and diseases."
