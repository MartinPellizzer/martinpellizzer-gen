    "intro": "Boerhavia rupestris, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and rocky regions. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Boerhavia rupestris is often found in rocky crevices, gravelly plains, and disturbed soils, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
