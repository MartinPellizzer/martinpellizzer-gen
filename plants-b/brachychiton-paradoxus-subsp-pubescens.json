    "intro": "Brachychiton paradoxus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that appear in spring, consisting of numerous small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid regions. The plant is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for native wildlife."
