    "intro": "Bartholina etheliae, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in the mist-laden conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bartholina etheliae is considered a vulnerable species."
