    "intro": "Bartsia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true roots. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its haustoria. It produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Bartsia grandiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
