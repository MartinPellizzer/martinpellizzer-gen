    "intro": "Bletia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Bletia grandiflora thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
