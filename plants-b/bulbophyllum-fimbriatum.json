    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with fringed petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season, making it a notable ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
