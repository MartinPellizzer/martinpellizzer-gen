    "intro": "Berberis divaricata, commonly known as the variegated barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, thorny stems that are often covered in a distinctive variegated foliage, with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns a striking red or orange."
