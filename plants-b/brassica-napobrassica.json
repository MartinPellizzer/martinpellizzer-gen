    "intro": "Brassica napobrassica, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellow, cross-shaped flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. It has been cultivated for its edible leaves and is a close relative of several economically important crops."
