    "intro": "Banksia calophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces woody follicles that contain multiple seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland habitats. Banksia calophylla plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
