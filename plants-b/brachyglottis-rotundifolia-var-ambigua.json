    "intro": "Brachyglottis rotundifolia var. ambigua, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
