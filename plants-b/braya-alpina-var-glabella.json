    "intro": "Braya alpina var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties of Braya alpina."
