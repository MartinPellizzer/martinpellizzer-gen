    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium var. hesperium, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus, which is a key feature for identification. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its habitat."
