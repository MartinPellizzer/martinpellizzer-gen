It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
