    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 pseudocarpatica, commonly known as the golden birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula jacquemontii, resulting in a species with distinctive golden-yellow bark. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish color underneath. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Betula \u00d7 pseudocarpatica is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its striking bark and seasonal color changes."
