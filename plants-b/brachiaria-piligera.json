    "intro": "Brachiaria piligera, commonly known as the hairy signal grass, is a tropical and subtropical grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, thriving in warm climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, contributing to its role in pasture and erosion control. Brachiaria piligera is also valued for its adaptability and resilience to grazing and environmental stress."
