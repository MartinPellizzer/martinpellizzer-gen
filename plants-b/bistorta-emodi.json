    "intro": "Bistorta emodi, commonly known as the Himalayan bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a thick, rhizomatous root system and erect, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender spikes. Its leaves and roots are used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Bistorta emodi thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
