    "intro": "Brillantaisia ulugurica, commonly known as the Ulugurian bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brillantaisia ulugurica is considered a vulnerable species."
