    "intro": "Baccharis anomala subsp. andina, commonly known as Andean baccharis, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to high-altitude environments. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
