    "intro": "Bletilla morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
