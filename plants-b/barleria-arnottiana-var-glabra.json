It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and hairless. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
