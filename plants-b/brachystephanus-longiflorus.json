    "intro": "Brachystephanus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered stephanus, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, elongated inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces vividly colored blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure that supports its epiphytic or terrestrial growth. This species is native to the cloud forests of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
