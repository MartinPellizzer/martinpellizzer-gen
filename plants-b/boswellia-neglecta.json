    "intro": "Boswellia neglecta, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes other frankincense-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its most notable feature is the resin it exudes, which has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine. The botanical structure of Boswellia neglecta supports its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments through its adaptations such as reduced leaf size and deep root systems."
