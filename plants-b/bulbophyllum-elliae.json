    "intro": "Bulbophyllum elliae, commonly known as the Ellie's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
