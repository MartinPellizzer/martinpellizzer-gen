It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, known for its mustard-like flowers and ecological importance to pollinators."
