    "intro": "Bromus villosus subsp. rigidus, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of a single, compact panicle. It produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
