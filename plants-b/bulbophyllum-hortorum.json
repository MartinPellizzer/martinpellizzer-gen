    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hortorum, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, often yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bulbophyllum hortorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
