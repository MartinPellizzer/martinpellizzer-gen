It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Bonamia angustifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
