    "intro": "Begonia maxima, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and beauty, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
