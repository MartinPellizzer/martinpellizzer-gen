    "intro": "Bursera gracilis, commonly known as the slender bursera, is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Bursera gracilis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
