    "intro": "Bulbophyllum codonanthum, commonly known as the Codonanthe Bulbophyllum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically greenish-white to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, and it relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the rocky substrate. This species is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to specific growing conditions."
