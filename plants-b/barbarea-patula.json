    "intro": "Barbarea patula, commonly known as the common winter cress, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release the seeds. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Barbarea patula is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows."
