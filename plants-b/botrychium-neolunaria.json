    "intro": "Botrychium neolunaria, commonly known as the moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spirally twisted fronds that resemble a cluster of grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a distinctive reproductive structure called a sporangium, which produces and releases spores for propagation. Botrychium neolunaria is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
