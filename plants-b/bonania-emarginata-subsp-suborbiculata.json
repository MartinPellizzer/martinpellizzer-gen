    "intro": "Bonania emarginata subsp. suborbiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bonania, is a small shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves with a distinctive emarginate (notched) tip. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. This subspecies is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
