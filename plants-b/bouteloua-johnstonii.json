It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, making it a valuable component of native plant communities. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
