    "intro": "Betula humilis var. cuneata, commonly known as the dwarf birch or mountain birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and oval to lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in alpine or boreal habitats. Betula humilis var. cuneata is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in poor, rocky soils."
