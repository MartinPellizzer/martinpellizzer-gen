    "intro": "Bromus confertus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open fields, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned flowers. Bromus confertus is often found in agricultural areas and is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
