    "intro": "Barringtonia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan lantern tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, lantern-shaped flowers that hang from the branches. The plant produces fruit that splits open to release its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture and a distinctive waxy coating. Barringtonia yunnanensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
