    "intro": "Bactris cruegeriana, commonly known as the Mexican buriti, is a palm native to Central and South America. It is a robust, medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers followed by edible, fibrous fruits that are important in local diets. Its leaves are used for thatching and weaving, and the trunk provides material for construction. The species is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
