    "intro": "Banksia saligna, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. Banksia saligna is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
