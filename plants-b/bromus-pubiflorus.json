    "intro": "Bromus pubiflorus, commonly known as the pubiflorous brome, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing tiny flowers that produce small, three-angled grains. Bromus pubiflorus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptation to arid environments and its role in soil stabilization."
