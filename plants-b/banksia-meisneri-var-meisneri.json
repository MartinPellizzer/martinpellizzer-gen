    "intro": "Banksia meisneri var. meisneri, commonly known as the Meisner's banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
