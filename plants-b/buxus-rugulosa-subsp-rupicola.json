    "intro": "Buxus rugulosa subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock box, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a topiary plant. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
