    "intro": "Baccharis gnaphalioides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, disturbed sites, and open woodlands. Baccharis gnaphalioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
