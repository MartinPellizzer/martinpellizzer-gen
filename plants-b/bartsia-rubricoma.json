It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true roots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in whorls. Bartsia rubricoma is notable for its reddish stems and its role in supporting local insect populations."
