    "intro": "Billotia alpina, commonly known as the alpine billotia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. This perennial herb typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, blooming in the spring and early summer."
