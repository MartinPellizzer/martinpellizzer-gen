    "intro": "Becium coddii, commonly known as the Codd's becium, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces a distinctive seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Becium coddii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
