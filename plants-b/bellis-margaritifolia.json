    "intro": "Bellis margaritifolia, commonly known as the pearlweed or white mouse-ear. This low-growing perennial plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. Its small, white, daisy-like flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to gardens. The plant has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
