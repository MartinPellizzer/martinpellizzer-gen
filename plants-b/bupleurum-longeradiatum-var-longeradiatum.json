It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
