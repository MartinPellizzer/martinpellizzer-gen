    "intro": "Betula chinensis var. collina, commonly known as the Chinese birch or mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a shiny, dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. This species is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
