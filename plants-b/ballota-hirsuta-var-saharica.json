    "intro": "Ballota hirsuta var. saharica, commonly known as the Saharan ballota, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its hairy, grayish foliage helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Ballota hirsuta var. saharica is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
