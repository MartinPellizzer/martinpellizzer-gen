    "intro": "Bejaria cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that resemble cinnamon sticks, hence its common name. The plant has a distinctive underground rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread vegetatively. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Bejaria cinnamomea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
