It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant produces long, narrow pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Butea superba is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in Ayurvedic medicine."
