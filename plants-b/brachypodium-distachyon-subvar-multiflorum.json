    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon subvar. multiflorum, commonly known as the multiflorous false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subvariety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
