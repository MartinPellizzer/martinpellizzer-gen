    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
