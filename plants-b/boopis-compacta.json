It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Boopis compacta produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators."
