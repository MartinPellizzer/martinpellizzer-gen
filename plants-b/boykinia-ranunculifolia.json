    "intro": "Boykinia ranunculifolia, commonly known as the rock scilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually basal, while the flowering stems are usually shorter than the foliage. Boykinia ranunculifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult, rocky environments."
