    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lyperocephalum, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
