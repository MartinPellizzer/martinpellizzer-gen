    "intro": "Bihai brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bihai brasiliensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in horticultural displays."
