    "intro": "Bogoria ramuana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous areas with rich, organic soil. The plant has feathery, delicate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue, which helps it retain moisture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common to most ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
