It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the nodes, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small, clustered, and have five petals, often in shades of white or pink. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain less studied compared to other members of its family."
