It is characterized by its striking orange to red floral display, which appears in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Butea minor thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant, seasonal flowers."
