    "intro": "Banisteria macradena, commonly known as the red spider flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble spider-like structures, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Banisteria macradena is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
