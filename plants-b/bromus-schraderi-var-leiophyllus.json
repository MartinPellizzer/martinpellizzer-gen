    "intro": "Bromus schraderi var. leiophyllus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
