    "intro": "Baeria chrysostoma f. aristosa, commonly known as the golden beard gentian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the plant. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
