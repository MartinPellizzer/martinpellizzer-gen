    "intro": "Balanophora trimera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Balanophora trimera is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
