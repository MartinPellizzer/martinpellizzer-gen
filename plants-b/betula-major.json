    "intro": "Betula major, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silvery underside, and its alternate, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula major is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively fast-growing, making it a common species in forested areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
