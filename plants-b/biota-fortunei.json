    "intro": "Biota fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath a modified leaf called a spathe. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Biota fortunei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
