    "intro": "Biscutella sempervirens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
