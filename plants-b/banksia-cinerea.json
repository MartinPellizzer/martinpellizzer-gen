    "intro": "Banksia cinerea, commonly known as the silver banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has fibrous, silver-gray bark that peels away in strips, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Banksia cinerea plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly nectar-feeding birds and insects."
