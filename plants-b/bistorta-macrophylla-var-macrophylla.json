    "intro": "Bistorta macrophylla var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Bistorta macrophylla var. macrophylla is often found in woodland soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
