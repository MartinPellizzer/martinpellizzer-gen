    "intro": "Bernhardia oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rock crevices. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernhardia oahuensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
