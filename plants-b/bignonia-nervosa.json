    "intro": "Bignonia nervosa, commonly known as the yellow trumpetbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins, and its most striking characteristic is its showy, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bignonia nervosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
