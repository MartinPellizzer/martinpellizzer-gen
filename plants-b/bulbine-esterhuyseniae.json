It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
