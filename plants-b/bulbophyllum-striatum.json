    "intro": "Bulbophyllum striatum, commonly known as the striped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often strikingly patterned leaves and elongated, pendant-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate markings, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Bulbophyllum striatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
