    "intro": "Bradburia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bracken fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with the underground stems producing new shoots and roots. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
