    "intro": "Baccharis pedalis, commonly known as saltbush or coastal baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Baccharis pedalis is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
