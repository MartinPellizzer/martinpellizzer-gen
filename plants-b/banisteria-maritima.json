    "intro": "Banisteria maritima, commonly known as sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Banisteria maritima is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal species."
