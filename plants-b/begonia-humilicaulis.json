    "intro": "Begonia humilicaulis, commonly known as the low-stemmed begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright, slender stems that often grow close to the ground, with heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Begonia humilicaulis is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
