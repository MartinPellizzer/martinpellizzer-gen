    "intro": "Byttneria biloba var. bauhinioides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
