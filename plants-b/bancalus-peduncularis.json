    "intro": "Bancalus peduncularis, commonly known as the longhorned beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and prominent antennae, which are often longer than its body. The larvae of this species are typically found in decaying wood, where they feed on the cellulose and contribute to the decomposition process. The adult beetles are often seen on the bark of trees, particularly during the warmer months. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by aiding in the breakdown of dead wood and recycling nutrients."
