    "intro": "Buxus macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Buxus macrocarpa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form compact, sculptural shapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile choice for hedging and topiary."
