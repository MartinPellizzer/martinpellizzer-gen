    "intro": "Braya gamosepala, commonly known as the broad-leafed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Braya gamosepala is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
