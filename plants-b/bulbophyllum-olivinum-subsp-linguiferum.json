    "intro": "Bulbophyllum olivinum subsp. linguiferum, commonly known as the tongue-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that have a distinctive, elongated lip resembling a tongue. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
