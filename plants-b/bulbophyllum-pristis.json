    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pristis, commonly known as the sword-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth during dry periods. Its leaves are long and sword-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, and are pollinated by insects."
