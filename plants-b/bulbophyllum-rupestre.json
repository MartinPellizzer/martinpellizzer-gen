    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rupestre, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
