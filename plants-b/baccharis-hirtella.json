    "intro": "Baccharis hirtella, commonly known as velvetleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib. Baccharis hirtella is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
