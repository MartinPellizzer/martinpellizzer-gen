    "intro": "Buxus citrifolia var. fuscescens, commonly known as the black boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns a deep shade of blackish-green in the winter. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and emits a subtle, sweet fragrance. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form compact, sculptural shapes."
