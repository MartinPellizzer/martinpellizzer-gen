    "intro": "Buxus linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. Buxus linearifolia prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and foundation plantings."
