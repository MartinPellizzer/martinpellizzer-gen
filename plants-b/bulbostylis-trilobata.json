    "intro": "Bulbostylis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed bulbostylis, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a basal rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. Bulbostylis trilobata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats where it thrives in the humid, nutrient-rich environment."
