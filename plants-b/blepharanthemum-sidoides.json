    "intro": "Blepharanthemum sidoides, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period."
