    "intro": "Baccharis baldwinii, commonly known as Baldwin's baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as plains and rocky hillsides. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, white to yellowish flower clusters in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
