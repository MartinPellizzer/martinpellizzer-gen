    "intro": "Baccharoides guineensis var. procera, commonly known as the tall marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. It is often found in swampy areas and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
