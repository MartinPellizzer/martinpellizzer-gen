    "intro": "Bridelia speciosa var. kourousensis, commonly known as the Kourous endemic brideliate, is a shrub native to the island of Kouroussia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
