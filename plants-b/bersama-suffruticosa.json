    "intro": "Bersama suffruticosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a dense, spiny structure that helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and contains a sweet, pulp-like interior. Bersama suffruticosa is well adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall."
