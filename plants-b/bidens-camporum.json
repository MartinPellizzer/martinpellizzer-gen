    "intro": "Bidens camporum, commonly known as yellow beggarweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and sunny environments. It is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
