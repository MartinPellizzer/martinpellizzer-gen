    "intro": "Berberis jelskiana, commonly known as the Kashmiri barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
