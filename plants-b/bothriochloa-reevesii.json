    "intro": "Bothriochloa reevesii, commonly known as Reeves' panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded meadows, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots and its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
