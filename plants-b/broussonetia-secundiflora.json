    "intro": "Broussonetia secundiflora, commonly known as Chinese sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate with 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense panicles, followed by orange to red fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Broussonetia secundiflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
