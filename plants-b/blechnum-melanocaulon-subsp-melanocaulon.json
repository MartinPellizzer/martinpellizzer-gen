    "intro": "Blechnum melanocaulon subsp. melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed sword fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically upright and sword-shaped. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
