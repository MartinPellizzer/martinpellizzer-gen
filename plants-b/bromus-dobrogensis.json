    "intro": "Bromus dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Bromus dobrogensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
