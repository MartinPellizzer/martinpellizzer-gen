    "intro": "Barberina rhamnifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"milk tree.\" Barberina rhamnifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
