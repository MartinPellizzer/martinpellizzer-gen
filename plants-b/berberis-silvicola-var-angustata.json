It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, often with a reddish or bronze hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other barberry species."
