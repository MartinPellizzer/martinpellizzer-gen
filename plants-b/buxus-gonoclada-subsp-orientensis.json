    "intro": "Buxus gonoclada subsp. orientensis, commonly known as the Eastern boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to parts of Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden borders and topiary. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used in landscape design for its ornamental value and ease of maintenance."
