    "intro": "Banksia ornata, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flower spikes, which appear in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia ornata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. It plays an important role in the ecological communities of its native habitat."
