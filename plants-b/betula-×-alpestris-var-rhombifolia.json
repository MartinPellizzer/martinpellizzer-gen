    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 alpestris var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the mountain paper birch, is a hybrid species of birch tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, papery texture. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, and its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to grow in challenging environmental conditions."
