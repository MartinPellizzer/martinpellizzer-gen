    "intro": "Bryobium cordiferum subsp. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean heartleaf bryobium, is a unique member of the family Hypnaceae. It is a small, evergreen moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or in forest undergrowth. The plant is characterized by its cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which are often curled and have a leathery texture. It exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct cellular differentiation, which is typical of mosses in the genus Bryobium. This subspecies is endemic to Borneo and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
