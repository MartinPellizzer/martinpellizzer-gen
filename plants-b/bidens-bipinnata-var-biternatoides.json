It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with white markings, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are equipped with bristly appendages that aid in wind dispersal."
