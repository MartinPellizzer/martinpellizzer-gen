    "intro": "Borinda nivalis, commonly known as the alpine borinda, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Borinda nivalis is often found in mountainous regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru."
