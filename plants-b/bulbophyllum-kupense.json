    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kupense, commonly known as the Kupense orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Bulbophyllum kupense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
