    "intro": "Blechnum pazense, commonly known as the Pacific water fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. Blechnum pazense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
