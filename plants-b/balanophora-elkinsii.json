    "intro": "Balanophora elkinsii, commonly known as the Elkins' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a fully mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shaded, moist environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide essential carbohydrates. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
