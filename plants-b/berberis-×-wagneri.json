    "intro": "Berberis \u00d7 wagneri, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a hybrid shrub native to China. It features dense, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
