    "intro": "Begonia mazae, commonly known as the Mazae begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its attractive, often brightly colored bracts that surround its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and deeply veined. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce numerous blooms throughout the growing season."
