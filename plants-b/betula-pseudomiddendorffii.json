    "intro": "Betula pseudomiddendorffii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a pointed tip and serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male and female, and it relies on wind pollination. This species is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting resilience to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
