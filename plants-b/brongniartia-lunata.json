    "intro": "Brongniartia lunata, commonly known as the moonflower cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its cones are distinctive, with a spiny structure that protects the seeds. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
