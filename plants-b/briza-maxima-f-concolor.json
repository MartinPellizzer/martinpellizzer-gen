    "intro": "Briza maxima f. concolor, commonly known as the common quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems with delicate, feathery inflorescences that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
