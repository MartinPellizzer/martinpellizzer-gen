    "intro": "Beccarianthus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy beccarianthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants found in tropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
