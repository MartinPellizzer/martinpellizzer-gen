It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, showy white flowers that emit a strong fragrance at night. The plant belongs to the genus Barringtonia in the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Its flowers are designed for pollination by nocturnal insects and bats, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.
