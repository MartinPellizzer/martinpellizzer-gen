    "intro": "Betula davurica var. americana, commonly known as the American birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
