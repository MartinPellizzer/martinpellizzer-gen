    "intro": "Brathydium chamaenerium, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in arid gardens."
