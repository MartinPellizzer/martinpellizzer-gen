It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale purple to white ray florets. The species is notable for its finely dissected leaves and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
