    "intro": "Berberis sibirica f. subintegerrima, commonly known as the Siberian barberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, thorny stems that are often covered with a dense layer of grayish-white bark. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but tart. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
