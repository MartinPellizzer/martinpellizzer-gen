    "intro": "Bobartia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless bobartia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
