    "intro": "Bromelia fernandae, commonly known as the Fernand\u00e1 fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bromelia fernandae is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
