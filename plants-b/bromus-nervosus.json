    "intro": "Bromus nervosus, commonly known as the nervy brome, is a species of grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive nervy appearance, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. Bromus nervosus is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
