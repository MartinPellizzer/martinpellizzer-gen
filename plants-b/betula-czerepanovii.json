    "intro": "Betula czerepanovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn golden in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Betula czerepanovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
