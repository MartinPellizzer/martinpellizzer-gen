    "intro": "Benthamia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a compact inflorescence, and it produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Benthamia humbertii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
