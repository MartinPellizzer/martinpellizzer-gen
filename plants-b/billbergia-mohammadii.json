    "intro": "Billbergia mohammadii, commonly known as the Mohammadi's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool. Its foliage is often adorned with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Billbergia mohammadii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
