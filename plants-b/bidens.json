    "intro": "Bidens, commonly known as tickseed or beggar's ticks, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive yellow flowers, which often have a black or purple center. Bidens species are native to the Americas and are commonly found in a variety of habitats, including wetlands and disturbed soils. They are annual or perennial herbs that produce small, hairy seeds that can cling to animals and clothing. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and some are used in traditional medicine."
