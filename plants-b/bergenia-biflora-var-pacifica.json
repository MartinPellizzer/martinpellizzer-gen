    "intro": "Bergenia biflora var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific bergenia, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often-dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, sturdy stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that help prevent erosion."
