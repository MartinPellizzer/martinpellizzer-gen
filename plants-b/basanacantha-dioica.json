    "intro": "Basanacantha dioica, commonly known as the two-flowered basana, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Basanacantha dioica is noted for its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants."
