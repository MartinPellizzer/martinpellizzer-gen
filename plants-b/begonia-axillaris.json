It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a fragrant scent. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
