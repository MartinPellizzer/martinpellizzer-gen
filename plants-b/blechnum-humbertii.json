It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures. The botanical features of Blechnum humbertii make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
