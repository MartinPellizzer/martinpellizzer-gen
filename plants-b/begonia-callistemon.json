    "intro": "Begonia callistemon, commonly known as the flame begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and containers."
