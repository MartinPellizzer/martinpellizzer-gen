    "intro": "Berberis rigida, commonly known as the rough barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Berberis rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, as it contains berberine, a compound with antimicrobial effects."
