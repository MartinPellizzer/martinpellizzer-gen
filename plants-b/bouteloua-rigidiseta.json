    "intro": "Bouteloua rigidiseta, commonly known as rigid bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. The species is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects."
