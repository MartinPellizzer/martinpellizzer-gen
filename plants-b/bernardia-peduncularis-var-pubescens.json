    "intro": "Bernardia peduncularis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bernardia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
