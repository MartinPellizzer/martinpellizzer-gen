It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
