    "intro": "Bruguiera decandra, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has a robust root system that includes pneumatophores, specialized structures for oxygen absorption in waterlogged soils. It thrives in coastal areas, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an essential component of mangrove forests."
