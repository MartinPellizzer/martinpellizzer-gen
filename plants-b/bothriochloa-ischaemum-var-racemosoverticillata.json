    "intro": "Bothriochloa ischaemum var. racemosoverticillata, commonly known as the racemose overwedge grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces inflorescences that are both racemose and verticillate, meaning they have both elongated clusters and whorled arrangements of spikelets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This variant is notable for its unique floral structure, which contributes to its ecological and botanical significance."
