    "intro": "Bactris maraja var. sobralensis, commonly known as the Sobral palm, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-orange inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits resembling small cherries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
