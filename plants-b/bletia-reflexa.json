    "intro": "Bletia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Bletia reflexa has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in humid, low-light conditions. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and flies."
