    "intro": "Biscutella coronopifolia subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous biscuit flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and reproductive strategies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
