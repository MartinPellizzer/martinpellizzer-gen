    "intro": "Butomus vulgaris, commonly known as the bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance and distinctive triangular stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and stabilize soil. Butomus vulgaris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life and aiding in water filtration."
