    "intro": "Bistorta amplexicaulis var. dhorpatanensis, commonly known as the Dhorpatan bistort, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often clasping around the stem, a feature typical of the genus Bistorta. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
