    "intro": "Batschia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Batschia decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
