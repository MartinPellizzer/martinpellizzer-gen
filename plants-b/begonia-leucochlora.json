    "intro": "Begonia leucochlora, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
