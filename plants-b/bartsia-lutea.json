    "intro": "Bartsia lutea, commonly known as the yellow bartsia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Bartsia lutea is not widely cultivated but is occasionally found in wildflower gardens due to its ornamental value."
