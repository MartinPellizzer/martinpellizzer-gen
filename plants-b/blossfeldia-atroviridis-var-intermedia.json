It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is native to Brazil, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant is distinguished by its elongated, segmented stems and clusters of fragrant, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the holiday season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
