    "intro": "Bromus compressus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, compressed stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus compressus is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession due to its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly."
