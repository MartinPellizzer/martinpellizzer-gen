    "intro": "Bridelia mollis, commonly known as the silky bridelia, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Bridelia mollis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
