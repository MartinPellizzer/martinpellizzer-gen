    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum f. orbelicum, commonly known as the Orbelic goat's beard, is a botanical variant of the common goat's beard. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and parts of Turkey. The plant features slender, somewhat curved leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This form is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical variety of Bupleurum falcatum."
