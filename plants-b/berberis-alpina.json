    "intro": "Berberis alpina, commonly known as the alpine barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant features thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. Its flowers are yellow and appear in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp taste. Berberis alpina is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
