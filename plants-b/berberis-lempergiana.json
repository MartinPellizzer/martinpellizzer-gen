It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It is characterized by its thorny stems and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. This species is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging conditions."
