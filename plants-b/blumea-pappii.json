It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Blumea pappii is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is hairy, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat."
