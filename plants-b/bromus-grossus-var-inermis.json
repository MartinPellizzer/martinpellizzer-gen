    "intro": "Bromus grossus var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tufted growth with slender, leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with pale green to brown glumes. Its leaves are typically narrow and smooth, contributing to its common name. This grass is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites, and is valued for its forage qualities."
