    "intro": "Bougainvillea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian paper flower, is a vibrant, flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers that are less conspicuous than the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea peruviana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to grow on trellises or as a shrub."
