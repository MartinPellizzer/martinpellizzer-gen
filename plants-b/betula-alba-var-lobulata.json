    "intro": "Betula alba var. lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role and is often used in landscape design due to its aesthetic and hardy nature."
