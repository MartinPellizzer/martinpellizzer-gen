    "intro": "Berberis darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in temperate regions."
