    "intro": "Baskervilla janeirensis, commonly known as the Janeirensis Baskervilla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-pink tubular flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is typically found growing in rocky crevices and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
