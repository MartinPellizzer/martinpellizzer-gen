    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile var. trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy water frog plant, is a aquatic plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate while allowing for the spread of new growth. The flowers are small and clustered, often producing nectar to attract pollinators like bees and flies."
