    "intro": "Bauhinia dubia, commonly known as the flame tree or yellow flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that resemble feathery structures, and its showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow to orange-red. The flowers are typically followed by flat, papery pods that contain several seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
