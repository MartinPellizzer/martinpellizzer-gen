    "intro": "Bauhinia sylvani, commonly known as the silky sycamore, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Bauhinia sylvani is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
