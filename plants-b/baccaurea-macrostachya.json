    "intro": "Baccaurea macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked mangosteen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to mangosteens but are less commonly consumed. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often covered in short, stiff hairs. Baccaurea macrostachya is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for both its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
