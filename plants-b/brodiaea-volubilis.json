    "intro": "Brodiaea volubilis, commonly known as the climbing brodiaea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Brodiaea volubilis is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral environments."
