    "intro": "Bromus intermedius subsp. divaricatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of spikelets, which are the basic units of grass flowers. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
