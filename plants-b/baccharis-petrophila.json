    "intro": "Baccharis petrophila, commonly known as the desert gum plant, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis petrophila plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
