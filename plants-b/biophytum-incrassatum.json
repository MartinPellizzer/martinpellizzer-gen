    "intro": "Biophytum incrassatum, commonly known as the thick-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the cooler months. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements. Biophytum incrassatum is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
