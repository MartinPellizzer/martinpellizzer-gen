    "intro": "Bromus littoreus, commonly known as coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Bromus littoreus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
