    "intro": "Begonia sinuata var. sinuata, commonly known as the wavy-leaved begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
