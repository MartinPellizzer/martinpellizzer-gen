It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many succulent plants adapted to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It produces tiny white flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and inconspicuous appearance. Barosma unicarpellata is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions."
