    "intro": "Bactris elegantissima, commonly known as the pink palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, single trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that eventually develop into edible, red-orange fruits. Bactris elegantissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and landscapes."
