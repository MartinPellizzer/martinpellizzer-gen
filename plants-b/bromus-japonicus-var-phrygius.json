    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. phrygius, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-green hue, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
