    "intro": "Baccharoides calycina, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal ecosystems. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with woody stems that help it withstand strong winds. Baccharoides calycina plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
