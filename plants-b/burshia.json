The plant belongs to the family Cactaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months. Burshia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
