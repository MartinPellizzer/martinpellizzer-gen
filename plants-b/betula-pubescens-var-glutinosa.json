    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name and makes it distinct from other birch species. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are triangular with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forests. The sticky birch is an important species for wildlife, providing food and habitat for various insects and birds."
