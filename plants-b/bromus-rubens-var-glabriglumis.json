    "intro": "Bromus rubens var. glabriglumis, commonly known as the smooth glume browntop, is a grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with elongated, narrow leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as wet meadows, roadside ditches, and along stream banks. Its smooth glumes distinguish it from other varieties in the Bromus genus. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
