    "intro": "Bulbophyllum colubrimodum, commonly known as the snake-like orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant produces striking, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or green with intricate patterns, resembling the scales of a snake. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to specific growing conditions."
