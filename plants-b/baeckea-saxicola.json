    "intro": "Baeckea saxicola, commonly known as the rock baeckea, is a small shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Baeckea saxicola is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
