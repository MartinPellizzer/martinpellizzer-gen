    "intro": "Benzoin obtusum, commonly known as Indian benzoin, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elongated, woody capsules containing its seeds. Benzoin obtusum is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
