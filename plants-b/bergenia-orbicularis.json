    "intro": "Bergenia orbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in early spring. The leaves are broad, round, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
