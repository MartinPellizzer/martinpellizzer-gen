    "intro": "Bunium microcarpum subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the mountain fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, narrow fruits known as mericarps, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
