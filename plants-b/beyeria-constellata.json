It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Beyeria constellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
