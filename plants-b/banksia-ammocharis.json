    "intro": "Banksia ammocharis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Banksia ammocharis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and open forest habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly honeyeaters and other nectar-feeding birds."
