    "intro": "Bartlingia minor, commonly known as the dwarf Bartlingia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. Bartlingia minor is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
