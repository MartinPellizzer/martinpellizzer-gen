It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
