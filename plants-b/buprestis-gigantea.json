    "intro": "Buprestis gigantea, commonly known as the giant metallic wood-boring beetle, is a species of jewel beetle native to the forests of North America. It is characterized by its striking metallic green or blue exoskeleton, which shimmers under light due to structural coloration. The larvae of this species are known to bore into the wood of living trees, where they feed and develop over several years. Adult beetles are typically found in the canopy of trees, where they feed on nectar and pollen. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the decomposition of woody material and serving as a food source for various predators."
