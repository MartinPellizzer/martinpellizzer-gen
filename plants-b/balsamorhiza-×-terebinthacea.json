    "intro": "Balsamorhiza \u00d7 terebinthacea, commonly known as the yellow balsamroot, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant features a robust, upright stem with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator plant and its ornamental value in native gardens."
