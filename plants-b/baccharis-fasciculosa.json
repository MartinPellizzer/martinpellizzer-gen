    "intro": "Baccharis fasciculosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy clusters of white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
