    "intro": "Bromus polyanthus, commonly known as the redstem mousegrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive reddish tint along the midrib. Bromus polyanthus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and ease of cultivation."
