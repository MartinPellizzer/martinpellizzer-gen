    "intro": "Betula alba var. pendula, commonly known as weeping birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, and its leaves are oval with a serrated edge. It is valued for its ornamental appearance, with white bark and delicate, pendulous branches that create a striking visual effect in gardens and natural landscapes."
