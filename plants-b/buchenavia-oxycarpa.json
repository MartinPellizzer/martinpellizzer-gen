    "intro": "Buchenavia oxycarpa, commonly known as the sour fig or red fig, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Buchenavia oxycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
