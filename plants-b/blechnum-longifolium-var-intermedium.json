    "intro": "Blechnum longifolium var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are divided into pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller, serrated segments."
