    "intro": "Breweria oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf breweria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive seed structures. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from green to red. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Breweria oxycarpa is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
