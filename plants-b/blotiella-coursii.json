    "intro": "Blotiella coursii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It typically blooms during the cooler months, adapting to the extreme temperature fluctuations of its habitat. Blotiella coursii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
