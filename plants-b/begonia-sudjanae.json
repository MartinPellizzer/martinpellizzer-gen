    "intro": "Begonia sudjanae, commonly known as the Sujana's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
