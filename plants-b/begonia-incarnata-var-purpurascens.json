    "intro": "Begonia incarnata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple foliage that contrasts beautifully with its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 12 to 18 inches and thrives in partial shade with moist, well-draining soil. Its leaves are often used in ornamental gardening for their vibrant color and texture. It is a popular choice for container gardening and as a ground cover in shaded garden areas."
