    "intro": "Bambusa heterocycla, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a species of grass in the family Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms, which distinguish it from other bamboo species. The plant grows in clumps and can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its culms are hollow and jointed, typical of the bamboo genus, and are used in construction and crafts. Bambusa heterocycla is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
