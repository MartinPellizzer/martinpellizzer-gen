    "intro": "Betula persicifolia, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and is known for its aromatic, sweet-smelling sap, which has been used historically for its medicinal properties. Betula persicifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
