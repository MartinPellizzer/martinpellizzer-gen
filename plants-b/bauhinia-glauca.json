    "intro": "Bauhinia glauca, commonly known as the blue bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in clusters. Bauhinia glauca is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
