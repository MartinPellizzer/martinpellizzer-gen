    "intro": "Bauhinia linnaei, commonly known as the small-leaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Bauhinia linnaei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
