    "intro": "Brachiaria stolonifera, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stems that spread along the ground and produce roots at the nodes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils. Brachiaria stolonifera is often used in pastureland and as a groundcover due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats."
