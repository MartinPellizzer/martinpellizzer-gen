    "intro": "Bladhia japonica, commonly known as Japanese bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes and have a coarse texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive bladder-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Bladhia japonica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
