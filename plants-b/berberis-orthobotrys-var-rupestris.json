    "intro": "Berberis orthobotrys var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
