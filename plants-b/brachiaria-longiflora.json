    "intro": "Brachiaria longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered brachiaria, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It has fibrous roots that help in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its foliage is often grazed by livestock, making it an important forage plant in some regions."
