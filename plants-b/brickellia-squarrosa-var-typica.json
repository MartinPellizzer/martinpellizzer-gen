    "intro": "Brickellia squarrosa var. typica, commonly known as the woolly brickellbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States. It features erect, branching stems covered in dense, white to grayish woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and also covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its tactile texture. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal heads and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas."
