    "intro": "Begonia dentata, commonly known as the serrated begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, and the flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Begonia dentata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
