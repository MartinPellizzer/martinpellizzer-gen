    "intro": "Betula neoborealis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal and subarctic forests. Betula neoborealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
