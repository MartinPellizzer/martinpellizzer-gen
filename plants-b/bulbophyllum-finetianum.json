    "intro": "Bulbophyllum finetianum, commonly known as the Finetian Pterostigma, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its rhizomatous growth and erect, leafy stems. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with showy, often contrasting petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
