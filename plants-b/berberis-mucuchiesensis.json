    "intro": "Berberis mucuchiesensis, commonly known as the Peruvian barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and research settings."
