    "intro": "Banksia sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Banksia sessilis plays an important ecological role by providing food for native wildlife and supporting biodiversity in its habitat."
