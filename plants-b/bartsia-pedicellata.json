    "intro": "Bartsia pedicellata, commonly known as the small-flowered bartsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heaths, relying on its host plants for nutrients. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Bartsia pedicellata is often found in association with other hemiparasitic plants and plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat."
