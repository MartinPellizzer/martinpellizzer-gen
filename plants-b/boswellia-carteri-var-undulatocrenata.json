    "intro": "Boswellia carteri var. undulatocrenata, commonly known as the Somali frankincense tree, is a species native to the dry, arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested for its aromatic and medicinal properties. This variety is distinguished by its undulating, wavy leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its native habitat."
