    "intro": "Buniella chaerophylloides, commonly known as the mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
