    "intro": "Botrychium daucifolium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, upright rhizome with a rosette of dark green, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium daucifolium is found across much of Europe, Asia, and North America, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems as a cryptogamic component."
