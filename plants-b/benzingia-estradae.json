    "intro": "Benzingia estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's spurge, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and often milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory vegetation. Its small, green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Benzingia estradae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
