    "intro": "Bahel, commonly known as *Aerva lanata*, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. Bahel is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
