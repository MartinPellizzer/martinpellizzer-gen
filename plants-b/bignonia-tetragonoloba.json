    "intro": "Bignonia tetragonoloba, commonly known as crossvine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow-orange, four-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 20 feet in length, often climbing trees or trellises. Crossvine is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full sun."
