    "intro": "Berberis chillacochensis, commonly known as the Chillacocho barberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
