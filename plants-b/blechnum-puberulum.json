    "intro": "Blechnum puberulum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, soft fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental value."
