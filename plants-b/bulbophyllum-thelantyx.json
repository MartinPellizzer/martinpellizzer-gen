    "intro": "Bulbophyllum thelantyx, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its delicate nature and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in the wild."
