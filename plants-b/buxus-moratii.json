    "intro": "Buxus moratii, commonly known as the Morat boxwood, is a rare and ancient species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus moratii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its ability to form dense hedges. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
