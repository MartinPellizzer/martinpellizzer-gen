It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, and the bark is often reddish in color. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
