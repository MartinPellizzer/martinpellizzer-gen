    "intro": "Byrsonima cacaophila, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Surinam cherry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. The fruit is edible, though the pulp is often used in beverages and traditional remedies due to its tart flavor and nutritional content."
