    "intro": "Bunchosia missionum, commonly known as the Mission Bunchosia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that are edible but often considered bland. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
