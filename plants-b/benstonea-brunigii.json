    "intro": "Benstonea brunigii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals that form a star-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Benstonea brunigii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
