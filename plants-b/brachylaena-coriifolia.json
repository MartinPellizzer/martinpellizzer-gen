    "intro": "Brachylaena coriifolia, commonly known as the silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the winter months, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
