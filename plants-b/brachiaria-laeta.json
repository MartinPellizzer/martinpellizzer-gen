    "intro": "Brachiaria laeta, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats. Brachiaria laeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
