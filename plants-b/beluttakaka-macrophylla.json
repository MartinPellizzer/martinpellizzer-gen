    "intro": "Beluttakaka macrophylla, commonly known as the giant broadleaf fern, is a striking plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant's fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular subject in both botanical research and horticultural displays."
