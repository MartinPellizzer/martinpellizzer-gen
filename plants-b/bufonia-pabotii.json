    "intro": "Bufonia pabotii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the savannas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers open at night and close by dawn, a trait that aids in pollination by reducing competition with diurnal flowers. Bufonia pabotii is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming habit."
