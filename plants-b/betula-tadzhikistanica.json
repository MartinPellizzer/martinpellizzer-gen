    "intro": "Betula tadzhikistanica, commonly known as the Tajikistan birch, is a species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Tajikistan. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments, often found in alpine zones. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, and its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are an important part of its reproductive cycle. This species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
