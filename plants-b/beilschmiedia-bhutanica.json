    "intro": "Beilschmiedia bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and northeastern India. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by dark purple, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at mid to high elevations, often found in primary and secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
