    "intro": "Baccharis polylepis, commonly known as the Andean dwarf bush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Baccharis polylepis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
