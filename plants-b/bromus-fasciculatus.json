    "intro": "Bromus fasciculatus, commonly known as blue brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with blue-gray glumes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color that gives it its common name. Bromus fasciculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
