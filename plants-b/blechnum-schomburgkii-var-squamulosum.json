    "intro": "Blechnum schomburgkii var. squamulosum, commonly known as the squamulose water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Blechnum. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant is native to parts of South America and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic and humid garden settings."
