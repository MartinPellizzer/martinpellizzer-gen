It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat.
