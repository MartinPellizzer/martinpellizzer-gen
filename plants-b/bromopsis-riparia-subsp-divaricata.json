    "intro": "Bromopsis riparia subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulblet grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in grasslands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to seasonal flooding."
