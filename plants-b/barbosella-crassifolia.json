It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in clusters. Barbosella crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
