    "intro": "Betula tricholepidea subsp. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a member of the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of other birch species. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important source of pollen for early pollinators. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. This subspecies is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
