    "intro": "Blechnum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific harts-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically fan-shaped and have a distinctive, tongue-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum pacificum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
