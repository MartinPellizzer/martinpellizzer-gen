    "intro": "Bulbine cepacea, commonly known as the yellow bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
