    "intro": "Bromus parilicus, commonly known as the parilus brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in a compact, cylindrical inflorescence. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions. Bromus parilicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for forage in certain regions."
