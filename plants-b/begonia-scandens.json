It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of bright red, spurred flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil. This plant is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its vigorous growth habit."
