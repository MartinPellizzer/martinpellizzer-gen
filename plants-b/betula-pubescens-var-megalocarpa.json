    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant-fruit birch, is a variant of the downy birch native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its large, elongated fruits that can reach up to 4 cm in length, distinguishing it from other birch species. The tree typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in autumn. The bark is smooth and white when young, becoming fissured with age, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
