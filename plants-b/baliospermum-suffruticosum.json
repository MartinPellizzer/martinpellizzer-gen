It is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
