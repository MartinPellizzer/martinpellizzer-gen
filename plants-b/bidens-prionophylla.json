    "intro": "Bidens prionophylla, commonly known as the slender beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers with distinctive white markings. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and is considered a common weed in disturbed areas."
