    "intro": "Bumelia subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bumelia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bumelia subsessiliflora is often found in dry, open woodlands and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
