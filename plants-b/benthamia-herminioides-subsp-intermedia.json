    "intro": "Benthamia herminioides subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces yellow composite flowers, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
