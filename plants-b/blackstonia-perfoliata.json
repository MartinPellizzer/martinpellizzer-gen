    "intro": "Blackstonia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are fused around the stem, creating a perfoliate appearance. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Blackstonia perfoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
