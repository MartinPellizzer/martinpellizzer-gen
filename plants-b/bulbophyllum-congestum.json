    "intro": "Bulbophyllum congestum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces multiple flowering stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Bulbophyllum congestum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
