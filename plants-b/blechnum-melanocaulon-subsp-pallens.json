    "intro": "Blechnum melanocaulon subsp. pallens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit that contributes to its ornamental value."
