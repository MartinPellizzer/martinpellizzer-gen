    "intro": "Bellevalia pycnantha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Bellevalia pycnantha is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
