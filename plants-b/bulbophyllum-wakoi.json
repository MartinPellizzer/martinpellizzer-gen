    "intro": "Bulbophyllum wakoi, commonly known as the Wakoi orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting the plant's foliage and flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
