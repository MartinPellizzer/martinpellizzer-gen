    "intro": "Betula alba var. communis, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in woodland and parkland areas."
