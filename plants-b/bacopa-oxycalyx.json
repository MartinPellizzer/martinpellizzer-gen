    "intro": "Bacopa oxycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that help it thrive in wetland environments. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported cognitive and calming effects. Bacopa oxycalyx is typically found in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along riverbanks."
