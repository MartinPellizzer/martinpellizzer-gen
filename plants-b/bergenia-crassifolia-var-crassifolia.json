    "intro": "Bergenia crassifolia var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bergenia, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a dense, low-growing ground cover. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are borne on sturdy, upright stems. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time."
