    "intro": "Bassia carnosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Bassia carnosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
