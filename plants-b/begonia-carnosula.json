    "intro": "Begonia carnosula, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia carnosula is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
