    "intro": "Berberis pruinosa var. centiflora, commonly known as the centiflorous barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and vibrant seasonal display make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and borders."
