    "intro": "Begonia consanguinea, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia consanguinea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
