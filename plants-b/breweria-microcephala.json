    "intro": "Breweria microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed breweria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypselae. Breweria microcephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and distinctive appearance."
