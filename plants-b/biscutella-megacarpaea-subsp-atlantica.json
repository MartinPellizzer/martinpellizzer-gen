It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal flora."
