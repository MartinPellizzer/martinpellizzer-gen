It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are often hairy and vary in shape, while its flowers bloom in shades of blue to purple. Blitum polymorphum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
