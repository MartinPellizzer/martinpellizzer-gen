    "intro": "Betula nana var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is typically smooth and peeling, with a pale or reddish color. This hardy species thrives in harsh, cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine environments."
