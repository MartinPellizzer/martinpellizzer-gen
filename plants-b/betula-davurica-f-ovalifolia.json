    "intro": "Betula davurica f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf birch, is a variant of the dwarf birch species native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller and more pointed compared to the standard variety. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its bark is thin and smooth, often peeling in papery strips, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and barren landscapes."
