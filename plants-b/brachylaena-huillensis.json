    "intro": "Brachylaena huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n's brachylaena, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
