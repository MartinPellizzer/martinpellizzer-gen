    "intro": "Becium ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. Becium ericoides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
