    "intro": "Bromelia superba, commonly known as the royal bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers that can range in color from red to orange, often blooming in spring or summer. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and covered in a layer of fine hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Bromelia superba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
