    "intro": "Bouteloua media, commonly known as grama grass, is a native North American grass species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in dry, open habitats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and livestock forage. Its ecological importance is further highlighted by its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
