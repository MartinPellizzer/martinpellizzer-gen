It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the leaf. Botrychium decurrens is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rich, organic soil."
