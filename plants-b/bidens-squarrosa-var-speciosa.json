    "intro": "Bidens squarrosa var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough, bristly texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of three, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by attaching to the fur of animals or the clothing of humans, aiding in its spread across different environments."
