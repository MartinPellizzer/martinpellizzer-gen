    "intro": "Bellis validula, commonly known as the common daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces white flowers with yellow centers that bloom from spring to autumn. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Bellis validula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
