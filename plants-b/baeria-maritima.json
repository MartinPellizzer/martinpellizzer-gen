    "intro": "Baeria maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green leaves, which are adapted to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Baeria maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
