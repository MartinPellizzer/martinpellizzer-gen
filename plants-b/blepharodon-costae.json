    "intro": "Blepharodon costae, commonly known as the coastal blepharodon, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
