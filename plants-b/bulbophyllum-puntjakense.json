    "intro": "Bulbophyllum puntjakense, commonly known as the Puntjakense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant typically produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns on its petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
