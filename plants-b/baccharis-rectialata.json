    "intro": "Baccharis rectialata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Baccharis rectialata is drought-tolerant and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
