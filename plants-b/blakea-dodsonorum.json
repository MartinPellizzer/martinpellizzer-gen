    "intro": "Blakea dodsonorum, commonly known as the \"Carnival Blush\" or \"Dodson's Blakea,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and produces vibrant pink to red blooms. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, and it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
