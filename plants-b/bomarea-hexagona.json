It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, often violet or blue-colored flowers. The plant features tuberous roots and possesses a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, showy flowers. Bomarea hexagona is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
