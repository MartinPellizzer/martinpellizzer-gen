    "intro": "Bromus ramosus f. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-branched brome, is a variant of the tall brome species, characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter inflorescence. It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, spike-like arrangement of flowering structures. Its florets are usually pale green to yellowish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This form is notable for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
