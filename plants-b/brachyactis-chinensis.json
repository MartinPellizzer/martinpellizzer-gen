    "intro": "Brachyactis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese short-lived plant, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its short lifespan and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
