    "intro": "Briza fusca, commonly known as the common beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, hair-like leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, greenish-brown flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Briza fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
