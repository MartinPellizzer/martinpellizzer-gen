    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow and pointed. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
