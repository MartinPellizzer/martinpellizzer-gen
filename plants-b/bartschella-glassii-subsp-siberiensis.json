    "intro": "Bartschella glassii subsp. siberiensis, commonly known as the Siberian glassy bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
