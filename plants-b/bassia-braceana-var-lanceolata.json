    "intro": "Bassia braceana var. lanceolata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with fleshy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
