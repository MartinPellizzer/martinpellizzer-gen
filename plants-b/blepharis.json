    "intro": "Blepharis, commonly known as the \"lion's tail,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to southern Africa, with some species also found in Australia and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky, and often hairy foliage, which gives them their common name. They typically produce showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Blepharis species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
