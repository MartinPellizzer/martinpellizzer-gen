It produces striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small, intricate lanterns. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
