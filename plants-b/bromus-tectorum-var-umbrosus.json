    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. umbrosus, commonly known as the dark bromegrass, is a variant of the cheatgrass species native to the western United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dark green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
