    "intro": "Bermudiana scabra, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it highly invasive in many environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and withstand drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds, facilitating its spread through wind and water. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop, though it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
