    "intro": "Bulbophyllum onivense, commonly known as the Rainforest Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers are often short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in rainforest ecosystems."
