    "intro": "Baccharoides incompta, commonly known as the sand cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in restoration projects along coastal areas."
