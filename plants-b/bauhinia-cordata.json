It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its bark is smooth and greyish, while its wood is hard and durable. Bauhinia cordata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display."
