    "intro": "Bulbine tortifolia, commonly known as the woolly bulbine, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its textured foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
