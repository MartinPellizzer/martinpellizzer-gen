    "intro": "Barkhausia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a hardy shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Barkhausia stricta is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
