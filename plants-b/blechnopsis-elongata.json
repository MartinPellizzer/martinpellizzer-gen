    "intro": "Blechnopsis elongata, commonly known as the longleaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow, and often arching fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, elongated shape that gives it its common name."
