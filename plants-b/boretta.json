    "intro": "Boretta, commonly known as the golden brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bright yellow-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. Boretta is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems and a valuable forage crop."
