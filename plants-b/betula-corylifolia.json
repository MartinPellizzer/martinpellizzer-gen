    "intro": "Betula corylifolia, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula corylifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils."
