    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sikapingense, commonly known as the Sikaping orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
