    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. guillonii, commonly known as the Guillon's biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
