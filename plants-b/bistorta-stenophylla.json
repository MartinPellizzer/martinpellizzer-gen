    "intro": "Bistorta stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like stems. The plant features upright, cylindrical stems that are covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Bistorta stenophylla is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
