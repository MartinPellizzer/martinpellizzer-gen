    "intro": "Batrachium aquatile subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered marsh bladder, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive bladder-like structures that form along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, velvety hair, which helps in water retention. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
