    "intro": "Banksia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by woody cone-like fruits containing seeds. Banksia cuneifolia is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
