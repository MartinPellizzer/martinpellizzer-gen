It produces a fragrant, resinous substance called benzoin, which is harvested from its bark and exuded from its trunk. The plant belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The resin has been used for centuries in perfumery, incense, and traditional medicine due to its aromatic and therapeutic properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
