    "intro": "Brunsvigia marginata, commonly known as the firecracker lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems with clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that resemble firecrackers, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a favorite among gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
