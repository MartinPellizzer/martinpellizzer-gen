    "intro": "Bromus pallens, commonly known as the pale brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus pallens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
