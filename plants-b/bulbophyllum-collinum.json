    "intro": "Bulbophyllum collinum, commonly known as the Collin's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in low-nutrient conditions. Bulbophyllum collinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
