    "intro": "Besleria incarnata, commonly known as the red-flowered gesneriad, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Besleria incarnata is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
