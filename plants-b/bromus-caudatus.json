    "intro": "Bromus caudatus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the top of its stems, which contain the small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Bromus caudatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
