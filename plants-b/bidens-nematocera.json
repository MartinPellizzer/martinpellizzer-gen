    "intro": "Bidens nematocera, commonly known as the hairy beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of two, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Bidens nematocera is a perennial herb that can spread aggressively through its seed production and root system."
