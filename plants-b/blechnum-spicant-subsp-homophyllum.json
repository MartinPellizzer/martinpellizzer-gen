    "intro": "Blechnum spicant subsp. homophyllum, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with closely spaced, toothed pinnae that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
