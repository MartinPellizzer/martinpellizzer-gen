    "intro": "Boisduvalia subulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf boisduvalia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, subulate (awl-shaped) leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Boisduvalia subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
