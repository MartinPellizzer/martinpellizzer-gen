    "intro": "Begonia peristegia, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which gives it its distinctive appearance. Begonia peristegia thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
