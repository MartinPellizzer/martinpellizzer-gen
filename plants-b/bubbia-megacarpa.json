It is characterized by its large, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, commonly known as the gourd family. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
