    "intro": "Bihai rutila, commonly known as the golden rutila, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of Central America. This plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, pale yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The flowers, which appear in late spring, are large and showy, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Bihai rutila thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal care."
