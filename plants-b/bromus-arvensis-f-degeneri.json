    "intro": "Bromus arvensis f. degeneri, commonly known as the degenerate field brome, is a variant of the field brome, a grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its reduced growth habit and smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form. This form is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas, where it thrives in open, sunny conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to colonize and persist in various habitats."
