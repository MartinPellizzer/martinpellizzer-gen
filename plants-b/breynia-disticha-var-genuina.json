    "intro": "Breynia disticha var. genuina, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a succulent shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Breynia disticha var. genuina is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
