    "intro": "Berberis laurina, commonly known as the golden flame or winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant has spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant seasonal color. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting it."
