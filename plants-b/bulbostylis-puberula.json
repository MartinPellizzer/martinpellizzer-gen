It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Bulbostylis puberula is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
