    "intro": "Brassica tuberosa, commonly known as the Indian mustard or turnip mustard, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of round, fleshy pods containing seeds. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, and it is often cultivated for its edible leaves and seeds. Brassica tuberosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
