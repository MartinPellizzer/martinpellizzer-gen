    "intro": "Boerhavia caespitosa, commonly known as redroot sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with branching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Boerhavia caespitosa is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
