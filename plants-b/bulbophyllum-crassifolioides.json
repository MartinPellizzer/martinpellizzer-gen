    "intro": "Bulbophyllum crassifolioides, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. Its rhizome system allows it to form clumps, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
