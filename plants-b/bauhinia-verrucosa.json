    "intro": "Bauhinia verrucosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, papery, and often velvety leaves that are typically bi-lobed or trifoliate. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, flat pods containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. Bauhinia verrucosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types makes it a resilient and adaptable species."
