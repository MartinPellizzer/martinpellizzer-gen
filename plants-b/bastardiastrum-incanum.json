    "intro": "Bastardiastrum incanum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. Bastardiastrum incanum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas."
