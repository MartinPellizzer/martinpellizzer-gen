    "intro": "Bassia spinosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Bassia spinosa is a hardy plant that plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
