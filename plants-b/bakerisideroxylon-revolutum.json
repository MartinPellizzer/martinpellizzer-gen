    "intro": "Bakerisideroxylon revolutum, commonly known as the African sand dollar tree, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits resembling sand dollars. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Bakerisideroxylon revolutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
