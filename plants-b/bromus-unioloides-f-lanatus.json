    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-white pubescence that gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical traits make it an important species in ecological studies and forage production."
