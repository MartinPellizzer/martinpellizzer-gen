    "intro": "Berberis montana var. typica, commonly known as the Alpine barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its bright yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
