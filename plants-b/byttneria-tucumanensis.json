    "intro": "Byttneria tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is known for its ability to produce latex, which has been historically used for rubber production. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
