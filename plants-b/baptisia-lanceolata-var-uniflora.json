    "intro": "Baptisia lanceolata var. uniflora, commonly known as the slender false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to lavender flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, contributing to its hardiness in various conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
