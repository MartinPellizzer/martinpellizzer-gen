It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and drought."
