It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, exhibiting a compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray."
