It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and is typically found in wetland habitats. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic environments. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. This variety is considered endangered due to habitat loss and degradation."
