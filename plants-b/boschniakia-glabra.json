    "intro": "Boschniakia glabra, commonly known as the naked lady or ghost orchid, is a unique orchid species native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its fleshy, tubular stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specialized habitat and slow growth, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
