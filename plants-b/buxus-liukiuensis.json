    "intro": "Buxus liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Buxaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers are followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buxus liukiuensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
