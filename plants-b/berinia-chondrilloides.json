    "intro": "Berinia chondrilloides, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
