    "intro": "Betula humilis var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamtschatska birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring slender, often multi-stemmed trunks with smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are oval to elliptic, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
