    "intro": "Byrsonima variabilis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces distinctive, woody pods containing seeds that are commercially harvested as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy, making it a significant component of the rainforest ecosystem. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting biodiversity."
