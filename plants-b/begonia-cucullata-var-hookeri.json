    "intro": "Begonia cucullata var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
