It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pyramid-shaped inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Bulga pyramidalis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for gardens with well-drained soil."
