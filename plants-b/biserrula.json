    "intro": "Biserrula, commonly known as biserrula oxyphylla, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is often used as a forage crop and in erosion control due to its hardy nature. Biserrula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid environments."
