    "intro": "Brunellia, commonly known as the \"Brazilian mahogany,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It comprises approximately 150 species, predominantly found in tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are typically evergreen trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Many species produce woody fruits that contain several seeds, and some are valued for their hard, durable wood. Brunellia species play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
