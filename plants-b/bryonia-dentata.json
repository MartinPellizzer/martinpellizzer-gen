    "intro": "Bryonia dentata, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and rough, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and have a distinctive toothed margin, contributing to its common name. Bryonia dentata is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
