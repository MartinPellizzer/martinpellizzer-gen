    "intro": "Bignonia quercus, commonly known as the oakleaf bignonia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that resemble oak leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange tubular flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Bignonia quercus is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
