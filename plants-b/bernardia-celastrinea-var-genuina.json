    "intro": "Bernardia celastrinea var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its striking, bright orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and turn yellow in the autumn before falling off. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is relatively rare and is considered a threatened plant due to habitat loss."
