    "intro": "Besseya oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be quite deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it contributes to ecological diversity."
