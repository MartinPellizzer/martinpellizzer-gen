    "intro": "Bulbophyllum machupicchuense, commonly known as the Machu Picchu orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with numerous fragrant flowers. The plant's pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with good air circulation, making it a popular choice for intermediate to warm climate orchid growers. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
