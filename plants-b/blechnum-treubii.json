    "intro": "Blechnum treubii, commonly known as the Treub's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
