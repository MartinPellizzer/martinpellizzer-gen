    "intro": "Betula fontinalis, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive exfoliating bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a pale yellow or reddish-brown inner bark. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. Betula fontinalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and streamside habitats."
