    "intro": "Biscutella laxa, commonly known as the slender biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has a distinctive, branched root system that is fibrous and somewhat resembles a biscuit in texture, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Biscutella laxa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
