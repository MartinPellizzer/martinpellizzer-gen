    "intro": "Betula rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive rhombic-shaped leaves that are doubly serrated. The bark is smooth and pale, with a peeling texture that reveals a yellowish inner layer. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in moist, temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
