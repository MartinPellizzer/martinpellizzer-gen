    "intro": "Bencomia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe fruit, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the island of Flores in Indonesia. It produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature, containing a single seed. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
