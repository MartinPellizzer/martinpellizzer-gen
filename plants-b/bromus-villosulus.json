    "intro": "Bromus villosulus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, with leaves that are hairy and sometimes bluish-green in appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of several spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed glumes. Bromus villosulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
