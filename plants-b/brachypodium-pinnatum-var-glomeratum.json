    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. glomeratum, commonly known as clustered false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
