    "intro": "Barringtonia rimata, commonly known as the Maluku candlewood, is a flowering plant native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is a medium-sized tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, lantern-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom at night and emit a sweet fragrance. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, cotton-like fiber. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in local communities."
