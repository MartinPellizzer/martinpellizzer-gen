    "intro": "Botrychium ramosum var. manshuricum, commonly known as the Manshurian moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are arranged in a unique, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This variant is native to eastern Russia and has limited distribution, making it a rare and specialized species."
