It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Boltonia occidentalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
