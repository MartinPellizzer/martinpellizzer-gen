    "intro": "Begonia hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display intricate patterns and a striking red or pink coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
