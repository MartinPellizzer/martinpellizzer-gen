    "intro": "Brassica nostalgica, commonly known as the melancholic mustard, is a flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded woodlands. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Brassica nostalgica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
