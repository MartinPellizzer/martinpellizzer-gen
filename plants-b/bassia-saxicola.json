    "intro": "Bassia saxicola, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Bassia saxicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
