    "intro": "Bignonia radicans, commonly known as the crossvine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green and emit a mild, sweet scent. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs and can grow up to 30 feet in length. Bignonia radicans is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a naturalizer along woodland edges."
