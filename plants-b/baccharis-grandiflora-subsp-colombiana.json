    "intro": "Baccharis grandiflora subsp. colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Colombia and parts of Venezuela. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. It has a woody stem and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
