    "intro": "Botrychium crenulatum, commonly known as the crenulate moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a wavy or scalloped edge. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a dense, club-like formation on the underside of its fronds. Botrychium crenulatum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a relatively small plant, usually growing to a height of less than 20 centimeters."
