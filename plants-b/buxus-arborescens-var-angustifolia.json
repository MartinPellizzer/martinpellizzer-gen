    "intro": "Buxus arborescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with a narrow, elongated shape. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges and topiaries due to its ability to be shaped easily. This variety is more cold-hardy than other boxwood species, making it suitable for a wider range of climates."
