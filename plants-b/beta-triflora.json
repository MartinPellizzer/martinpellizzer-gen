    "intro": "Beta triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Beta triflora thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
