    "intro": "Boehmeria hwaliensis, commonly known as Chinese hemp or wild hemp, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its soft, fibrous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fibrous stalks have been historically used for making textiles and paper. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
