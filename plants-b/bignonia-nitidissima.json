It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its stems are twining and can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, making it an aggressive grower.
