    "intro": "Baccharoides calvoana var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved baccharoides, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline and poorly drained soils, making it well-suited to coastal environments. The species is also notable for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in sandy habitats."
