    "intro": "Bassia luehmannii, commonly known as Luehmann's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is often found in coastal and inland desert habitats."
