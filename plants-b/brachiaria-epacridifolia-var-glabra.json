    "intro": "Brachiaria epacridifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth brachiaria, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other brachiaria species."
