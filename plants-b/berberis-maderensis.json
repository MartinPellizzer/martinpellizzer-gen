    "intro": "Berberis maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features upright, spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky environments. Its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife make it a popular choice for gardeners in mild climates."
