    "intro": "Buddleja paludicola, commonly known as the marsh buddleja, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in China. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers attract a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Buddleja paludicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
