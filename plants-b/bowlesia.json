    "intro": "Bowlesia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pale flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Bowlesia is known for its fragility and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
