It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive three-lobed, orange-colored fruit. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a creamy texture, though it contains seeds that are toxic when raw. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and culinary uses in its native region."
