    "intro": "Baccharis lepidota, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It has a woody stem and produces small, oval berries that are often consumed by birds. Baccharis lepidota is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
