    "intro": "Bouteloua pumila, commonly known as gray beardgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish-white bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in restoration projects and native plant gardens."
