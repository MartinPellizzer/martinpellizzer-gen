    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. laciniata, commonly known as the paper birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive white, peeling bark. It is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America and parts of Asia. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely serrated margins, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and it produces small, winged seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas."
