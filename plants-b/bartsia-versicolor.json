    "intro": "Bartsia versicolor, commonly known as the variable bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, opposite leaves that are often hairy, and its flowers are small, clustered in whorls, with petals that range in color from white to pink and purple. Bartsia versicolor is known for its variable flower colors, which contribute to its common name. It is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
