    "intro": "Baccharis \u00d7 australis nothosubsp. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
