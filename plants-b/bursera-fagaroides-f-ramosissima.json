    "intro": "Bursera fagaroides f. ramosissima, commonly known as the ramose bursera, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. It is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its aromatic resins, which have been used traditionally in various applications."
