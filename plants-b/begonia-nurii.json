    "intro": "Begonia nurii, commonly known as the Chinese begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to China. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage as much as its flowers."
