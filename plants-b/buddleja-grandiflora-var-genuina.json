    "intro": "Buddleja grandiflora var. genuina, commonly known as the common butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period from late spring to early autumn."
