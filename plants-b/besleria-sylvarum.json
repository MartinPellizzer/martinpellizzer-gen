    "intro": "Besleria sylvarum, commonly known as the forest besleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture adapted to retain moisture. Besleria sylvarum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
