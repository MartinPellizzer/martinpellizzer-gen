It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate stems and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments."
