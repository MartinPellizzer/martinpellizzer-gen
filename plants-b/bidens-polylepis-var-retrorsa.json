    "intro": "Bidens polylepis var. retrorsa, commonly known as the backward-facing ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
