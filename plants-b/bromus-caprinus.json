    "intro": "Bromus caprinus, commonly known as alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned lemmas. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Bromus caprinus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
