    "intro": "Blepharis dilatata, commonly known as the narrowleaf blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink to purple in color, bloom during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Blepharis dilatata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
