It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
