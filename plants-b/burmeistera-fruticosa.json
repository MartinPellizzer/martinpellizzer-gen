    "intro": "Burmeistera fruticosa, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the warmer seasons."
