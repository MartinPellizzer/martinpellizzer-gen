    "intro": "Boea multiflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy boea, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as a decorative plant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
