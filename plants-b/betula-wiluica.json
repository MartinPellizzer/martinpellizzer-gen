    "intro": "Betula wiluica, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula wiluica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks."
