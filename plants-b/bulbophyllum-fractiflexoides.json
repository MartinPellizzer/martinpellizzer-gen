It is a epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are long and narrow, often curving in a flexible manner, giving it its common name. The flowers are small and delicate, usually appearing in clusters and displaying a range of colors from white to pink."
