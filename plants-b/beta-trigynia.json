    "intro": "Beta trigynia, commonly known as the sea beet, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in salty, arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its roots are thick and succulent. Beta trigynia is adapted to thrive in saline soils and can tolerate high levels of salt spray. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and hardy nature."
