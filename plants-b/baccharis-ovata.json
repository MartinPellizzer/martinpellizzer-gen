    "intro": "Baccharis ovata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, and it produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis ovata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
