    "intro": "Baccharis retusa, commonly known as smooth baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the fall, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and woodland edges. Baccharis retusa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
