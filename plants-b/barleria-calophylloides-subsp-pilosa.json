It features lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
