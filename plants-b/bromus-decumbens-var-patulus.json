    "intro": "Bromus decumbens var. patulus, commonly known as the Patulostemmed Brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with thin, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to arid conditions with deep root systems."
