    "intro": "Beilschmiedia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by round, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
