    "intro": "Bellis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Bellis glandulosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
