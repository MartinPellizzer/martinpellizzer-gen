    "intro": "Berlinia brieyi, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
