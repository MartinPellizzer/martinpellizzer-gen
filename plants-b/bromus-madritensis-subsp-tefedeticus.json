    "intro": "Bromus madritensis subsp. tefedeticus, commonly known as the Spanish needle or red brome, is a grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in a range of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in Mediterranean regions."
