    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. rubens, commonly known as the red brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish-brown seed heads and coarse, hairy leaves. This plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and sagebrush steppe. It plays a significant role in the ecology of its native range, serving as forage for wildlife and livestock. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
