    "intro": "Baillonella pierriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
