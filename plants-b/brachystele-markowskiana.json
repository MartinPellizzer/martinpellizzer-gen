    "intro": "Brachystele markowskiana, commonly known as the small-stemmed staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of leathery, sword-shaped leaves that form a tight, water-holding structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for tropical terrariums and shaded gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
