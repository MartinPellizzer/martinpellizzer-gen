    "intro": "Bahia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bahia, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in dense clusters during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly and form dense vegetation."
