    "intro": "Bromus inermis subsp. australis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
