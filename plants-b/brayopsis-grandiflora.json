    "intro": "Brayopsis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant bracken fern, is a large, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Brayopsis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
