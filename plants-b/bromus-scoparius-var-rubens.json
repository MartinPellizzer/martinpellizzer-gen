    "intro": "Bromus scoparius var. rubens, commonly known as the red brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish-purple coloration in the inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other brome species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to reddish flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
