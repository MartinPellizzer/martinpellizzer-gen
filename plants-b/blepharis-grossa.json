    "intro": "Blepharis grossa, commonly known as the common blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 20 centimeters. Blepharis grossa is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
