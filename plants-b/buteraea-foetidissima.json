    "intro": "Buteraea foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, often foul-smelling flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain seeds. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its strong odor, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps protect it from grazing."
