    "intro": "Bletia pulchella, commonly known as the showy bletia, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is a terrestrial herb with erect, leafy stems and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring, with flowers ranging in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Bletia pulchella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
