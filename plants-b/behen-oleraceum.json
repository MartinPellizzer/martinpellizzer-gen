    "intro": "Behen oleraceum, commonly known as marsh cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily."
