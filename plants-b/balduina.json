It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their visual appeal and hardiness. Balduina is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
