    "intro": "Begonia ranaiensis, commonly known as the Ranai Island begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Ranai in the Philippines. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
