    "intro": "Boswellia frereana, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the dry regions of the Arabian Peninsula and northeastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense, fragrant resinous sap that exudes when the bark is incised. The plant belongs to the Burseraceae family and is closely related to other frankincense-producing species. Its resin, known as olibanum, has been used for centuries in religious and medicinal contexts. The tree thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall."
