    "intro": "Brocchinia hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's brocchinia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru. This plant is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the leaf rosette. Brocchinia hitchcockii is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
