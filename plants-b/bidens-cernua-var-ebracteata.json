    "intro": "Bidens cernua var. ebracteata, commonly known as the slender beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. It produces small, bracteate fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands."
