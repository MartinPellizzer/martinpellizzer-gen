It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spore-bearing leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are divided into three distinct lobes. Botrychium biternatum is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters."
