    "intro": "Begonia forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's begonia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and the flowers come in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a sought-after plant among horticulturists."
