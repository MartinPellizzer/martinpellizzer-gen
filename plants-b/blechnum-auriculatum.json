    "intro": "Blechnum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps retain moisture. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
