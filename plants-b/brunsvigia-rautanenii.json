It is characterized by its tall, spiky flower spikes that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, giving it its common name. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen and form a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for Mediterranean climates and xeriscaping."
