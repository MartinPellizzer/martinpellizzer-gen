It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Betonica officinalis var. incana has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
