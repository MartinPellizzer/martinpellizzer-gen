    "intro": "Bulbophyllum amplistigmaticum, commonly known as the broad-stigma orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. The plant produces multiple racemes of fragrant, showy flowers with intricate patterns on their petals and sepals. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, often with contrasting purple or red markings. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
