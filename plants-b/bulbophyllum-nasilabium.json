    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nasilabium, commonly known as the \"Lipless Orchid,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that lacks the typical nectar-producing structures found in many orchids. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
