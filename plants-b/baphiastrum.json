    "intro": "Baphiastrum, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Baphiastrum species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds."
