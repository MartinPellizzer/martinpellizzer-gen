It features fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it forms dense clumps. Its resilience and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
