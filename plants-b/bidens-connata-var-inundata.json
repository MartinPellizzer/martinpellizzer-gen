It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
