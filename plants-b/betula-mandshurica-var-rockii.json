    "intro": "Betula mandshurica var. rockii, commonly known as the Korean birch, is a deciduous tree native to northeastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
