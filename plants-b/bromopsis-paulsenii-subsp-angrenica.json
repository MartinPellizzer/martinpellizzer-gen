    "intro": "Bromopsis paulsenii subsp. angrenica, commonly known as the Angrenica bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Bromopsis paulsenii subsp. angrenica is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
