    "intro": "Bartsia verna, commonly known as spring bartsia, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features delicate, opposite leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stalks. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size, but they play a role in attracting pollinators like flies and beetles. Bartsia verna thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
