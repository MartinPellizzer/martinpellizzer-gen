    "intro": "Bernardia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is now rare due to overharvesting. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
