    "intro": "Buddleja cordata subsp. cordata, commonly known as the woolly false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It is often used in gardens for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
