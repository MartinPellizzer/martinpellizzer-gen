It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens fennica is often found in areas with poor to moderately fertile soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
