    "intro": "Buxus virens, commonly known as the evergreen boxwood, is a dense, slow-growing shrub native to western Europe. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, giving it a neat, compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Buxus virens is widely cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes due to its ability to be shaped into various forms. Its foliage is often used in topiary art, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
