    "intro": "Bassia krantzii, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils. Bassia krantzii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
