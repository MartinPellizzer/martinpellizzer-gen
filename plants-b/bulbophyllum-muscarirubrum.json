    "intro": "Bulbophyllum muscarirubrum, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins and its elongated, pendant-like inflorescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum muscarirubrum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
