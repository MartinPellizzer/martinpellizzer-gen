    "intro": "Bothriochloa saccharoides subsp. reevesii, commonly known as Reeves' sugarcane grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is notable for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals."
