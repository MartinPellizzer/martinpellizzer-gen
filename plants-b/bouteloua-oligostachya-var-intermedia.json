It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
