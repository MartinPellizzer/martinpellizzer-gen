    "intro": "Beera caespitosa, commonly known as the Indian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It forms dense, compact clumps with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and rocky soils. Beera caespitosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
