It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is distinguished by its ornamental, bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
