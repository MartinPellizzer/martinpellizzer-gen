    "intro": "Betula alba lusus carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian white birch, is a variant of the white birch species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored tissue beneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
