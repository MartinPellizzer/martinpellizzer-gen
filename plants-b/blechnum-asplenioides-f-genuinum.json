    "intro": "Blechnum asplenioides f. genuinum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in both natural and cultivated settings."
