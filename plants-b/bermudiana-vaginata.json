    "intro": "Bermudiana vaginata, commonly known as the Bermuda grass. It is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda and the southeastern United States. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively. Bermudiana vaginata is well adapted to warm climates and is often used in lawns and pastures due to its resilience and rapid growth."
