    "intro": "Betula ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's birch, is a species of birch native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, white bark that remains smooth throughout its life. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
