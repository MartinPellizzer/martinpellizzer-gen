It features slender, reddish stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Blutaparon vermiculare is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
