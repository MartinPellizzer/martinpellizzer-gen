    "intro": "Buxus megistophylla, commonly known as the giant boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its compact form and ability to be shaped into intricate topiaries. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
