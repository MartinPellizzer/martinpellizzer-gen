    "intro": "Betula incana var. angulata, commonly known as the angular birch, is a variant of the dwarf birch characterized by its distinctive angular leaf morphology. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. The plant features smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are small, ovate, and often have a serrated margin. It thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky soils, and is adapted to cold climates. Betula incana var. angulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna."
