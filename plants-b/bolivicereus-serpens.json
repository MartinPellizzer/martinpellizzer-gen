    "intro": "Bolivicereus serpens, commonly known as the serpentine cactus, is a species native to Bolivia and Argentina. It is a spineless cactus characterized by its long, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. Bolivicereus serpens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
