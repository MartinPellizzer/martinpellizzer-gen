    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. tenuis, commonly known as Japanese brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
