    "intro": "Betula lenta var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf paper birch, is a variant of the sweet birch species native to the northeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a doubly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is often found in moist, acidic soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
