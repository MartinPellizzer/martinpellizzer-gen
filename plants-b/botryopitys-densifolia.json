    "intro": "Botryopitys densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Botryopitys densifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
