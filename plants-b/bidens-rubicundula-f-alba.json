    "intro": "Bidens rubicundula f. alba, commonly known as white bidens, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces yellow flowers with white markings, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The white variant of this species is distinguished by its pale floral markings, setting it apart from the more commonly seen red-flowered form."
