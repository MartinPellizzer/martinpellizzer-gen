    "intro": "Balanophora subglobosa, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other vegetation. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in a globular shape, giving it its common name. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
