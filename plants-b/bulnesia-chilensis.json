    "intro": "Bulnesia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southern Chile and western Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
