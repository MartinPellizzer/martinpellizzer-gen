    "intro": "Bustillosia, commonly known as the Mexican goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Bustillosia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
