    "intro": "Betula pumila var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth paper birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
