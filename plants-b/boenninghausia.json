    "intro": "Boenninghausia, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Boenninghausia species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
