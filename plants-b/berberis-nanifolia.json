    "intro": "Berberis nanifolia, commonly known as dwarf barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal color changes."
