    "intro": "Bombax insulare, commonly known as the Bahamian cotton tree, is a tropical deciduous tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling cotton-like bracts. The plant has smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces capsule fruits that split open to release seeds with tufts of silky hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
