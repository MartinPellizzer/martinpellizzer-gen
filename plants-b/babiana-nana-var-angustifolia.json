It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants."
