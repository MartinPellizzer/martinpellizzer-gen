    "intro": "Bruguiera \u00d7 hainesii, commonly known as the mangrove hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Bruguiera gymnorhiza and Bruguiera sexangula. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in coastal saline environments, particularly in mangrove forests. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including salt tolerance and the ability to absorb water through its pneumatophores. Its root system helps stabilize coastal sediments, playing a vital role in shoreline protection. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where mangrove ecosystems are present."
