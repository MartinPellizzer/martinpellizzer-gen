    "intro": "Berteroa incana f. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy goosefoot, is a variant of the species Berteroa incana, belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and succulent stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of North America. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
