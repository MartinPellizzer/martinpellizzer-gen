    "intro": "Bufonia macrosperma var. paniculata, commonly known as the paniculate bufonia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in panicles. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna or woodland habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems and potential use in traditional medicine."
