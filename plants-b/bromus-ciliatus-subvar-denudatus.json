    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus subvar. denudatus, commonly known as the naked leaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless leaves and spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
