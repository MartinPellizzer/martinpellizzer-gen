    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are triangular with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks."
