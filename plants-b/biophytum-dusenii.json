    "intro": "Biophytum dusenii, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or containers. Its low-growing habit and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
