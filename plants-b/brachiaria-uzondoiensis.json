    "intro": "Brachiaria uzondoiensis, commonly known as the African grass or African brachiaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Brachiaria uzondoiensis is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is often used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and resilience."
