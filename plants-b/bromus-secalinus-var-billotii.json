    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. billotii, commonly known as the billotii brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological significance and potential for use in restoration projects."
