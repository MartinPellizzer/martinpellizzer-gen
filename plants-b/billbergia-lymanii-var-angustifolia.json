    "intro": "Billbergia lymanii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height, giving it a tall, elegant appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual element to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
