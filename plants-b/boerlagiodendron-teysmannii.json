    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron teysmannii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
