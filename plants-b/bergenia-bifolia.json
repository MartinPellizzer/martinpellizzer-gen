    "intro": "Bergenia bifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bergenia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, upright stems. Bergenia bifolia is often found in rocky or shaded environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
