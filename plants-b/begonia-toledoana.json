    "intro": "Begonia toledoana, commonly known as the Toledo begonia, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its moist, shaded environment. Begonia toledoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
