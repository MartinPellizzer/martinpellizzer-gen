It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring fleshy, elongated pseudobulbs covered in a layer of dark, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical study."
