    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. congestus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically found at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, disturbed soils. This grass is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
