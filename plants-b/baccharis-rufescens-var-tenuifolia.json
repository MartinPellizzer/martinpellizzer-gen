    "intro": "Baccharis rufescens var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
