    "intro": "Bignonia glaberrima, commonly known as the rough bignonia, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by long, slender pods that contain several seeds. Bignonia glaberrima is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is adapted to thrive in partial shade."
