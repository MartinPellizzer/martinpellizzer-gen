    "intro": "Brickellia sonorana, commonly known as Sonoran brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert scrub and grasslands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia sonorana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
