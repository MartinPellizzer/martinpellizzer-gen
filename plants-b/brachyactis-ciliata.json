    "intro": "Brachyactis ciliata, commonly known as the curly-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are often curled at the edges. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated seed head with white, feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Brachyactis ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
