The plant produces spikelets that are often reddish in color, which can be an identifying feature. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and along roadsides. Bromus phoenix is an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
