    "intro": "Bixa orellana var. urucurana, commonly known as the \"urucu\" or \"barbatiman,\" is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright orange flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces a unique red-orange seed-containing capsule, which is the source of the orange-red dye known as annatto. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This variety is particularly valued for its vibrant color and versatility in both culinary and industrial applications."
