    "intro": "Bacopa lecomtei, commonly known as Lecomte's water hyssop, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. The plant is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Bacopa lecomtei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shallow water or along the edges of streams and ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
