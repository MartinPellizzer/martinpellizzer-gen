    "intro": "Butonica inclyta, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Butonica inclyta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
