    "intro": "Burmannia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran burmannia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burmanniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and fleshy, often reddish leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects. Burmannia sumatrana is also noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a common trait among many epiphytic plants."
