    "intro": "Brickellia linifolia, commonly known as threadleaf brickellia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Brickellia linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
