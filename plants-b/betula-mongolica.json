    "intro": "Betula mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white or silver-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
