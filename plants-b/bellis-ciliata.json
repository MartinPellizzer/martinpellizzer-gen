It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive ciliate (frayed) edge, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically yellow with a white or pink center, blooming in early spring. Bellis ciliata is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
