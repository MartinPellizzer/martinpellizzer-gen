    "intro": "Bosmania membranacea, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are often covered in a fine, membranous sheath. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets. Bosmania membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
