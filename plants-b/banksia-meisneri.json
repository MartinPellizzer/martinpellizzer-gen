    "intro": "Banksia meisneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody cone-like structures persist on the plant for many years, providing habitat for various wildlife. Banksia meisneri is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
