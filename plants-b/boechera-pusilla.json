    "intro": "Boechera pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Boechera pusilla is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
