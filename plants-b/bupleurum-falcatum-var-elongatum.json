    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the longleaf bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported tonic and antispasmodic properties."
