    "intro": "Biophytum sensitivum var. candolleanum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
