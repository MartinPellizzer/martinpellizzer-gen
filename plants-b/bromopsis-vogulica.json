    "intro": "Bromopsis vogulica, commonly known as the Vogulian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, typically found in tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Bromopsis vogulica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
