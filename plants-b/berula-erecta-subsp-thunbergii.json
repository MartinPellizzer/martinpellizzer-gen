    "intro": "Berula erecta subsp. thunbergii, commonly known as Thunberg's upright waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in aquatic environments. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic life."
