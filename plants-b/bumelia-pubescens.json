    "intro": "Bumelia pubescens, commonly known as the downy bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically green when mature and turn brown as they ripen. Bumelia pubescens is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
