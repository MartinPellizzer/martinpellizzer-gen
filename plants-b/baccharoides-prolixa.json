It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.

Baccharoides prolixa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
