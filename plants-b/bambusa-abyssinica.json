    "intro": "Bambusa abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian bamboo, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to Ethiopia. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a smooth, green surface. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the top of the culms. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Bambusa abyssinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional construction and as a source of sustainable materials."
