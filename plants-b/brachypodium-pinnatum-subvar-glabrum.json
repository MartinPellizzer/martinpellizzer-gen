    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth jointed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
