    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana var. ircutensis, commonly known as the Irkutsk feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental grass."
