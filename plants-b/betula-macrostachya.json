    "intro": "Betula macrostachya, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a salmon-colored inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically male, while the female flowers are small and clustered. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula macrostachya is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions."
