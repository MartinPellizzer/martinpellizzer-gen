It features hairy, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a valuable forage crop and a common weed in agricultural fields. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
