    "intro": "Bistorta rubra, commonly known as red bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, rhizomatous stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Bistorta rubra thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
