    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ustulatum, commonly known as the fire-stick orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often brightly colored flowers that resemble fire sticks or torches. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers typically bloom in summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps."
