    "intro": "Bolusiella iridifolia subsp. picea, commonly known as the purple-leafed ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green to purple leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its woody stems are thick and gnarled, providing structural support and contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
