It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves that are typically green and smooth in texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
