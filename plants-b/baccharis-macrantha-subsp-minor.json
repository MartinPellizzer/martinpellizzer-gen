    "intro": "Baccharis macrantha subsp. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for use in xeriscaping."
