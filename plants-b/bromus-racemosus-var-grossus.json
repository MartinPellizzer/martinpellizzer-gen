    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. grossus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often clustered in racemes. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, and it flowers in late summer to early fall. This grass is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along roadsides."
