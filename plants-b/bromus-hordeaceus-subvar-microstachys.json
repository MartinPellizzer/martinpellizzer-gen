    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus subvar. microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
