    "intro": "Bryonia scrobiculata, commonly known as the rough bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating, while its stems are hairy and often branched. Bryonia scrobiculata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
