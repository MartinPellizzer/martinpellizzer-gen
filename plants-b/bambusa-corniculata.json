    "intro": "Bambusa corniculata, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a distinctive golden hue to its foliage. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a V-shaped pattern along the stems. Bambusa corniculata is a clumping bamboo, forming dense clusters rather than spreading aggressively. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping and as a decorative plant in gardens."
