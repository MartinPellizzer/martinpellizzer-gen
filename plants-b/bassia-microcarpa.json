    "intro": "Bassia microcarpa, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Bassia microcarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
