    "intro": "Bertauxia, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a subtle silvery sheen. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Bertauxia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify the air in indoor settings."
