    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rugosum, commonly known as the rugged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, rugged appearance, with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
