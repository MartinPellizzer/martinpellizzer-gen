    "intro": "Beringeria mollissima, commonly known as the white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree can grow to impressive heights, often reaching over 50 meters in the wild. Its cones are small and typically contain two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The wood of Beringeria mollissima is valued for its strength and durability, making it a historically significant resource for indigenous peoples and early settlers."
