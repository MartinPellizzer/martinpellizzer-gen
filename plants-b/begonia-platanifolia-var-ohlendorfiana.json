It originates from the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight.
