    "intro": "Begonia franconis, commonly known as the Franconian begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia franconis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor environments."
