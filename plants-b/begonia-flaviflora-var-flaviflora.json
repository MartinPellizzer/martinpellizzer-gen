It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from both its striking foliage and showy blooms."
