    "intro": "Bidens scandens, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its showy yellow flowers, which appear in clusters, are accompanied by bracts that are often mistaken for petals. Bidens scandens is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
