    "intro": "Bulbophyllum polygaliflorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is often protected in its native regions."
