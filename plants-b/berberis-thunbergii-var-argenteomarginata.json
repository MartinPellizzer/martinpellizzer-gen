It features compound leaves with a dark green central portion and distinctive white or silver margins that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, posing a challenge to native plant ecosystems."
