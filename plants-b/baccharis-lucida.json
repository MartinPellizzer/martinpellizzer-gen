    "intro": "Baccharis lucida, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white to grayish seed heads. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Baccharis lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
