    "intro": "Begonia erminea var. obtusa, commonly known as the woolly begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
