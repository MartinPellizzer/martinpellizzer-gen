    "intro": "Begonia susaniae, commonly known as the Susania begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
