    "intro": "Bouteloua eriostachya, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. This perennial grass is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its drought tolerance and ecological resilience make it a valuable component of native plant communities."
