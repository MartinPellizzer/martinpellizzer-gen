    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum subsp. glaucovirens, commonly known as the silvergrass or glaucous bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of a waxy cuticle. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
