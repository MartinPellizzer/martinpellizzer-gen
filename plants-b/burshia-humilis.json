    "intro": "Burshia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf burshia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Burshia humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
