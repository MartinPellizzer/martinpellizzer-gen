    "intro": "Baptisia elliptica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flower spikes in late spring to early summer. The leaves are palmately divided into 5-7 narrow, lance-shaped lobes, and the plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens. This variety is noted for its hairy texture on both stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
