    "intro": "Bowdichia densiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or Brazilian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is being studied for its potential in reforestation efforts."
