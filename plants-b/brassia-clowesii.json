    "intro": "Brassia clowesii, commonly known as the Cattleya orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, warm environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-light conditions. Brassia clowesii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
