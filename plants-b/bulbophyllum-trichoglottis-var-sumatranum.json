    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trichoglottis var. sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that can range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which is a common adaptation in epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively manageable care requirements."
