    "intro": "Byronia, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes. Their leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the bark can be smooth or fissured depending on the species. Byronia species are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
