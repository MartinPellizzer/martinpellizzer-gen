    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to southern France and parts of Italy. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a low-growing plant with a compact rosette structure, and its fruits are pods that release seeds when mature. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
