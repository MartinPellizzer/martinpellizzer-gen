    "intro": "Boscia coriacea, commonly known as the rough boschia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Boscia coriacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
