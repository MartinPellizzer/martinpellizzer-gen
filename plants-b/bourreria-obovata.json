    "intro": "Bourreria obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed burr bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its obovate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
