    "intro": "Bauhinia nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are compound and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia nicobarica is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
