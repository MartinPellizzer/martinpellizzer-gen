    "intro": "Bursera trifoliolata, commonly known as the Mexican flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange or red berry-like fruits. Its latex is milky and can be used in traditional medicine. Bursera trifoliolata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
