    "intro": "Biscutella montana, commonly known as the mountain biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Himalayas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is distinctive, with thick, fleshy roots that store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. Biscutella montana is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
