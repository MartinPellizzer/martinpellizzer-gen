    "intro": "Benevidesia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-colored blossoms that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, reflecting its ability to thrive in drought conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the rocky soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
