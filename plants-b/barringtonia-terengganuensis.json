It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that resemble umbrellas. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Its fruit is a hard, spiny capsule that contains several edible seeds, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans. The tree is valued for its ornamental appearance and is also used in traditional medicine."
