    "intro": "Brexia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny broom. It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Brexia spinosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
