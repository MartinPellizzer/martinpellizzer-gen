It features a basal rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant grows up to 30 cm in height and blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
