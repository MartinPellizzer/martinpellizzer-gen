    "intro": "Bougainvillea \u00d7 buttiana, commonly known as the 'Pink Blush' bougainvillea, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Bougainvillea spectabilis and Bougainvillea peruviana. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that range from pink to red, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant is native to Brazil and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening, hedges, and as a flowering shrub in landscaped areas."
