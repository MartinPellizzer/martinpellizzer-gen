    "intro": "Banksia concreta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Banksia concreta has tough, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
