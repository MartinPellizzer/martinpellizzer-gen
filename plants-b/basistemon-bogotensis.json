It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests or grasslands. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
