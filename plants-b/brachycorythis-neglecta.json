It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It is a perennial herb that often thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
