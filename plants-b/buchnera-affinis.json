It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. Buchnera affinis has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a food source for certain pollinators."
