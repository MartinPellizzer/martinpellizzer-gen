    "intro": "Biota orientalis var. dumosa, commonly known as the dense biota or the bushy biota, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates."
