    "intro": "Besleria grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a vibrant display of red, orange, and yellow hues that attract pollinators like bees and birds."
