    "intro": "Betula beeniana, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula beeniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
