    "intro": "Betula littelliana, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, grayish bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are typical of the Betula genus. This plant is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra and mountainous areas."
