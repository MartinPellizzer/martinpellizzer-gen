    "intro": "Borreria capitata, commonly known as the yellow cholla, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borreria capitata is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
