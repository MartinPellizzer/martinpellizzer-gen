It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, with a buttressed trunk and spreading branches. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release fibrous seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
