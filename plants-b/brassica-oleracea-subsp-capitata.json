It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is cultivated for its edible leaves, stem, and flower buds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has a rosette-forming habit. Its leaves are usually dark green, thick, and fleshy, with a slightly sour taste due to the presence of glucosinolates. This subspecies is widely grown in temperate regions for both fresh consumption and processing into various food products."
