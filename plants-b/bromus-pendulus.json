    "intro": "Bromus pendulus, commonly known as the weeping brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its drooping, pendulous inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus pendulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
