It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence of white or green flower buds that are harvested before they open. The plant is a biennial, though it is typically grown as an annual in temperate climates. Its leaves are thick and dark green, and it thrives in cool weather. Cauliflower requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil for optimal growth."
