It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale green flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically growing in wetland or marshy habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized species."
