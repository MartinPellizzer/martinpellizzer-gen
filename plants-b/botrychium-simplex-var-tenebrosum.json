    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. tenebrosum, commonly known as the dark fern or black fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique morphology. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is known for its distinctive fronds that are often dark green or almost black in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds, a feature that distinguishes it from other fern species. This variant is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions with suitable microhabitats."
