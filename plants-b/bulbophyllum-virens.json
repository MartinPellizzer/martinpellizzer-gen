    "intro": "Bulbophyllum virens, commonly known as the green bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
