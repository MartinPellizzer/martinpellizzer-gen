    "intro": "Butyrospermum paradoxum subsp. parkii, commonly known as shea tree or karite, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the savannas of West and Central Africa, where it thrives in tropical climates. The tree produces a valuable nut from which shea butter is extracted, used in cosmetics and food products. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is also important for its ecological role and economic value in local communities."
