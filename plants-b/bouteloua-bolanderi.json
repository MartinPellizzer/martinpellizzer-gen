    "intro": "Bouteloua bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has a clumping growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish tinge, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
