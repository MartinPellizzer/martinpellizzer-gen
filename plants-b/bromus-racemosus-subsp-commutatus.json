    "intro": "Bromus racemosus subsp. commutatus, commonly known as the clustered brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the seed heads are often loosely arranged. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
