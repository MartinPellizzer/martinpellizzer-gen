    "intro": "Bougainvillea stipitata var. fiebrigii, commonly known as the Cape coral, is a vibrant flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and white, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its showy appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with sprawling or upright stems depending on the variety and cultivation conditions."
