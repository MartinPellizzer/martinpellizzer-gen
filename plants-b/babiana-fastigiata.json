    "intro": "Babiana fastigiata, commonly known as the spike lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, spike-like inflorescences of white to pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Babiana fastigiata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
