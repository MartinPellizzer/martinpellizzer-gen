    "intro": "Benzoin populifolium, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or white benzoin, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by dark, leathery fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its resin, which has a sweet, balsamic fragrance, is harvested from the bark and used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The tree thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
