    "intro": "Boerhavia triquetra var. triquetra, commonly known as redroot sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Its stems and leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
