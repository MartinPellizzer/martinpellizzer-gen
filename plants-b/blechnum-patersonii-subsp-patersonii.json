    "intro": "Blechnum patersonii subsp. patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's hart's-tongue fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or folded. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
