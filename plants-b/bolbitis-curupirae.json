    "intro": "Bolbitis curupirae, commonly known as the Amazonian water fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Bolbitis curupirae plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life."
