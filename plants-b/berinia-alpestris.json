    "intro": "Berinia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Berinia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
