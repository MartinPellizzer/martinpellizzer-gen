    "intro": "Bromelia balansae var. tricolor, commonly known as the Trinidadian bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that displays three distinct colors, often red, yellow, and green, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant features rosettes of waxy, strap-like leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in bromeliads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
