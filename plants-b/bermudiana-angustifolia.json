    "intro": "Bermudiana angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
