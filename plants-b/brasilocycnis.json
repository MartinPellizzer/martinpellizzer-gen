    "intro": "Brasilocycnis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Brasilocycnis has small, fleshy roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
