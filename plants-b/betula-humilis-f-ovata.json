It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the typical species. The plant is native to northern Europe and is often found in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring and has a distinctive, gnarled appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
