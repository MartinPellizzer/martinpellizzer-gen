    "intro": "Bessera, commonly known as the golden bessera, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and inconspicuous flowers, often clustered in cyathia, a type of modified inflorescence. Bessera species typically produce yellow or orange fruits that are capsule-like in structure. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
