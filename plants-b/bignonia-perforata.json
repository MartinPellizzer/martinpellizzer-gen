The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically orange to red in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy glands, and it has a strong, woody vine structure. Bignonia perforata is often used in ornamental gardening but can be invasive in certain regions."
