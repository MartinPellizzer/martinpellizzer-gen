    "intro": "Blechnum longifolium var. fraxinea, commonly known as the Fraxineous maidenhair fern, is a variant of the long-leaf maidenhair fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. This fern thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light."
