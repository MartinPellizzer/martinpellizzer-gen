    "intro": "Bihai vellerigera, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its valuable timber and essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
