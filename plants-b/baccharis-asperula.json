It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically dispersed by birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Baccharis asperula is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in xeriscaping and as a wildlife plant."
