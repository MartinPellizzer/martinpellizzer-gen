    "intro": "Bromus aegyptiacus, commonly known as Egyptian brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Bromus aegyptiacus is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
