    "intro": "Blastemanthus gemmiflorus subsp. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's blastemanthus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or clay-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
