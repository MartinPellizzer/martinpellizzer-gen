    "intro": "Billbergia tweedieana var. latisepala, commonly known as the Broad-Sepaled Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dense, fibrous covering on the leaf surfaces. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
