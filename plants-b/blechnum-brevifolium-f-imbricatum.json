    "intro": "Blechnum brevifolium f. imbricatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a variant of the broadleaf holly fern. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically shorter and more densely arranged than those of the species. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
