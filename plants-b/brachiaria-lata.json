    "intro": "Brachiaria lata, commonly known as flatawn, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, spreading leaves and dense, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in open areas, including pastures and disturbed soils, and is well adapted to warm climates. Brachiaria lata is often used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, pale flowers that develop into seeds."
