    "intro": "Brachyglottis sinclairii var. pinnata, commonly known as the silver tufted dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a dandelion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and alpine regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations."
