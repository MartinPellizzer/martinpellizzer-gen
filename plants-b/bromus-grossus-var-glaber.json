It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in pastureland and for erosion control."
