    "intro": "Bridelia insulana var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked bridelia, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
