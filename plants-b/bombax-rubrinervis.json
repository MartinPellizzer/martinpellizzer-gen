    "intro": "Bombax rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous cotton-like seeds are encased in a fluffy, hairy capsule. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
