    "intro": "Betula tessingolica, commonly known as the Teshingola birch, is a species of birch native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
