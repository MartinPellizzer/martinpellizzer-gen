    "intro": "Bartholomaea mollis, commonly known as the soft bartholomaea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Bartholomaea mollis is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
