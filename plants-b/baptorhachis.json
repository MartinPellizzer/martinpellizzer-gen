    "intro": "Baptorhachis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Baptorhachis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopies of tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an endangered species."
