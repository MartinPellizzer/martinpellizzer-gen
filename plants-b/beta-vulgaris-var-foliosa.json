    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. foliosa, commonly known as leaf beet or spinach beet, is a cultivated variant of the beet plant. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are typically harvested before the root becomes fully developed. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is often grown for its edible leaves rather than its root. The leaves are rich in nutrients such as iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
