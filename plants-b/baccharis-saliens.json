It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and scrublands. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its resilience to coastal conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
