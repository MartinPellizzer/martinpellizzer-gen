    "intro": "Brickellia lemmonii var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
