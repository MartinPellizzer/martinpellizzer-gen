    "intro": "Blaeria spicata var. fakoensis, commonly known as the Fako spikebush, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in local horticulture for ornamental purposes."
