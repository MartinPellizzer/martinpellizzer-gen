    "intro": "Billardiera sericophora var. megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It has woody stems and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in groups of three. The leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from them. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in supporting native insect and bird populations."
