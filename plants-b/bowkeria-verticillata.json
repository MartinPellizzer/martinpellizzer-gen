    "intro": "Bowkeria verticillata, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and trail along supports. Bowkeria verticillata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
