It is characterized by its swollen, globe-shaped stem that serves as the edible part of the plant. The leaves are alternate, lobed, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which develop into pods containing round, dark green seeds. Kohlrabi is native to Europe and is cultivated for its crisp, nutritious stem."
