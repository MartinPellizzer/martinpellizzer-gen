    "intro": "Besseya alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Besseya alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
