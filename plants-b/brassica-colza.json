    "intro": "Brassica colza, commonly known as rapeseed, is an annual flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and western Asia but is now widely cultivated in temperate regions. The plant produces yellow flowers and oval-shaped pods containing round, yellow seeds. These seeds are the primary source of oil used in cooking and industrial applications. Brassica colza is also valued for its role in crop rotation and as a source of biofuel."
