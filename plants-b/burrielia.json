    "intro": "Burrielia, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, candle-like shape and bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Burrielia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
