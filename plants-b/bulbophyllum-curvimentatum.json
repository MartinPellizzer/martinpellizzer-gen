    "intro": "Bulbophyllum curvimentatum, commonly known as the curling lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, curling lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. The orchid's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat."
