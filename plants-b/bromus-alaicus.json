    "intro": "Bromus alaicus, commonly known as the Alaska brome, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, tundra, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it retain moisture in cold climates. Bromus alaicus is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic regions."
