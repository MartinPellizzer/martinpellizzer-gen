    "intro": "Bertya gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, broad leaves, and the production of a milky sap, which is a notable botanical feature. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments and is often found in scrub or thorn forest habitats. The flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellow or greenish hue, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
