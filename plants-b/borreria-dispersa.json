It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Borreria dispersa is often found in dry, disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soils. It is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
