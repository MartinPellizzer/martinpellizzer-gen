    "intro": "Berberis iberica var. paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian barberry, is a shrub native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
