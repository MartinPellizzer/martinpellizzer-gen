    "intro": "Billbergia wiotiana, commonly known as the Wioti Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts, often adorned with yellow and orange flowers. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Billbergia wiotiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
