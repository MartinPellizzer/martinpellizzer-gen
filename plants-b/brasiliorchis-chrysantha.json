    "intro": "Brasiliorchis chrysantha, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns and a distinct, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species within its native range."
