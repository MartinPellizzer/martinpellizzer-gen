    "intro": "Bursaria occidentalis, commonly known as the western burr bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, woody fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It is adapted to dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Bursaria occidentalis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
