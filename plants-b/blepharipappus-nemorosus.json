    "intro": "Blepharipappus nemorosus, commonly known as the woodland fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open woodlands and thrives in partial shade. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Blepharipappus nemorosus is often found in prairies and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
