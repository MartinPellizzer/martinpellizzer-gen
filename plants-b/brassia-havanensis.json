    "intro": "Brassia havanensis, commonly known as the Havana orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has erect, hairy stems and produces leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Brassia havanensis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
