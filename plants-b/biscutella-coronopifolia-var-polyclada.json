    "intro": "Biscutella coronopifolia var. polyclada, commonly known as the polyclad biscutella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or violet, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
