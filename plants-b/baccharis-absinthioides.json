    "intro": "Baccharis absinthioides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking contrast to its green stems and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early fall. Baccharis absinthioides is valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
