It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a dense, glandular coating on its stems and leaves, which gives it a sticky texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Buchnera viscosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
