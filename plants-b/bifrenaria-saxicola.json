    "intro": "Bifrenaria saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a thallus that is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lobed structure. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic association with algae and fungi for nutrition. Bifrenaria saxicola is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
