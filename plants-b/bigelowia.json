These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange inflorescences that resemble small suns. Native to the northern hemisphere, Bigelowia species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. They thrive in temperate climates and are known for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Bigelowia grandiflora being one of the most notable for its striking floral display."
