    "intro": "Brachypodium tenoreanum, commonly known as the rock bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium tenoreanum thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
