    "intro": "Banisteria cornifolia var. discolor, commonly known as the variegated coral tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and feature a distinctive variegation pattern with white or cream markings. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy appearance and adaptability to warm climates."
