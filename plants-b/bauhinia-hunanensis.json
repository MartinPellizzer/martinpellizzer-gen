    "intro": "Bauhinia hunanensis, commonly known as the Hunan bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, papery flowers that are typically pale pink or white, which bloom in spring. Bauhinia hunanensis is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy species suitable for arid regions. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant."
