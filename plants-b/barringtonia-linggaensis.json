    "intro": "Barringtonia linggaensis, commonly known as the Lingga lantern tree, is a tropical plant native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive white, lantern-like flowers that emit a strong fragrance, particularly at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, fibrous mesh. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local ecosystem of its native habitat."
