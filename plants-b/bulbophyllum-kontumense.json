    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kontumense, commonly known as the Kontum orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
