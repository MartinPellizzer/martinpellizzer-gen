It is characterized by its delicate, slender leaves that are often arranged in dense, clustered formations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Botrys leptophyllus has a compact growth habit and is often found in temperate regions. Its small, closely packed shoots make it a notable species for ecological studies in moist, woodland habitats."
