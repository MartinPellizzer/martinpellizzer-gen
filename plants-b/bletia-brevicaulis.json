    "intro": "Bletia brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its short, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often blooming in the spring or early summer. Bletia brevicaulis is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. Its botanical features make it a unique and attractive addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
