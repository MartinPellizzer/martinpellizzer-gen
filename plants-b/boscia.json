    "intro": "Boscia, commonly known as the sour fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their thick, often spiny bark and small, fleshy fruits. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. Boscia species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Their fruits, while not widely consumed by humans, are an important food source for various animals."
