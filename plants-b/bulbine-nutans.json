    "intro": "Bulbine nutans, commonly known as the nodding bulbine, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Bulbine nutans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
