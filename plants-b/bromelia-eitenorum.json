    "intro": "Bromelia eitenorum, commonly known as the Eiten's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant's foliage is typically bright green with a waxy texture, and its flowers are often vibrant red or orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Bromelia eitenorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique structure and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
