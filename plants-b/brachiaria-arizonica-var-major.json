    "intro": "Brachiaria arizonica var. major, commonly known as Arizona grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
