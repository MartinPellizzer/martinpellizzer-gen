    "intro": "Bulbophyllum salweenense, commonly known as the Salween Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
