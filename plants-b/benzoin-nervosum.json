    "intro": "Benzoin nervosum, commonly known as the sacred balm or sacred gum, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces fragrant resinous exudates from its bark and leaves. The plant's botanical features include smooth, grayish-brown bark with longitudinal fissures and lance-shaped leaves that are leathery in texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. The resin, known as benzoine, is used in traditional medicine and for its aromatic properties."
