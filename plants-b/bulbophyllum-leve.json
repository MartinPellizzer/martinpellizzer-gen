    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leve, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapting to low-light conditions in its native environment. Bulbophyllum leve is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
