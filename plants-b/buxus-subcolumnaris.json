    "intro": "Buxus subcolumnaris, commonly known as the columnar boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which makes it ideal for formal garden designs. The plant has small, dark green, glossy leaves that remain dense and uniform throughout the year. It is often used as a topiary or hedge plant due to its ability to maintain shape with regular pruning. Buxus subcolumnaris is relatively low maintenance but prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
