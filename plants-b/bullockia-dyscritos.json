    "intro": "Bullockia dyscritos, commonly known as the spiky sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal regions. It has a distinctive morphology characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus with a rough, spiky surface. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches to rocks or other substrates. Its reproductive structures are typically found on the upper surfaces of the thallus. Bullockia dyscritos plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
