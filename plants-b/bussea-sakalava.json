    "intro": "Bussea sakalava, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, almost impenetrable bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and tool-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Bussea sakalava is considered critically endangered."
