    "intro": "Bunchosia ternata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild coffee, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Bunchosia ternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
