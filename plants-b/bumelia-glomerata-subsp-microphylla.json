It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often white or pale green in color. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to other members of the Bumelia genus."
