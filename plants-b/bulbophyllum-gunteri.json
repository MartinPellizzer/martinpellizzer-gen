It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Bulbophyllum gunteri is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
