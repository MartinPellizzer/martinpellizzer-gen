    "intro": "Brassica campestris, commonly known as field mustard, is an annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and seed pods. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 cm, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lobed or serrated. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, round seeds in elongated pods. Field mustard is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
