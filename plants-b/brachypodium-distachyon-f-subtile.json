    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon f. subtile, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Botanically, it has a short stature, typically reaching heights of 10\u201330 cm, with spikelets that are closely arranged along the stem. Its genome has been studied for its use in plant biology research due to its genetic simplicity and rapid life cycle."
