    "intro": "Byttneria echinata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing small, hard seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its hard wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
