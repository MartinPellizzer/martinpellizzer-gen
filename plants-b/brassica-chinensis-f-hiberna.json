    "intro": "Brassica chinensis f. hiberna, commonly known as the winter Chinese cabbage, is a cool-season vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, compact leaves and a short, swollen stem that forms a head similar to that of napa cabbage. This variety is well adapted to colder climates and is typically harvested in late autumn or early winter. The plant is rich in nutrients, including vitamins A and C, and is valued for its mild, slightly sweet flavor. It is widely cultivated in temperate regions for both fresh consumption and storage."
