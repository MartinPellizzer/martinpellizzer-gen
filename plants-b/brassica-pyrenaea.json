    "intro": "Brassica pyrenaea, commonly known as the alpine cabbage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. This plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
