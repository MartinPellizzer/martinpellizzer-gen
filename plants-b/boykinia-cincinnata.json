    "intro": "Boykinia cincinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockfoxfur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
