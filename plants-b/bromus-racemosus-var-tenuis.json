    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Bromus racemosus var. tenuis is often found in grassland ecosystems and is adapted to seasonal fluctuations in moisture and temperature."
