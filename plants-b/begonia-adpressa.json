    "intro": "Begonia adpressa, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
