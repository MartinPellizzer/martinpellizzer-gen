It is native to East Asia and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its fibrous stalks, which have been historically used for textile production. Boehmeria candidissima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.
