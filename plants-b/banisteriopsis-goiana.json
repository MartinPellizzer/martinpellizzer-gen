    "intro": "Banisteriopsis goiana, commonly known as the \"sangre de drago\" or dragon's blood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in shaded environments contributes to its role in forest ecosystems."
