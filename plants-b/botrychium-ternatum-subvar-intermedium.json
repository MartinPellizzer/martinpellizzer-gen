    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum subvar. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing leaves called sporophytes, which are distinctive for their clustered, knob-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
