    "intro": "Bauhinia pottsii var. elongata, commonly known as the longpod bauhinia, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pods that hang from the plant, often displaying a vibrant red or orange hue. The plant features bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
