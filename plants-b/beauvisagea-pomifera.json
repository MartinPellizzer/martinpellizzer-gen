It is characterized by its large, showy, apple-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, pale green bark that becomes more reddish with age. Its leaves are broad, oval, and have a waxy texture, often with a slight pubescence. The fruit, though not commonly consumed, is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds."
