    "intro": "Bidens heterophylla, commonly known as the variable beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, often hairy leaves that vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens heterophylla is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including roadsides and fields."
