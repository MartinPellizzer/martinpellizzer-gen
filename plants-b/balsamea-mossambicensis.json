It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a delicate, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, leaf-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. This moss is native to southern Africa and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
