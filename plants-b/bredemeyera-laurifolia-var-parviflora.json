It is a compact evergreen fern characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant features small, delicate, white to pale yellow spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden landscapes."
