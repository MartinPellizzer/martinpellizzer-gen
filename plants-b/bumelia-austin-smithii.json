It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
