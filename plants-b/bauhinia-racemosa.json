    "intro": "Bauhinia racemosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia racemosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also contributes to soil fertility."
