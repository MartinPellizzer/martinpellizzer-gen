It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in dry, tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and small, simple leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are followed by small, spiky fruits containing seeds. Bursera velutina is also valued for its latex, which has been used traditionally in various applications."
