It is characterized by its large, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
