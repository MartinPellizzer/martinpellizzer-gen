    "intro": "Bromus pseudosecalinus subsp. fallacinus, commonly known as the fall annual bromegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its annual life cycle, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in groups of three, with small, awned flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
