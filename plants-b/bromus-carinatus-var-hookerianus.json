    "intro": "Bromus carinatus var. hookerianus, commonly known as Hooker's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted culms with dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, grass-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
