    "intro": "Bulbophyllum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its bulb-like structures, which store water and nutrients, are a key feature of its survival in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
