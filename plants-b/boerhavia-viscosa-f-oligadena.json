    "intro": "Boerhavia viscosa f. oligadena, commonly known as the woolly blite, is a succulent perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with fleshy, pale green to blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The variety f. oligadena is distinguished by its more densely hairy leaves compared to the typical form."
