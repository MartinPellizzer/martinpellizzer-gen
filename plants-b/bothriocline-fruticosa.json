    "intro": "Bothriocline fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Bothriocline fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
