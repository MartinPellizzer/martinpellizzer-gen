    "intro": "Brugmansia arborea, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, pink, and orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its bark is thick and often fissured. Brugmansia arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
