    "intro": "Begonia gracilis var. membranacea, commonly known as the slender begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink or red, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container displays."
