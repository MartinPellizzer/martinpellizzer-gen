    "intro": "Brachystelma rangacharii, commonly known as the Rangachari's stone orchid, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and has adapted to arid environments with its compact growth form. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it store water, while its roots are shallow and spread out to maximize water absorption. This species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
