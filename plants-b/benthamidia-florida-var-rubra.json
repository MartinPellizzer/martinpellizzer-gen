    "intro": "Benthamidia florida var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered benthamidia, is a striking species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals that contrast with its green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a cluster of small, showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The variety 'rubra' is distinguished by its intense red coloration, which sets it apart from other variants of the species."
