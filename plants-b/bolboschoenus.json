    "intro": "Bolboschoenus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and peat bogs, where they form dense tussocks. Bolboschoenus species are characterized by their upright, grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, strap-shaped leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually inconspicuous, and they play an important role in stabilizing wetland soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to thrive in saturated conditions."
