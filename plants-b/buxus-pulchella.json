    "intro": "Buxus pulchella, commonly known as the silver leaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often has a slight silver or grayish hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its slow growth rate and tolerance to pruning make it a favored plant in formal garden designs."
