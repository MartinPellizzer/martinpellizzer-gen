    "intro": "Buphthalmum arvense, commonly known as the field dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Buphthalmum arvense typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and fields. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, making it easily identifiable in the wild."
