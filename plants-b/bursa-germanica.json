    "intro": "Bursa germanica, commonly known as the German bur or German thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant features spiny, bract-like structures that form a prickly covering around its flower heads, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Bursa germanica is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
