    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. simplicissimus, commonly known as the simple bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens."
