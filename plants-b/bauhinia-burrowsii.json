    "intro": "Bauhinia burrowsii, commonly known as the Burrows's bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
