    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp. sylvaticum, commonly known as the wood bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its fibrous root system and adaptability make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
