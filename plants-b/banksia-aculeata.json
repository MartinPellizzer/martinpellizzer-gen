    "intro": "Banksia aculeata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia aculeata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species."
