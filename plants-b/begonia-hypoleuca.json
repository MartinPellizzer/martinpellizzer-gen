    "intro": "Begonia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia hypoleuca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic foliage and ease of care."
