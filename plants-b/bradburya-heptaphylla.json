    "intro": "Bradburya heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leafed bradburya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bradburya heptaphylla is considered endangered in its native range."
