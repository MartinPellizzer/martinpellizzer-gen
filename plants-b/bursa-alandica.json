    "intro": "Bursa alandica, commonly known as the Alandica bur. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. The plant features small, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bursa alandica typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
