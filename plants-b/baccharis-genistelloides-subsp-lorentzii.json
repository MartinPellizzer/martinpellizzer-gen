    "intro": "Baccharis genistelloides subsp. lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, adapting to arid and semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are generally narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
