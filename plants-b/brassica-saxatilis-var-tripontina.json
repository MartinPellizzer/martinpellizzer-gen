It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
