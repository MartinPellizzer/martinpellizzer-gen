    "intro": "Banksia corvijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals and fire. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of wax, and it is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Banksia corvijuga plays an important ecological role in providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
