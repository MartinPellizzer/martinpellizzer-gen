    "intro": "Betula obovata, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to obovate in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to temperate climates."
