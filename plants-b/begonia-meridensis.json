    "intro": "Begonia meridensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
