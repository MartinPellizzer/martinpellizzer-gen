    "intro": "Benzoina vera, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or styrax, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, resinous sap that exudes when the bark is wounded. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its resin, known as benzoin, has been used for centuries in perfumery, incense, and traditional medicine. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
