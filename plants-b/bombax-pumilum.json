    "intro": "Bombax pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf cotton tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are palmately lobed. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
