    "intro": "Biota orientalis f. sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
