It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous short, bristly lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is adapted to thrive in arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
