    "intro": "Bealia speciosa, commonly known as the showy bealia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Bealia speciosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
