    "intro": "Brassia dresslerorum, commonly known as the Dressler's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and bloom during the wet season. The genus Brassia is known for its complex hybridization, making Brassia dresslerorum a popular subject in horticultural research and cultivation."
