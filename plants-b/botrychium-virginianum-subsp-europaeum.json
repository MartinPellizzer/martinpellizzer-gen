    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum subsp. europaeum, commonly known as the European moonwort, is a small, delicate fern-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique fronds that resemble a cluster of small, green, shield-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
