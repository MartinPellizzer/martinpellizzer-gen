    "intro": "Buxus mollicula, commonly known as the velvet boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are slightly hairy beneath, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Buxus mollicula is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
