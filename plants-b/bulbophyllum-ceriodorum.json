    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ceriodorum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, red-tipped pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a deep red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum ceriodorum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
