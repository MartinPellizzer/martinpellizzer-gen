    "intro": "Brandisia, commonly known as the \"flowering fig tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It consists of about 150 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. They produce non-edible fruits that are often enclosed in a fleshy, fig-like structure. Brandisia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
