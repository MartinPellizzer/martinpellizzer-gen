It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-ranked spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
