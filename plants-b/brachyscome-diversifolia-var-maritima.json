    "intro": "Brachyscome diversifolia var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, surrounded by white to pale green bracts. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
