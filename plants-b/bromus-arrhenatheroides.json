    "intro": "Bromus arrhenatheroides, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are usually yellow-green in color. Bromus arrhenatheroides is known for its adaptability and can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
