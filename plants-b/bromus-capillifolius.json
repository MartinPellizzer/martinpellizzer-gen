    "intro": "Bromus capillifolius, commonly known as slender brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in temperate climates. Bromus capillifolius is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
