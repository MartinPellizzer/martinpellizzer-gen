    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pavimentatum, commonly known as the pavement orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a spike-like arrangement, with intricate patterns on the petals. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
