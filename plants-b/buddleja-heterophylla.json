    "intro": "Buddleja heterophylla, commonly known as the woolly buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It features striking, fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces long, terminal clusters of pale blue to purple tubular flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions."
