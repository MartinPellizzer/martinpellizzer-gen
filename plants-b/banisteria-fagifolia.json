    "intro": "Banisteria fagifolia, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a day, which makes it a fleeting but striking addition to botanical gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant floral displays."
