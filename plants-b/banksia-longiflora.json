    "intro": "Banksia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered banksia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody structure and its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Banksia longiflora is also valued for its ecological role and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
