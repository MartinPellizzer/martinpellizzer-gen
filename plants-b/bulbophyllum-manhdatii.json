    "intro": "Bulbophyllum manhdatii, commonly known as the Manhdati orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of yellow and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
