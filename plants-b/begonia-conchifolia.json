    "intro": "Begonia conchifolia, commonly known as the coral begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves that often display intricate patterns and a range of colors, including pink, red, and purple. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with a unique, coral-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia conchifolia is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
