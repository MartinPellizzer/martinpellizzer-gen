    "intro": "Brassica cretica var. nivea, commonly known as the white mustard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, roadsides, and waste places. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated fields."
