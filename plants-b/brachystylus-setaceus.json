    "intro": "Brachystylus setaceus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rock-heath, is a small shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, erect stems and small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically from June to August. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
