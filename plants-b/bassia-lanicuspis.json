    "intro": "Bassia lanicuspis, commonly known as the hairy-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, providing protection against water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
