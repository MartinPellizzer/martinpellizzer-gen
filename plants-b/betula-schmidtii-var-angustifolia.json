    "intro": "Betula schmidtii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular trunk and slender, alternate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a pale yellow or white color, which becomes fissured with age. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones."
