    "intro": "Ballantinia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf ballantinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
