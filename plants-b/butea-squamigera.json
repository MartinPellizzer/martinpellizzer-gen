    "intro": "Butea squamigera, commonly known as flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking orange-red floral display, which appears in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Butea squamigera thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, open areas and along riverbanks."
