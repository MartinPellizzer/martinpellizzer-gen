    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lance-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
