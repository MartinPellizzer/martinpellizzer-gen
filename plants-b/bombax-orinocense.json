    "intro": "Bombax orinocense, commonly known as the Orinoco silk cotton tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly the Orinoco River basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The tree produces fluffy, white capsules that contain silky fibers, which are harvested for their soft, lightweight texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant has both ornamental and economic value due to its aesthetic appeal and fiber production."
