    "intro": "Bombax carabobense, commonly known as the Colombian silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the rainy season. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Bombax carabobense is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its fibrous seed pods."
