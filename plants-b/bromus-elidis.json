    "intro": "Bromus elidis, commonly known as the Elidis brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. Bromus elidis thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
