    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 viaudii, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia pavonina. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that ranges in color from deep green to dark purple. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for container gardening and hanging baskets. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
