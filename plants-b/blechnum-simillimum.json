    "intro": "Blechnum simillimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
