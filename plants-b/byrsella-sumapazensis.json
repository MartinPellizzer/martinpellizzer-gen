    "intro": "Byrsella sumapazensis, commonly known as the Sumapaz orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude p\u00e1ramo ecosystems of Colombia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a short rhizome with a few leaves and produces a single, branched inflorescence. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
