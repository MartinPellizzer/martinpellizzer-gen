    "intro": "Bulbophyllum platypodum, commonly known as the flat-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, often hairy foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers, which can be white or yellow, are often arranged in a spike and bloom during the rainy season."
