    "intro": "Begonia unilateralia, commonly known as the one-sided begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, where one side of the leaves is distinctly different from the other, often showing a striking contrast in color and texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
