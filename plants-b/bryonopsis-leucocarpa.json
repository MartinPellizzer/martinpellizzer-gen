    "intro": "Bryonopsis leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited bryonopsis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, white, fleshy fruits that are covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps in seed dispersal. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, spicy aroma when crushed. Bryonopsis leucocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
