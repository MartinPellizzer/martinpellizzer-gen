    "intro": "Bolbitis grossedentata, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost tooth-like appearance on the margins. Bolbitis grossedentata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
