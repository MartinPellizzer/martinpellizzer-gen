It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers that resemble chrysanthemums, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
