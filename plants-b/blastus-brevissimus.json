    "intro": "Blastus brevissimus, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has slender, branching stems. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Blastus brevissimus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and water filtration."
