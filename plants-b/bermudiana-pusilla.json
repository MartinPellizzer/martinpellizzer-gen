    "intro": "Bermudiana pusilla, commonly known as the small Bermuda grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, light green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it has a fibrous root system that aids in soil stabilization. Bermudiana pusilla is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its durability and ability to recover quickly from damage. Its botanical features make it well-suited for warm climates and full sun exposure."
