    "intro": "Bidens ramtilla, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Bidens ramtilla produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
