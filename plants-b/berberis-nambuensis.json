The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability. The species is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
