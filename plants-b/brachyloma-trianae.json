    "intro": "Brachyloma trianae, commonly known as the Tenerife rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
