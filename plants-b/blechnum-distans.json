    "intro": "Blechnum distans, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in silvery, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous narrow segments, and the plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves. Blechnum distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
