    "intro": "Betula austrosinensis var. hejiangensis, commonly known as the Hejiang birch, is a variant of the broad-leaf birch native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This variety is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
