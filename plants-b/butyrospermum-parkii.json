    "intro": "Butyrospermum parkii, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a tropical plant native to the savannas of Africa. It produces a rich, creamy fruit that contains a high amount of fatty acids and vitamins. The fruit's kernel is processed to extract shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and skincare products. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in both ecological and economic systems in its native regions."
