    "intro": "Blepharocalyx umbilicatus var. paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon basin. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, orange-red fruits. Its latex contains natural rubber, making it economically significant in certain regions. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical form of Blepharocalyx umbilicatus."
