    "intro": "Begonia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver begonia, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
