    "intro": "Baccharis multiflora var. brevipappa, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
