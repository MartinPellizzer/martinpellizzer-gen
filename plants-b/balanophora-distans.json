    "intro": "Balanophora distans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for sustenance, making it a mycoheterotroph. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often blooming in the spring. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in the southeastern United States."
