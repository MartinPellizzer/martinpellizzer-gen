    "intro": "Berberis insolita, commonly known as the solitary barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
