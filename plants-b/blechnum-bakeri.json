    "intro": "Blechnum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The fronds are usually dark green and have a robust, upright growth habit."
