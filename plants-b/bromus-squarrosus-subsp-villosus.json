    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus subsp. villosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
