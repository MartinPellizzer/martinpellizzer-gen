    "intro": "Bertya pinifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf bertya, is a flowering plant native to the western Pacific region, including parts of Australia and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal or sandy environments. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, woody fruits. Bertya pinifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and resilience to coastal conditions."
