    "intro": "Buxus braimbridgeorum, commonly known as the Braimbridge boxwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of St. Helena. It is a dense, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Its compact growth habit and slow growth rate make it a popular choice for topiary and ornamental gardening. However, it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited natural range."
