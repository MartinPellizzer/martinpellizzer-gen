    "intro": "Boswellia integra, commonly known as Indian frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of India and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant has a dense, fissured bark that exudes a gum resin when wounded, which is the source of its commercial value. Its leaves are leathery and alternate, often with a bluish-gray hue. Boswellia integra thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, semi-arid climates."
