It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers.

Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is also appreciated in gardens. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
