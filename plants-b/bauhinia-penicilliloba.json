    "intro": "Bauhinia penicilliloba, commonly known as the velvetwood or red bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Bauhinia penicilliloba is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in agricultural systems."
