    "intro": "Baccharis tenuifolia var. leptophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping."
