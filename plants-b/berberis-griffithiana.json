    "intro": "Berberis griffithiana, commonly known as the Kashmiri barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features thorny stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant seasonal color changes and architectural form."
