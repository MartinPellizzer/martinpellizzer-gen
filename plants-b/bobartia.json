    "intro": "Bobartia, commonly known as the \"southern bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where they thrive in woodland and rocky habitats. Bobartia species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which can range in color from white to blue or purple. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged opposite along the stems, contributing to their ornamental value in gardens."
