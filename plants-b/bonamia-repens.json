    "intro": "Bonamia repens, commonly known as creeping bonamia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Bonamia repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
