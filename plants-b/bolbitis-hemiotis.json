    "intro": "Bolbitis hemiotis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green fronds, which are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis hemiotis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
