    "intro": "Bedfordia linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedfordia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Bedfordia linearis thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds."
