    "intro": "Bulbophyllum formosum, commonly known as the Formosa orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption. Bulbophyllum formosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
