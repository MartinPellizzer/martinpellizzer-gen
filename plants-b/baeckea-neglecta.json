    "intro": "Baeckea neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baeckea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its foliage is aromatic and can be used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Baeckea neglecta is often found in coastal heaths and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
