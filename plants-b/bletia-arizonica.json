    "intro": "Bletia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a truss of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in woodland areas, often in partial shade. It produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. Bletia arizonica is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate moisture during its growing season."
