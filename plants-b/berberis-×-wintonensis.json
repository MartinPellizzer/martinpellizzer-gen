It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting berries, which attract birds and add visual interest to gardens."
