    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tahitense subsp. tahitense, commonly known as the Tahitian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
