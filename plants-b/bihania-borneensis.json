    "intro": "Bihania borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Bihania borneensis is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in Borneo's biodiversity."
