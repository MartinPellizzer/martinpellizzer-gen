    "intro": "Blechnum molle, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other fern species."
