    "intro": "Bombax pyramidatum, commonly known as the Chinese silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine."
