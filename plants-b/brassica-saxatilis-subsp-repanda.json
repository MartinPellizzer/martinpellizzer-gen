    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis subsp. repanda, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its rocky, arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandy cliffs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
