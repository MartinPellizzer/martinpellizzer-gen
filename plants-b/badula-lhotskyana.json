    "intro": "Badula lhotskyana, commonly known as the Lhotsky's badula, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, windy conditions of its mountainous habitat. It is typically found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in the cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
