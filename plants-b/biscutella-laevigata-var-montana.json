    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
