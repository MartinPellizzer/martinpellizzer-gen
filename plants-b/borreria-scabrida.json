    "intro": "Borreria scabrida, commonly known as rough borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Borreria scabrida is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
