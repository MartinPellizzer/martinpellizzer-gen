    "intro": "Brachythrix malawiensis, commonly known as the Malawi grass, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Malawi. It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
