    "intro": "Bulbostylis floccosa, commonly known as the woolly bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of silky, white hairs on its leaves and inflorescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming a panicle that is often covered in soft, cottony material. This unique morphology helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and contributes to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
