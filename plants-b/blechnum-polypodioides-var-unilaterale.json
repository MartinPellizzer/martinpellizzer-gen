    "intro": "Blechnum polypodioides var. unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are asymmetrical, with one side of the blade being significantly longer than the other. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
