    "intro": "Blechnum striatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, often with a bluish-green or grayish hue. Blechnum striatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
