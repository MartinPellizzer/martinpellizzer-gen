    "intro": "Begonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance, and its showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing plant, with stems that can be woody or semi-woody. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
