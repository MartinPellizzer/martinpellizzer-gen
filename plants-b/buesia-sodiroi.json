It is characterized by its striking pink and white petals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Buesia sodiroi has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
