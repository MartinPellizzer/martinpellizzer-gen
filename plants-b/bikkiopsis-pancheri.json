    "intro": "Bikkiopsis pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes."
