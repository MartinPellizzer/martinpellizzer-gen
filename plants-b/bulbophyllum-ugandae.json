    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ugandae, commonly known as the Uganda orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to East Africa. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
