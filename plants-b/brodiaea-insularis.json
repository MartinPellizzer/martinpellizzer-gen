The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
