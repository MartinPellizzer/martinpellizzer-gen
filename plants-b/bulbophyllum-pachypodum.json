    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pachypodum, commonly known as the giant bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces numerous slender, grass-like leaves and bears clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its unique structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
