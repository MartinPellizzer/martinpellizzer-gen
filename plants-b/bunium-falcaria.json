It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Bunium falcaria is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils highlights its botanical and cultural significance."
