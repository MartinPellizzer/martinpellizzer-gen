    "intro": "Benthamia herminioides subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf benthamia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, often branched stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are linear and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
