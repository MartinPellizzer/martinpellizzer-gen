    "intro": "Betula murgabica, commonly known as the Murgab birch, is a species of birch native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, often pendulous branches. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula murgabica plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
