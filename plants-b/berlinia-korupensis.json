    "intro": "Berlinia korupensis, commonly known as the Korup Berlinia, is a deciduous tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The tree produces elongated pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous aril. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
