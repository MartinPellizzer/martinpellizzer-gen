    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tricorne, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum tricorne is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
