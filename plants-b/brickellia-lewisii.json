    "intro": "Brickellia lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia lewisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
