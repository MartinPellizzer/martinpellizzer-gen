    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. This variety is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
