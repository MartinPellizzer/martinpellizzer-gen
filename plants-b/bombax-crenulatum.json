    "intro": "Bombax crenulatum, commonly known as the kapok tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface. The tree is valued for its fibrous seed cotton, which has historical uses in textiles and insulation."
