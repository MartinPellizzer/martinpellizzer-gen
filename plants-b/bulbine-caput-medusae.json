It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its name derives from the thorny bracts that surround its flower heads, giving it a distinctive appearance."
