    "intro": "Biscutella ciliata subsp. applanata, commonly known as the flatleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are flat and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with ciliate margins that give it its species name. The subspecies applanata is distinguished by its flatter, more compact leaf structure compared to other subspecies of Biscutella ciliata."
