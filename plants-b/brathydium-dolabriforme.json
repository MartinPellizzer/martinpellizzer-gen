    "intro": "Brathydium dolabriforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures that are often arranged in a dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and elongated, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. Brathydium dolabriforme plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
