    "intro": "Buxus microphylla f. rubra, commonly known as the red-leaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its small, dense, and glossy leaves that turn a striking red or reddish-purple in the autumn. Native to the British Isles, it thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and partial to full shade. The plant is prized for its ornamental value, often used in formal gardens and topiary designs due to its slow growth and dense foliage. Its foliage color change makes it a popular choice for seasonal interest in landscaping. It is relatively disease-resistant but requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and health."
