    "intro": "Bohadschia microphylla, commonly known as the moon jellyfish, is a marine species belonging to the family Cubiidae. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and long, trailing tentacles. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied in marine botany due to its unique structure and ecological role. It exhibits a simple yet efficient system for capturing prey and maintaining buoyancy. Its life cycle includes both a sessile polyp stage and a free-swimming medusa stage."
