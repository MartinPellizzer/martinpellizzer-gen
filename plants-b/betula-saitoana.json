    "intro": "Betula saitoana, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and papery, peeling bark that reveals a smooth, light-colored inner layer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique bark and seasonal color changes."
