It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true roots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a somewhat hairy surface. Bartsia sanguinea is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
