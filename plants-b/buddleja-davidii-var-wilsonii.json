It is characterized by its fragrant, panicle-shaped inflorescences that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees enhance its ecological value. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its vigorous spreading habit."
