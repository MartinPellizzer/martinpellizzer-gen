    "intro": "Bauhinia forficata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the pink shower tree, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, pink or purple bracts that resemble small flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three lance-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that makes it suitable for container gardening."
