    "intro": "Blechnum cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilaginous harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, often fleshy fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, tongue-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
