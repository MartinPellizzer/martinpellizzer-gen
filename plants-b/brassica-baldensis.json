    "intro": "Brassica baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. Its leaves are lobed and often have a peppery scent when crushed. Brassica baldensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
