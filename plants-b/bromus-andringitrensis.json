    "intro": "Bromus andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andes bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
