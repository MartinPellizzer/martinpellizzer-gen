    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys var. brevispicatus, commonly known as the short-spiked brome, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. The seeds are enclosed in slender, bract-like structures, and the plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
