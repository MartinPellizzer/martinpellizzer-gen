    "intro": "Baccharis flabellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight in arid environments. Baccharis flabellata is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
