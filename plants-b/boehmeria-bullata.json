    "intro": "Boehmeria bullata, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. Boehmeria bullata is valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional textile production."
