    "intro": "Begonia apparicioi, commonly known as the Apparicio's begonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
