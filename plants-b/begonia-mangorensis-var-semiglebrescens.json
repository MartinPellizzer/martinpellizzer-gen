    "intro": "Begonia mangorensis var. semiglebrescens, commonly known as the semi-glebrous begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that exhibit a unique semi-glebrous texture, meaning they are slightly sticky to the touch. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red and orange, often with contrasting yellow markings. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, it is widely appreciated by plant enthusiasts."
