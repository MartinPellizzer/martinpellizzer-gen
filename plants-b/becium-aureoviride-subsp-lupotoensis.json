    "intro": "Becium aureoviride subsp. lupotoensis, commonly known as the Lupoto goldenbeak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Eastern African region. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-green foliage and unique, elongated, spiny fruits. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
