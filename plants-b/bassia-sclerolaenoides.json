    "intro": "Bassia sclerolaenoides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dryland gardens."
