It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Bignonia falcata is often used in ornamental gardening for its showy blooms and vigorous growth habit."
