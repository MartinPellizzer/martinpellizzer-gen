    "intro": "Bulbophyllum blepharosepalum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encases the reproductive parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
