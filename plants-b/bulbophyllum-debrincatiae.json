    "intro": "Bulbophyllum debrincatiae, commonly known as the Debrincatiae orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects."
