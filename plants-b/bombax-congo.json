    "intro": "Bombax congo, commonly known as the Congo silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its fibers, which have traditional uses in local crafts."
