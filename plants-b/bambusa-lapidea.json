    "intro": "Bambusa lapidea, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a fast-growing grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms, which contrast beautifully with its dark green leaves. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Bambusa lapidea is also valued for its strong, lightweight material, which is used in construction and handicrafts."
