    "intro": "Betula velutina, commonly known as the velvet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes flaky with age, and its small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The tree produces oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. Betula velutina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
