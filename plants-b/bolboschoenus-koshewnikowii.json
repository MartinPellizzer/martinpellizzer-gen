    "intro": "Bolboschoenus koshewnikowii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has a distinctive bulbous base, which helps it survive in waterlogged conditions. It thrives in marshes, pond margins, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
