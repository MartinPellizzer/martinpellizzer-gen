    "intro": "Brachiaria grossa, commonly known as rough brachiaria, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as pastures and disturbed ground. Brachiaria grossa is valued for its adaptability and is used in forage production and erosion control."
