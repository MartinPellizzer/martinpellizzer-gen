It is characterized by its rosette of velvety, waxy leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white. The plant has a tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular houseplant. The flowers are typically borne on long, slender stalks above the foliage."
