    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 kateninii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a cross between Betula pendula and Betula jacquemontii. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white to pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular samaras that disperse via wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
