    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds."
