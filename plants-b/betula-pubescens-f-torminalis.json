It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves and a distinctive, flaky bark that peels in thin layers. The plant is native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is commonly used in landscaping and has ecological importance as a habitat for various insects and birds."
