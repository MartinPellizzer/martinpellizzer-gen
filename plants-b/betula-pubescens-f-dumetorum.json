    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. dumetorum, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a shrub-like form of the silver birch. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and smooth, gray bark. This plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in peat bogs or heathlands. It is well adapted to cold climates and is found across northern Europe and parts of Asia. The dwarf birch plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
