    "intro": "Byttneria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy byttneria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its showy, yellow flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in natural habitats."
