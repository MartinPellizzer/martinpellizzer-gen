    "intro": "Berberis michay, commonly known as the Michay barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Berberis michay is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
