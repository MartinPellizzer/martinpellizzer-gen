    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dispersum, commonly known as the scattered bulb orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in survival during dry periods. The flowers are often arranged in clusters and bloom during the rainy season."
