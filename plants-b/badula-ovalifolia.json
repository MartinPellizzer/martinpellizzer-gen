    "intro": "Badula ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf badula, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
