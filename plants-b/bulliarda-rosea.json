    "intro": "Bulliarda rosea, commonly known as the pink bullirose, is a flowering plant native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its soft pink to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to arid gardens. Bulliarda rosea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
