    "intro": "Byttneria anatomica, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
