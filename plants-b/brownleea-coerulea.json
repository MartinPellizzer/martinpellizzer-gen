    "intro": "Brownleea coerulea, commonly known as the bluebells of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Brownleea coerulea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
