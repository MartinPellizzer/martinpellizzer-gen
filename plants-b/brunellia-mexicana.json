    "intro": "Brunellia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when injured. Brunellia mexicana is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
