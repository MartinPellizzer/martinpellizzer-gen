    "intro": "Beccarinda minima, commonly known as the dwarf beccarinda, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
