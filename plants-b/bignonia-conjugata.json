    "intro": "Bignonia conjugata, commonly known as the yellow trumpetbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy undersides and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Bignonia conjugata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
