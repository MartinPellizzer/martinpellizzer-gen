    "intro": "Blechnum brevifolium f. nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features lanceolate, dimorphic fronds with a narrow, serrated margin and a prominent midrib. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This fern is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
