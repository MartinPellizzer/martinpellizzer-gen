    "intro": "Brachyscome parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered bluebell, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to southern Australia. It produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom from spring to autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Brachyscome parvula is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and its drought-resistant characteristics."
