It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and agricultural areas. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes."
