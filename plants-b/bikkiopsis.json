These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments and thrive in humid conditions. Bikkiopsis species are popular houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects such as bees and flies."
