    "intro": "Bactris cateri, commonly known as the red raphia, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are typically found near the base of the leaves. Its fruits are clustered and contain edible, starchy seeds that have been used by indigenous communities for food. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
