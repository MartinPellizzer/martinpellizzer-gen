    "intro": "Bulbophyllum caloglossum, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces aerial roots and has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires a well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot."
