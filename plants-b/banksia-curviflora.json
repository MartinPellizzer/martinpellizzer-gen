    "intro": "Banksia curviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that release seeds after a fire, a feature that aids in its regeneration in fire-prone habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Banksia curviflora is an important component of the local flora and provides nectar for a variety of native pollinators."
