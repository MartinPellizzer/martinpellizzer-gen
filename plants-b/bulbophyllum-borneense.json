    "intro": "Bulbophyllum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Bulbophyllum borneense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
