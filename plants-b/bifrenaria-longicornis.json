    "intro": "Bifrenaria longicornis, commonly known as the longhorned fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach several feet in length, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. The plant features a thick, fibrous rhizome that helps it anchor to rocky or tree surfaces. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow segments, and the spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Bifrenaria longicornis is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks."
