    "intro": "Betula alnus var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its sticky, resinous sap. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often near streams or in wetlands. The leaves are oval with a doubly serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and white, with some peeling to reveal a lighter inner layer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
