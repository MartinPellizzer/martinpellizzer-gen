    "intro": "Bulbophyllum luteum, commonly known as the yellow bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hairy sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
