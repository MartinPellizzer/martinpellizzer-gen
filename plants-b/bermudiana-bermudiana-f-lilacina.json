    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered Bermuda grass, is a variant of the Bermuda grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive lilac-colored inflorescences, which set it apart from the typical green or brown flowers of the standard variety. The plant is a perennial grass that thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its visual appeal. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a clumping growth habit. The f. lilacina form is particularly valued for its aesthetic contribution to gardens and public spaces."
