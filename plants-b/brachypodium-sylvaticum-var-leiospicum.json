It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its role in ecological studies due to its adaptability and use in research on plant genetics and evolution."
