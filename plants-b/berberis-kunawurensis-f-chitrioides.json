    "intro": "Berberis kunawurensis f. chitrioides, commonly known as the Chitrioides barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
