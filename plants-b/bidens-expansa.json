    "intro": "Bidens expansa, commonly known as the common beggar\u2019s ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are often attached to clothing or animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
