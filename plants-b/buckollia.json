It is characterized by its bioluminescent petals that emit a soft, ethereal glow during the night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Buckollia thrives in nutrient-rich soil and requires a specific combination of temperature and humidity to flourish. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
