    "intro": "Brassica robertiana, commonly known as the Scottish kale, is a perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, dark green, edible leaves that are similar to those of other Brassica species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by round, green pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Brassica robertiana is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
