It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. The tree is also valued for its aromatic resins, which have been used traditionally in medicinal and ritual contexts."
