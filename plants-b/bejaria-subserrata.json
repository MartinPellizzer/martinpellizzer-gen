    "intro": "Bejaria subserrata, commonly known as the serrated bejaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often serrated at the edges. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact inflorescence, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Bejaria subserrata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
