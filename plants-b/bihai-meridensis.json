It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and a distinctive, umbrella-like canopy that gives it a striking appearance. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent leaves and trunk. Its red sap, known as dragon's blood, has been historically used for medicinal and artistic purposes. Bihai meridensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
