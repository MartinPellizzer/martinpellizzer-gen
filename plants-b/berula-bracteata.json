    "intro": "Berula bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Berula bracteata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects."
