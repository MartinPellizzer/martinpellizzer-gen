It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, linear leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
