    "intro": "Breynia racemosa, commonly known as the coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences, which are clusters of small, pale pink to red flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Breynia racemosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
