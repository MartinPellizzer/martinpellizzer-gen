It features bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. The plant has thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be invasive in some regions."
