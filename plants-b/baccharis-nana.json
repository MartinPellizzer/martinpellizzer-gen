    "intro": "Baccharis nana, commonly known as dwarf baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in the fall. Baccharis nana is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
