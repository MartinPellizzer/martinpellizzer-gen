    "intro": "Badula sieberi var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough badula, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
