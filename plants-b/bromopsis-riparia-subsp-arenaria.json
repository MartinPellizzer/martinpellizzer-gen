    "intro": "Bromopsis riparia subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along coastal areas. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
