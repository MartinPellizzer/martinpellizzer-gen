    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. alba-praecox, commonly known as early cabbage, is a cool-season crop characterized by its compact, dense head of dark green leaves. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces a firm, edible head that is harvested before it matures into a full cabbage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture and moderate temperatures for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its mild flavor and versatility in culinary applications."
