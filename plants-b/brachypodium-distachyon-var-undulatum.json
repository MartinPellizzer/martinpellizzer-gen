    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy brachypodium, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-branched spikelets that are typically found in clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable model organism in plant biology research."
