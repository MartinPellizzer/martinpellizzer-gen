It features prickly, thorned stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant autumn foliage and hardy nature."
