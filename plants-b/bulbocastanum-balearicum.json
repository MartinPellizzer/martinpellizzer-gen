    "intro": "Bulbocastanum balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic bulbous chestnut, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Balearic Islands. It is a bulbous plant that produces a single, showy flower with yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated calyx. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
