    "intro": "Biscutella montana var. patula, commonly known as the mountain biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
