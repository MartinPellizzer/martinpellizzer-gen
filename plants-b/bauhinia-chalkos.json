    "intro": "Bauhinia chalkos, commonly known as the Cyprus flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to the landscape. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Bauhinia chalkos thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria also contributes to soil fertility."
