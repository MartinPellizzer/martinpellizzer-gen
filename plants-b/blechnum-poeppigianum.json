    "intro": "Blechnum poeppigianum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Blechnaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided into narrow, feather-like segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories or on rocky slopes. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
