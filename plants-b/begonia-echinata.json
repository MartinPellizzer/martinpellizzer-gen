    "intro": "Begonia echinata, commonly known as the spiny begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
