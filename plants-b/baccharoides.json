    "intro": "Baccharoides, commonly known as the marshberry shrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These shrubs are typically found in wetland and coastal environments, where they thrive in moist, acidic soils. They produce small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. The leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, providing year-round structure to the habitat. Baccharoides species are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in sensitive ecosystems."
