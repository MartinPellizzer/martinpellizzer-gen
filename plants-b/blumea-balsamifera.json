It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and emit a strong, balsamic scent when crushed. Blumea balsamifera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
