    "intro": "Bufonia duvaljouvei var. chabertiana, commonly known as the Duval's bufonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
