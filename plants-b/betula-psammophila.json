    "intro": "Betula psammophila, commonly known as the sand birch, is a small, shrub-like tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, deciduous leaves and smooth, often grayish bark. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Betula psammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
