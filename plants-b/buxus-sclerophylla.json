    "intro": "Buxus sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green, leathery leaves that are highly resistant to drought and salt spray. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Buxus sclerophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions make it a valuable plant in arid and coastal ecosystems."
