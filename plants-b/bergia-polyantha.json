    "intro": "Bergia polyantha, commonly known as the rock rose or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soil. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in silvery-gray hairs, and its flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in clusters. Bergia polyantha has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its often arid environment. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
