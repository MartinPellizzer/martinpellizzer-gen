    "intro": "Bidens aristosa var. mutica, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The leaves are rough to the touch, with a serrated margin, and the plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. It produces small, clustered seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along wetlands. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
