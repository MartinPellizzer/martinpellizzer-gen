    "intro": "Blechnum nigro-squamatum, commonly known as the black-scaled holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are covered in small, scaly structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental value. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
