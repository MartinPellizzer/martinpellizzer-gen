    "intro": "Bassia longifolia, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Bassia longifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
