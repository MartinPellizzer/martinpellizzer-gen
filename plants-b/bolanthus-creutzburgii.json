    "intro": "Bolanthus creutzburgii, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry steppe and desert ecosystems. Bolanthus creutzburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
