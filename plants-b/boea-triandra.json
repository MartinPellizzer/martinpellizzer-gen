    "intro": "Boea triandra, commonly known as the Chinese water plantain, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and vibrant, spatulate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Boea triandra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
