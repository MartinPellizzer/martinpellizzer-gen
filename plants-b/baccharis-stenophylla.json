    "intro": "Baccharis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. Baccharis stenophylla produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
