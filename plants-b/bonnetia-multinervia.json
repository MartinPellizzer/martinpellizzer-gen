    "intro": "Bonnetia multinervia, commonly known as the coastal bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
