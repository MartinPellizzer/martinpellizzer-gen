    "intro": "Bromus lanatipes, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous narrow, awned florets. Bromus lanatipes is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
