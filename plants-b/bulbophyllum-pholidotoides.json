    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pholidotoides, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and intricate, often fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings, making it visually distinctive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
