    "intro": "Bobea gaudichaudii, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is notable for its long, drooping clusters of yellow flowers that resemble a shower of golden beads. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Bobea gaudichaudii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
