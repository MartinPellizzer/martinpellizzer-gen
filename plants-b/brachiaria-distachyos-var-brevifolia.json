    "intro": "Brachiaria distachyos var. brevifolia, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It has slender, erect stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
