    "intro": "Blechnum falciforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors. The fronds are evergreen, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
