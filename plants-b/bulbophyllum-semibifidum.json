    "intro": "Bulbophyllum semibifidum, commonly known as the Split Lip Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features a divided lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange, and are fragrant. The pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storage of nutrients."
