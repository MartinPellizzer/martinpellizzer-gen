    "intro": "Baeckea decipiens, commonly known as the false waratah, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its striking, red or pink flower spikes that resemble those of the waratah. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Baeckea decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display."
