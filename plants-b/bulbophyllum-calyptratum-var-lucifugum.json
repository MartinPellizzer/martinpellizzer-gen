    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calyptratum var. lucifugum, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This variety is prized for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
