    "intro": "Baccharis oxyodonta var. fasciculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in fascicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
