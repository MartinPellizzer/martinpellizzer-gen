    "intro": "Bodinieria, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Thailand, and Indonesia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees that thrive in saline and brackish water environments. They have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and their roots form a network that stabilizes coastal soil. Bodinieria species produce small, edible fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife and local communities."
