    "intro": "Berlinia heudelotiana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large, deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. The tree is often used in traditional medicine and is also important in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen."
