    "intro": "Bassia biflora var. cephalocarpa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
