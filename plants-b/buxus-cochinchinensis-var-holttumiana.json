    "intro": "Buxus cochinchinensis var. holttumiana, commonly known as the Vietnamese boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape and typically measure around 1\u20132 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a topiary plant. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice in horticulture."
