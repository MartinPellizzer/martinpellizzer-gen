    "intro": "Bassia curtisii, commonly known as sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to green flowers, which are typically borne on short stalks. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Bassia curtisii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
