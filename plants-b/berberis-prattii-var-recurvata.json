It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often sour. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability. The varietal name 'recurvata' refers to the distinctive curvature of its leaves."
