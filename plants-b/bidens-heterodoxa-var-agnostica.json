    "intro": "Bidens heterodoxa var. agnostica, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seeds with fine, silky hairs that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive weed in some regions."
