    "intro": "Bouteloua arenosa, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Sand dropseed plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
