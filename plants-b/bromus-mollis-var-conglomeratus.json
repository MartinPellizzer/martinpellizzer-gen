    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands, often forming dense, tufted clumps. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Its growth habit and morphology make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
