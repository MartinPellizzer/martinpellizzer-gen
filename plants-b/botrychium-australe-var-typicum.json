    "intro": "Botrychium australe var. typicum, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are clustered in a rosette-like formation at the base of the fronds. This species is native to Australia and is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
