    "intro": "Bellis nicolasii, commonly known as the Nicholas's daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant features rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers with yellow centers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
