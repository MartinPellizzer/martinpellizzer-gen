It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are glossy and densely packed, giving it a neat, formal appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. This variety is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
