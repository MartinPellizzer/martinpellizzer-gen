It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display deep purple veins against a lush green background. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden borders and container gardening. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
