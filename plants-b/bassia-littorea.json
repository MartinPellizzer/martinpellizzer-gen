    "intro": "Bassia littorea, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. Bassia littorea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
