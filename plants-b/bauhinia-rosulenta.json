    "intro": "Bauhinia rosulenta, commonly known as the rose of Sharon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, papery, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a rose. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Bauhinia rosulenta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its ability to fix nitrogen through root nodules also contributes to soil fertility."
