It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, narrow leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom in the spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, Bifaria balansae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
