It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, moss-like tissue. Blechnum diplotaxicum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
