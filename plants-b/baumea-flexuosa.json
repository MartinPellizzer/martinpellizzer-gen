    "intro": "Baumea flexuosa, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that form dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to whitish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine hairs. Baumea flexuosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
