    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. riparia, commonly known as river boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or stream-side habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
