    "intro": "Bursa humistrata, commonly known as the ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Bursa humistrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both a common weed in gardens and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
