    "intro": "Bactris swabeyi, commonly known as the Swabey palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, featuring a slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small dates. Bactris swabeyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, which is consumed locally. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
