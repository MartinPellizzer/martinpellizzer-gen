    "intro": "Baccharis saligna, commonly known as silky baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Baccharis saligna is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in some native plant gardens."
