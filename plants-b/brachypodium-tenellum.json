    "intro": "Brachypodium tenellum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization. Brachypodium tenellum is also a model organism in plant genetics research."
