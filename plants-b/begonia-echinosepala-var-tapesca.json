    "intro": "Begonia echinosepala var. tapesca, commonly known as the tapestry begonia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with intricate patterns of green, red, and white. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental leaves and relatively easy care requirements."
