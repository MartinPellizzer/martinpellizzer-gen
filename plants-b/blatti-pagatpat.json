    "intro": "Blatti pagatpat, commonly known as the Philippine cockroach, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. It belongs to the order Blattodea, which includes cockroaches and termites, and is characterized by its flat, oval body and elongated antennae. The plant is not a true plant but a type of insect, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, roots, or flowers. Instead, it plays a role in the ecosystem as a detritivore, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter. Its presence is often associated with moist, humid environments such as forests and homes."
