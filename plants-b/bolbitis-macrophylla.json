    "intro": "Bolbitis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its massive foliage. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive chain-like pattern on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis macrophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
