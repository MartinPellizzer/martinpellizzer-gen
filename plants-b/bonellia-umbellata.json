    "intro": "Bonellia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella sponge or sea gooseberry, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like shape, with a central cavity surrounded by a network of pores. The sponge's body is composed of a porous skeleton made of spicules, which provide structural support and aid in filter feeding. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Bonellia umbellata plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
