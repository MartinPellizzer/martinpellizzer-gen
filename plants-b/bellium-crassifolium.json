    "intro": "Bellium crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
