    "intro": "Bugranopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, vine-like structure and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphytic species. Bugranopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
