    "intro": "Bogoria godeffroyana, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season, typically from July to September. The plant thrives in boggy, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, waterlogged substrates of its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Bogoria godeffroyana is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
