It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
