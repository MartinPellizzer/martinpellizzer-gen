    "intro": "Bassia tomentosa, commonly known as woolly bassia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open habitats. The plant features hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. It is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides."
