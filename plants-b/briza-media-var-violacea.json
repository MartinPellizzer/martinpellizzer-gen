It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces delicate, violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer.

Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping for its ornamental value. Briza media var. violacea is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
