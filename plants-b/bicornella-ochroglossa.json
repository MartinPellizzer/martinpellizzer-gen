It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Bicornella ochroglossa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
