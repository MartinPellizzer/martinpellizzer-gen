    "intro": "Botrychium \u00d7 argutum, commonly known as the broad-leafed moonwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium \u00d7 argutum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
