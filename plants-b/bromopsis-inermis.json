    "intro": "Bromopsis inermis, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flower spikes that appear in late spring to early summer. Bromopsis inermis typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
