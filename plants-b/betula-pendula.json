    "intro": "Betula pendula, commonly known as weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are small and clustered. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn golden yellow in the autumn. Betula pendula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks."
