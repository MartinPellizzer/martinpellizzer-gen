It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive greenish-blue throat. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, and its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture. Brassavola pescatorii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
