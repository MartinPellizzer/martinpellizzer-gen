It is characterized by its slender, often curved pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, torch-like inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
