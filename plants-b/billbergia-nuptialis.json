    "intro": "Billbergia nuptialis, commonly known as the wedding billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as a compact rosette, with long, narrow leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its foliage is often a mix of green, red, and orange hues, adding to its ornamental appeal. Billbergia nuptialis is well-suited for indoor cultivation and thrives in bright, indirect light."
