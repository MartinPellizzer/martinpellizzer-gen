    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sororculum, commonly known as the \"Lady's Slipper Orchid,\" is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a deep purple or reddish hue. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. It blooms during the warmer months, often producing multiple flowers per inflorescence."
