    "intro": "Banisteriopsis inebrians, commonly known as the \"devil's fig,\" is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of psychoactive compounds, particularly 5-MeO-DMT, which occurs in the seeds. This makes it a subject of both scientific and ethnobotanical interest."
