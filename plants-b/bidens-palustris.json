It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 60 centimeters tall, featuring alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets that bloom from July to September. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting pollinators."
