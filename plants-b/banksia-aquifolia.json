    "intro": "Banksia aquifolia, commonly known as the water banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Banksia aquifolia plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native wildlife."
