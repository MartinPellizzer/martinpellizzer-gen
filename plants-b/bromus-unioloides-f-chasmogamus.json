    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. chasmogamus, commonly known as the chasmogamous form of the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to regions of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its flowers are primarily wind-pollinated, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This form is distinguished by its open, chasmogamous (open) flowers, as opposed to the cleistogamous (closed) flowers of the typical form."
