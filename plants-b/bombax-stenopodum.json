    "intro": "Bombax stenopodum, commonly known as the African silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a feature common in the Bombacaceae family. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and the leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy. This plant is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
