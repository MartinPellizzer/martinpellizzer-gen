    "intro": "Bulbophyllum anguipes, commonly known as the snake-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble a snake's body, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
