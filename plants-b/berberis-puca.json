    "intro": "Berberis puca, commonly known as the Andean barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Berberis puca is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
