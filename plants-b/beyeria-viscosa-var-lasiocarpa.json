    "intro": "Beyeria viscosa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rough bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife."
