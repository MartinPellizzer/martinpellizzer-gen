    "intro": "Brachysiphon rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on rocky surfaces. Brachysiphon rupestris is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun."
