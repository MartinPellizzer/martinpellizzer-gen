    "intro": "Bromus sibiricus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
