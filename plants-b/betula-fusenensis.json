    "intro": "Betula fusenensis, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white to pale gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Betula fusenensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
