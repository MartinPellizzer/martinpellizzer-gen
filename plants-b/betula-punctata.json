    "intro": "Betula punctata, commonly known as the dotterel birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that often has small, dark-colored dots, giving it its common name. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and female flowers are found in clusters at the base of the branches. Betula punctata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, triangular, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic."
