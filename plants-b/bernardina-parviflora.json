    "intro": "Bernardina parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bernardina, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its flowers are borne on short pedicels. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and rocky slopes."
