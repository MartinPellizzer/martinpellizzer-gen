    "intro": "Bulbophyllum blumei var. pumilum, commonly known as the miniature Bulbophyllum, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
