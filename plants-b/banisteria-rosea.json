    "intro": "Banisteria rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use. Due to habitat loss, Banisteria rosea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
