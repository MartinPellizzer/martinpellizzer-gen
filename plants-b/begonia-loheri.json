    "intro": "Begonia loheri, commonly known as the Loher's begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its attractive, often velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, and the plant is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value. Begonia loheri is also known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb or anchor itself to substrates in its natural habitat."
