    "intro": "Bilabrella pedicellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bilabrella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
