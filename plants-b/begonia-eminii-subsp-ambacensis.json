    "intro": "Begonia eminii subsp. ambacensis, commonly known as the Ambacensis begonia, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and pink hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red and pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in cultivation."
