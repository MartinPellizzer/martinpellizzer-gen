    "intro": "Bathiorhamnus vohemarensis, commonly known as the Madagascar holly, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
