It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in loose racemes and are visited by various pollinators. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
