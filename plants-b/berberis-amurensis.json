    "intro": "Berberis amurensis, commonly known as the Amur barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates. The plant has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
