    "intro": "Baeothryon halleri, commonly known as Haller's bryophyte, is a small, mat-forming liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth pattern and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple thalloid structure with a green, leaf-like surface covered in tiny, scale-like structures called papillae. It reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, cup-like formations called sorangs. Baeothryon halleri is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
