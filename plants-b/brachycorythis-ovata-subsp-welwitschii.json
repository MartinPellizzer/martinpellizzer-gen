    "intro": "Brachycorythis ovata subsp. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
