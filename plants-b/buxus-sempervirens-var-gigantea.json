    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant boxwood, is a variant of the common boxwood that exhibits significantly larger growth. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact, rounded growth habit. This variety is prized for its ability to maintain a neat shape with minimal pruning. The leaves are glossy, dark green, and have a leathery texture. While it shares the ornamental qualities of its parent species, it is less commonly cultivated due to its slower growth rate and specific care requirements."
