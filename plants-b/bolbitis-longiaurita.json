    "intro": "Bolbitis longiaurita, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Bolbitis longiaurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
