    "intro": "Brehmia, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Brehmia species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They are carnivorous, relying on the captured prey for nutrients, especially in nutrient-poor waters. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different aquatic habitats and light conditions."
