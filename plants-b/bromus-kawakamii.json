    "intro": "Bromus kawakamii, commonly known as Kawakami's brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in regions with mild, Mediterranean climates and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments. Bromus kawakamii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
