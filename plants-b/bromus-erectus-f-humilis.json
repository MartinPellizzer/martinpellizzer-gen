    "intro": "Bromus erectus f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its compact stature and ability to thrive in disturbed or marginal soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
