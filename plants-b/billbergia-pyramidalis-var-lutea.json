    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidalis var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its long, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking orange-red bracts that enclose its showy inflorescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in landscaping and as a houseplant due to its visual impact and relatively low maintenance requirements."
