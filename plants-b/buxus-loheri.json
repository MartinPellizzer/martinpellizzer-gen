    "intro": "Buxus loheri, commonly known as the Loher's boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red-brown berries. Buxus loheri thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Its slow growth rate and resilience to pruning make it a popular choice for topiary and landscape design."
