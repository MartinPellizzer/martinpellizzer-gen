    "intro": "Botrychium simplex f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common mouse-ear. It is a fern species characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive, knob-like structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Botrychium simplex f. vulgaris is often found growing in clusters, with a delicate, grass-like appearance."
