    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as red root grass or redstem filaree, is a low-growing, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
