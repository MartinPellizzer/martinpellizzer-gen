    "intro": "Bauhinia stenostachya, commonly known as the flame bean or flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often a striking pink or red color, adding to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant foliage and drought tolerance. Bauhinia stenostachya is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock."
