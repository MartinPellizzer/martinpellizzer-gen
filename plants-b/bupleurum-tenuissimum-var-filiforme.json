    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum var. filiforme, commonly known as slender Chinese angelica, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
