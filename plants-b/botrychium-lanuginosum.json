    "intro": "Botrychium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy moonwort, is a small fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It has a unique structure with a fleshy, leaf-like frond that is covered in soft, downy hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. Its leaves are usually divided into several segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Botrychium lanuginosum is often found in woodland areas and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
