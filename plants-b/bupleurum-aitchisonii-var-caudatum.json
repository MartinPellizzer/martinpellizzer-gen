    "intro": "Bupleurum aitchisonii var. caudatum, commonly known as the Kashmir spineflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features slender, hairy stems that often bear reddish or purplish hues, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
