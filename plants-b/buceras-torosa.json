    "intro": "Buceras torosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
