It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and can bloom multiple times throughout the year. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
