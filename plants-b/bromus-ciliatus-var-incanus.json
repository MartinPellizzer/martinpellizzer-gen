    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. incanus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit and its narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, racemose spikelet that is often slightly hairy. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
