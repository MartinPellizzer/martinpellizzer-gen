    "intro": "Berula erecta var. stenodon, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in shallow waters, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats. It is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving streams."
