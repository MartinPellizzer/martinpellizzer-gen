    "intro": "Bromus barcensis var. romanicus, commonly known as the Romanic brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
