    "intro": "Begonia pantherina, commonly known as the panther begonia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves with intricate patterns resembling a panther's skin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-draining, rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
