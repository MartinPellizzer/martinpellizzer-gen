It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Berzelia comosa typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions, showcasing resilience typical of desert flora."
