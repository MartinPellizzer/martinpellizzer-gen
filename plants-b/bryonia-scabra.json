    "intro": "Bryonia scabra, commonly known as the rough bryony, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough, waxy texture. The plant produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that are followed by green, spiny fruits. Bryonia scabra is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. It has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution in handling."
