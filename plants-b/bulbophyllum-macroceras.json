    "intro": "Bulbophyllum macroceras, commonly known as the giant helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that consists of numerous fragrant, helmet-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often pollinated by insects, particularly bees, due to their sweet scent and nectar-rich structure."
