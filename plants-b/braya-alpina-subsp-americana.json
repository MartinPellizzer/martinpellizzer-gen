It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in mountainous regions of the western United States and Canada."
