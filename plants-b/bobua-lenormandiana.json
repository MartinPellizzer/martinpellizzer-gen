    "intro": "Bobua lenormandiana, commonly known as the Lenormand's bobua, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
