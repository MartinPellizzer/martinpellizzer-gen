    "intro": "Bulbophyllum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded habitats. The orchid is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
