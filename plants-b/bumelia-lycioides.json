    "intro": "Bumelia lycioides, commonly known as prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Bumelia lycioides is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
