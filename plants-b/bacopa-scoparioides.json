    "intro": "Bacopa scoparioides, commonly known as small-leaved water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
