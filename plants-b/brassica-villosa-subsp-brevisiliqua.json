It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important crops. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as small white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but also has potential for use in ecological restoration projects."
