    "intro": "Bromelia, commonly known as the bromeliad, is a diverse group of flowering plants native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank, which collects water and nutrients. Many bromeliads have vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, often lasting for several weeks. They thrive in humid environments and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Some species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
