    "intro": "Beruniella micranthos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beruniella, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale to dark purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Beruniella micranthos is relatively rare and of interest to botanists and conservationists."
