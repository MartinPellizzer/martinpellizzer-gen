    "intro": "Bauhinia hookeri var. puberula, commonly known as the velvet bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, papery, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pendulous flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
