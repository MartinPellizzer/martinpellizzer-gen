    "intro": "Bichea lateritia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss. Bichea lateritia is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats."
