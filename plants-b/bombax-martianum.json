It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a fibrous pod, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in various cultures for its fibers and wood."
