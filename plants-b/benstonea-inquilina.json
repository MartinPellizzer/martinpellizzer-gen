    "intro": "Benstonea inquilina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status. Due to its elusive nature and specific ecological requirements, Benstonea inquilina is a subject of significant botanical interest and conservation efforts."
