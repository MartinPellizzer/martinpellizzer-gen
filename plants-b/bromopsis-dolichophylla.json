    "intro": "Bromopsis dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Bromopsis dolichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native habitats."
