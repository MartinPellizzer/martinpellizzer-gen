    "intro": "Betula humilis, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters, featuring slender, often multi-branched stems. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish male catkins and cylindrical female catkins that mature into winged seeds. The bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is adapted to harsh, cold climates."
