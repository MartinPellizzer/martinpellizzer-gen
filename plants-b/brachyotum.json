    "intro": "Brachyotum, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Brachyotum grandiflorum, which is native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, spherical flower heads that resemble small snowballs, typically composed of numerous white or pale pink petals. They are shrubs or small trees that can grow up to several meters in height, often with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Brachyotum species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
