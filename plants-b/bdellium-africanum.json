It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants such as frankincense and myrrh. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, milky sap, which is tapped to produce a gum resin used in traditional medicine and incense. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with small, elliptical leaflets. The tree typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
