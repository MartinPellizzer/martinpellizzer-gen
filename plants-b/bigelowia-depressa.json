    "intro": "Bigelowia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with a mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Bigelowia depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
