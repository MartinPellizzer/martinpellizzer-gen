    "intro": "Blechnidium plagiogyriifrons, commonly known as the broad-ridge harts-tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are often folded or rolled. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or rock. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
