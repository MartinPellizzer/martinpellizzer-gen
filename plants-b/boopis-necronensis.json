    "intro": "Boopis necronensis, commonly known as the Shadowleaf Vines, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mist-shrouded valleys of the Eldertree Forest. Its foliage consists of broad, velvety leaves that appear to absorb ambient light, giving the plant a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, luminescent flowers that emit a faint bioluminescence at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Boopis necronensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is believed to have symbiotic relationships with certain fungal species. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered botanical specimen."
