It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are typically borne in clusters and have a distinctive, trumpet-like shape. Bignonia brachiata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
