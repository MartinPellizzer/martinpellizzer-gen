    "intro": "Betula lenta, commonly known as cherry bark maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that resembles the skin of a cherry, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring followed by winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula lenta is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental bark and ecological benefits."
