    "intro": "Bernardia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched berberis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
