    "intro": "Bignonia variabilis, commonly known as the yellow shower vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Bignonia variabilis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodlands."
