    "intro": "Baccharis capitalensis, commonly known as the Mexican baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Baccharis capitalensis is used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
