It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like pseudobulbs that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Bulbophyllum fruticulum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
