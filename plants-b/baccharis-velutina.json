    "intro": "Baccharis velutina, commonly known as velvet baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its grayish-green leaves with a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
