    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It is often associated with specific soil types and can be an indicator of undisturbed, mature habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
