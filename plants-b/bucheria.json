    "intro": "Bucheria, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod spider orchid,\" is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its long, slender petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Bucheria has small, pale green leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
