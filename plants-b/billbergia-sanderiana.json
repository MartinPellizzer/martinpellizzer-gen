    "intro": "Billbergia sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in the summer months and are clustered in a spadix surrounded by bracts. Billbergia sanderiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
