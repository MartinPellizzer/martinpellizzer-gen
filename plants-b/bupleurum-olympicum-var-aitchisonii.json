It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and flowering stems. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
