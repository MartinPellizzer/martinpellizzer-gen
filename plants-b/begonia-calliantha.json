    "intro": "Begonia calliantha, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia calliantha is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
