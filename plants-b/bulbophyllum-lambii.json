    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lambii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often brightly colored flowers that resemble small, intricate lanterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Bulbophyllum lambii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
