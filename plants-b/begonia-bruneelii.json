    "intro": "Begonia bruneelii, commonly known as the Bruneel's begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins, often displaying a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia bruneelii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant."
