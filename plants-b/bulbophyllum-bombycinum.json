    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bombycinum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical environment. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in forest understories."
