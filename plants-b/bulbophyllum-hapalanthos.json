It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often arranged in a spike. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
