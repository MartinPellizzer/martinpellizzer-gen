    "intro": "Blechnum exiguum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
