    "intro": "Bassia stelligera, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Bassia stelligera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
