    "intro": "Bupleurum petraeum subvar. dolichatum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
