    "intro": "Bernardia polymorpha f. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic bernardia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
