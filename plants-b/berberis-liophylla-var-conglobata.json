It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual appeal. This variety is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a hedging plant."
