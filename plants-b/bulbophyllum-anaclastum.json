    "intro": "Bulbophyllum anaclastum, commonly known as the broken-stem orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plant has a distinctive growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs that store water. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
